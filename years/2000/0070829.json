 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study questions related to\r\nso-called  nonlinear \"functional differential equations\" and, separately,\r\nto questions concerning iterates of maps which do not increase\r\ndistance in some metric. Roughly speaking, a functional differential\r\nequation is one in which the rate of change of an unknown function\r\nx(t) depends not just on the value of x(t) itself but on the value of\r\nx at certain earlier times. Such equations arise naturally in models\r\nfrom physiology and nonlinear optics. Mappings which do not increase\r\ndistance with respect to a norm on a finite dimensional vector space\r\ncome up in many contexts, e.g., scheduling problems (the so-called\r\n\"sup norm\") and nonlinear generalizations of the theory of\r\ncolumn-stochastic matrices (the so-called \"ell-one norm\"). \r\n\r\n    The principal investigator will study questions concerning certain\r\nclasses of nonlinear functional differential equations. An example of\r\ninterest is the the equation ax'(t)=f(x(t),x(t-r)), r:=r(x(t)), where\r\nf and r are given functions and one is interested in the limiting\r\n\"shape\" of periodic solutions of such equations as a approaches\r\nzero. In a different direction the principal investigator will study\r\niterates of maps which are \"nonexpansive\", i.e., do not increase\r\ndistance with respect to a given metric. If the metric is the ell-one\r\nnorm on a finite dimensional vector space, one is led to a variety of\r\ngeneralizations of the classical theory of column stochastic\r\nmatrices. The case that the metric comes from the sup norm arises in\r\nmany applications and has led to intriguing and apparently difficult\r\nconjectures concerning the maximal cardinality of a periodic orbit for\r\na map which is nonexpansive in the sup norm on a finite dimensional\r\nvector space.\r\n\r\n",
