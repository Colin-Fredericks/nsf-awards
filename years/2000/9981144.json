The project has the following specific components: development of a new type of chemistry placement exam which will identify those students who cannot solve multi-level non-algorithmic word problems; development of  a pre-calculus level mathematics course on problem solving in science; development of a new structure for the Organic Chemistry laboratory component that reinforces skills from General Chemistry and Mathematics; development of  laboratory modules on Linear Algebra and Differential Equations in Physical Chemistry; and development of one upper division elective courses on mathematical chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis project will address several important themes and areas. A more accurate placement exam coupled with a problem-solving course for those who need it will help all students to have the confidence and skills necessary to succeed in General Chemistry and to continue studying science. The mathematics and chemistry faculty will each learn more about each other's disciplines as a result of working closely together on this project, stimulating both teaching and research. The project integrates technology where appropriate into all levels of the chemistry curriculum. Its overall objectives are to provide students with the mathematical skills to succeed in chemistry and as well other sciences. It has the potential to produce models and materials that can be used nationally and have a broad national impact on science instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
