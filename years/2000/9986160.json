 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate low energy ion irradiation effects and defect interactions in near surface regions of semiconductors with the use of STM, grazing incidence x-ray diffuse scattering, and computational modeling. The objective of the project is to establish a greater understanding of defect reactions near surfaces during low-energy ion implantation. The approach is to utilize tunneling microscopy (STM), x-ray scattering (DXS) methods, and computational modeling. This combination of experimental techniques will enable observation of defects and defect structure developing at the surface as well as just below it. Computational modeling will be used to calculate the initial damage states of the surface and near-surface region for analysis of the DXS data, and as an aid in interpreting the STM data.\r\n%%%\r\nThe project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science having high potential technological relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to new understanding and capabilities in electronic devices. An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area.  \r\n***\r\n",
