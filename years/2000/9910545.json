 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Drs. Bruce Dahlin and Traci Arden will conduct three seasons of research at the archaeological site of Chunchucmil located in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. Dating to the Classic Maya period, the site is an enigma and unique among its contemporaries. Although it is extremely large with a center encompassing ca. 45 ha, it is remarkably drab and lacks the hallmarks of a major Mayan settlement. The site center lacks easily recognizable civic and public religious architecture. Missing are the obvious structures such as elaborate and conspicuous acropolises and palace complexes which would suggest administrative functions or focal temple pyramids which would serve to enhance sacred power. The site center also lacks typical Classic Mayan period sculpture, carved and inscribed stelae, altars, lintels and other trappings of traditional Mayan hierarchy. Dahlin and Arden believe that because of the site's location near the Gulf Coast (an active late prehistoric and early historic commerce route,) it may have served as a trading center with enclaves of merchants from various Mayan groups and regulated commerce both along the coast and inland. They and their collaborators have conducted preliminary mapping and survey at the site and will now follow up with a major field initiative. In addition to gathering basic temporal and spatial data, the program includes mapping and survey, midden testing, intensive excavation and paleoecological work. The central 6 km  sq. and four 10 km long cruciform transects will be mapped. The team will excavate a stratified random sampling program of residential units, specialized production areas, possible marketplaces and possible civic areas. Paleoecological work will include soil analysis and flotation of screened midden materials for macrobotanical remains, pollen and phytoliths. Laboratory analyses will include analyses of ceramics and the search for starch residues on grinding stones which will provide dietary insight.\r\n\r\nWhile considerable archaeological research has focused on individual Mayan sites and many small scale regional systems have been reconstructed, scientists do not understand the extent to which these individual units were bound together and interacted during the height of Mayan civilization. In the following Post Classic period extensive trade networks existed but none have been identified during the preceding Classic. If Dr. Dahlin's and Adren in their hypothesis that Chunchucmil was a multi-ethnic trade center, this will provide important insight into how Mayan society functioned.\r\n",
