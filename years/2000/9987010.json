 "awd_abstract_narration": "Four faculty from the targeted departments of Computer Information Systems, Engineering Technology, and Mathematics at Buffalo State College (BSC) seek a grant entitled CSEMS program from the National Science Foundation (NSF 99-121). The proposal seeks to fund two components: 1) scholarships for qualified CSEMS students, and 2) a colloquium series that will promote closer collaboration among the faculty and students of the three targeted departments while providing specialized instruction that is not usually included in the normal course work. Forty students are anticipated in the CSEMS program with a funded duration of two years. \r\n\r\nWith this NSF award, BSC students who are juniors or seniors in the targeted departments will have the opportunity to receive $1250 scholarships each semester if they are:  United States citizens, nationals, or aliens admitted as refugees at the time of the interview,  eligible for U.S. Department of Education Pell Grant,  full-time students, and  academically mature and talented.\r\n\r\n The most academically mature and talented students will be selected for the scholarships who have demonstrated many of the following professional attributes: good grades in all classes, demonstrated ability to manage time and resources, good communication skills, leadership potential, and high motivation. In keeping with the stated philosophy of the college, students may have diverse backgrounds and career goals. The student-selection process will use a numerical procedure that the Mathematics department has effectively used for years to select new faculty. This process of selecting the most qualified CSEMS students will involve an interview that results in a numerical rating from each member of the selection team. \r\n\r\nThe four faculty who developed this proposal also commit to the success of the program. After selecting the best students, the four faculty will create a monthly colloquium series for the students of the targeted departments. The colloquium series will consist of problem-solving demonstrations, not from the individual perspective of each of the targeted disciplines, but simultaneously from all three. This coordination between the three departments is expected to increase articulation between the faculty and simultaneously provide students with a better understanding and appreciation of the issues in real technical problems. Some of the presentations will contain information that will be especially beneficial to the CSEMS students. \r\n\r\nThe principal investigator (PI) will assume leadership of the CSEMS program by insuring that CSEMS recipients all have the required qualifications. The PI will also coordinate the colloquium series to insure that the program is a success. The PI will assume overall responsibility for the program administration, including the required NSF reports and the final report to be presented at a national conference. A small amount of money will be used for student infra-structure - primarily for the colloquium series. The project management and administrative expenses will be used primarily for travel - bringing guest speakers to campus and going to a national conference to present the results of the CSEMS program at Buffalo State College. The PI and Co-PIs will not receive any money for CSEMS activities. \r\n",
