 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from LASERMIND proposes to design and build an innovative scientific teaching tool that will improve high school physics students' understanding of the principles of light and energy.  The need for better understanding and knowledge of physics in secondary education in this country is paramount.  Physics teachers need a simple, safe, durable, and hands-on approach to teach students the principles of light.  The proposed learning system, Laser-Wave Explorer, will meet the needs of teachers and students.  The unique feature of this Laser-Wave Explorer system is the all-in-one design requiring no mechanical assembly.  The advanced design interlinks seven combinations of optical components together into one system.  Through inquiry-based hands-on learning, physics students can perform over 30 different laser and optical experiments with the Laser-Wave Explorer system.  LASERMIND plans to develop a teacher's guide and student workbook and to conduct field tests to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the prototype.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1996-2006 period, science and engineering jobs are expected to increase by 44 percent.  Advances in laser technology will continue to generate a demand for skilled workers.  There exists a widening workforce gap between the number of skilled scientists and engineers that will be needed and those that are available.  The Laser Wave Explorer will decrease the workforce gap by preparing physics students for future science and technology \r\n",
