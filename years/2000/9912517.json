 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThis pilot study of 15 American colleges and universities in the Fall of 1999 and early Spring of 2000 is a survey of institutional practices and dispositions toward democracy.  It parallels a similar study to be conducted by the Committee of Higher Education and Research of the Council of Europe across a range of countries and regions of stability and conflict.  The second stage of the research begins in late Spring of 2000 and involves random samples of about 125 university or college settings in both Europe and the United States.  Unless the reserarch begins this Fall, it is not possible for the United States to be a partner engaged in the design of this research.\r\n\r\n\tThe immediate goal of this comparative study is to map what is being done by universities as institutions, as well as their activities as social and political nodes in their localities, that might affect democratic political development among their students, their community, region, and country.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the data and information gathered are colleges and universities as socializaing institutions for democratic values and competencies.  The two kinds of data are:  (1) interviews with informants within the university (students, faculty, and administrators) and community leaders (government, education, media, civic associatoins, and business), and (2) an inventory of accessible data from each instituttion and localty.  Each selected university site has one researcher who conducts about 45 interviews.  The questionnaire format includes both categoric ratings and open questions probing  for university policies and actions.  The questions are evaluated for constructing cross-nationally viable scales in the second stage of the research.\r\n\r\n\tThe criterion to be used  for selecting sites is variation, covering private and public, large and small institutions, urban and rural settings, and states and regions.  In Europe, in addition to selection across regions, areas of conflict in Northern Ireland and the Balkans are targeted.\r\n\r\n\tThe budget allocates most of the money to researchers in the colleges and universities selected and to a training workshop of those researchers in Philadephia.  The Council of Europe intends an amount greater than this in addition to funds for analysis.\r\n\r\n\tIf successful, the large-scale study of samples of colleges and univerisities in Europe and the United States will be launched, with the official title, Universities as Sites of Citizenship and Civic Responsibility.  This is under the auspices of an Internaitonal Consortium composed of members from the Council of Europe Committee on Higher Education and Research and, in the United States, the American Association for Higher Education, Association of American Colleges and Universities, American Council on Education, and Campus Compact.  There is a three-person coordinating committee of the Consortium to adminster the research.  The research is part of the Council of Europe's program, Education for Democratic Citizenship. \r\n",
