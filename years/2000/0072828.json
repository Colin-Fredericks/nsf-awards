 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused on the designed construction of metal-halide open framework materials out of building blocks that are disposed toward reactivity with small molecules and/or electron transfer.  In previous work we have demonstrated the utility of a halide for oxide substitution strategy to design novel metal-halide materials patterned after known oxide and chalcogenide phases.  The present proposal will build on this success and target the complementary investigation of the synthetic design of specific structures, and the design and characterization of the reactivity of novel metal-halide materials.  Synthetic investigations will extend principles that we have developed for the construction of metal halides by investigating template/framework interactions; and by constructions with new metal-halide building blocks.  Reactivity studies will probe the reversible sorption of small molecules and electron transfer reactions, and their respective influence on framework distortion and reconstruction.  Specific efforts will include:   1. The designed templating of framework structures to understand the role of the template in framework formation and control of the construction of specific architectures;  2. The construction of novel materials with redox active templates such that framework to template charge transfer can be utilized to design magnetic, optical and electronic properties; and  3.  The synthesis of halozeotypes from tetrahedral transition-metal halides to create redox tunable frameworks with coordinative unsaturaturation at the metal centers to create \"active sites\" in a size and shape selective environment.\r\n\r\nThis is a fertile area of solid-state synthesis that is leading to promising areas of applications in materials technology's such as liquid crystals, phosphors and chemical sensors.\r\n",
