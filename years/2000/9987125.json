The principal issues to be considered during this symposium are whether the T zero temperature or the solvus temperature serves as the upper temperature limit of the massive transformation and whether the structure of massive/matrix boundaries is incoherent or partially coherent. Experimental and theoretical studies on the massive transformation in a wide range of alloy systems will be reported in both numerous metallic alloy systems as well as alumina and in bismuth oxide-based ceramics. Additionally, a central aspect in the analysis of massive growth kinetics, namely, the diffusivity in interphase boundaries, will be the subject of a set of four papers. Three of which will be experimental and concerned with measurement of the diffusivities along interphase boundaries. The fourth will be based upon computer simulations, in which attempts will be made to compare diffusivities across interphase boundaries (which cannot yet be determined independently and is instead presently evaluated from growth kinetics data) with diffusivities along the same boundaries. During the last session of the symposium, a General Discussion will be held. Financial support covers: (i) the airline travel and accommodations of a particularly important participant, Prof. Emeritus Mats Hillert (Royal Inst. of Technology, Stockholm), (ii) the expenses to be incurred in connection with the General Discussions session and (iii) partial support for attendance at the symposium by five graduate students. \r\n%%%\r\nSeveral metal alloys can undergo massive phase transformations, which affect the structure and properties of the alloy. The symposium will highlight features of this transformation and attempt to resolve several outstanding issues.  The session will be recorded, transcribed and edited by both the discussers and the symposium organizers (V. K. Vasudevan and H. I. Aaronson). Permission has been secured from Metallurgical and Materials Transactions A to publish the symposium papers and the General Discussion paper in this journal, following passage through the journal's peer review system under the supervision of the Editor, Prof. D. E. Laughlin.\r\n***\r\n",
