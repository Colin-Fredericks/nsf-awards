 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past several years there has been an advent of a host of new programming methodologies and  paradigms based on sophisticated features like concurrency and parallelism. These programming features and paradigms provide users with high levels of abstraction, enabling them to stay closer to the problem domains.  Supporting these features causes a considerable increase in the interpretation/compilation overhead, leading to complex and relatively slow implementations.  Experience in the development and implementation of programming systems based on these new paradigms shows that one of the main sources of inefficiency is the repeated specialized searches that must be performed to realize the correct semantics at run-time.  To limit inefficiency, existing languages and implementations restrict the expressiveness of the constructs.\r\nThe aim of this project is to study the search-related problems that arise in sequential and parallel implementation of advanced programming paradigms, with specific attention to logic programming and non-deterministic languages.  The specific goals of this study are: (i) to abstract the key implementation aspects of these programming frameworks as problems of design and implementation of dynamic data structures;\r\n(ii) to design efficient data structures for the resulting problems and analyze their complexity; and, (iii) to use the results from the complexity analysis to quantitatively evaluate the various implementation schemes described in the literature as well as to guide the design of efficient dynamic data structures and algorithms that will lead to optimal implementations.\r\nPrecise complexity measures  of the  solutions to these problems would allow system implementors to quantitatively compare different execution models, propose and develop optimal implementations, and talk about performance guarantees and system efficiency in a formal and mathematically precise fashion.  These results would also be of importance to the  users of these implementations, since they will allow them to understand the implementation-wise troublesome  aspects of the language and to make better use of the capabilities that the language possesses.  The results obtained in this research are expected to be directly applicable to the specific programming paradigms studied here.  Furthermore, these results are expected to be transferable to other domains like constraint management and semantic networks, where efficient specialized tree and graph searches are key components of the execution models.\r\n\r\n",
