 "awd_abstract_narration": "This application requests funds for a conference of chemosensory scientists from universities in the Intermountain Region including Utah, Idaho, and Colorado.  The conference will meet on February 9-12, 2001 at Jackson, Wyoming.  Two outside speakers using novel functional imaging techniques will be invited. The meeting will be organized around three objectives: 1) presentation of innovative experimental techniques; 2) small group \"brain storming\" sessions to focus on identifying new directions for chemosensory studies applying the techniques described in the first objective; 3) establishment of collaborative projects.\r\nThe outcome of this meeting will be to establish new strategies for recording the functional activity of chemosensory neurons.  Synthesis of cutting edge research findings from scientists studying organisms ranging from insects, cephalopods, amphibians, fish, mammals, and man will lead to exciting new advances in the field.  A small number of participants with ample time for formal presentations and informal interactions will foster new collaborations and general sharing of expertise.  Graduate students, post-docs and research associates will have full access to faculty and be encouraged to actively participate in all sessions.  Efforts will be made to actively involve women and minorities in all aspects of the meeting.\r\n\r\n",
