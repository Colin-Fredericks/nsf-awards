 "awd_abstract_narration": "0076456  \r\nMartinez-Miranda\r\n \r\nThis is an award for the acquisition of a scanning X-ray microbeam system. The system will be equipped with a X-Y scanning stage, a temperature controller, and an electromagnet.  The system will be added on to an existing Rigaku RTP360RC with a 12 kW X-ray source. This attachment will focus the X-ray beam down to a 10 x 10 micron square spot and will allow spatially dependent diffractometry with localized high flux of X-ray for characterizing combinatorial libraries and composition-spread samples, as well as confined samples of organic and inorganic macromolecules. Work performed with the instrumentation requested will complement and expand already existing efforts in the study of composition-spread samples, nanometer structured materials and spatially confined materials at the University of Maryland College Park. The instrument will provide new and much needed capability at the institution. It enables one to obtain spatially dependent structural information and distribution of various materials phases within individual samples. It is particularly instrumental in investigating formation of various compositional phases at different sites on combinatorial libraries and mapping the structural changes and phase distribution across composition-spread samples. Students with diverse background and origin will benefit from research program based on this equipment.\r\n***\r\n",
