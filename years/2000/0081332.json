The quantum mechanical bits in this design consist of the electric dipole moments of diatomic molecules, which may be oriented either along or against an external electric field.  Coupling between bits for logical operations is established because the electric field created by each dipole influences the energy of its neighbors.  The molecular dipoles are trapped in a linear array formed by a standing-wave laser beam.  It is estimated that this design can lead to a quantum computer with 10,000 qubits, which can perform 100,000 processor steps in the 1-10 seconds before decoherence.\r\n\r\nThis project will address two aspects of the development of this approach: a source of ultracold molecules, and demonstration of the couplings between polarized molecules.  The first stage of the work will be development of the source of molecules by simultaneously collecting Rb and Cs atoms in a magneto-optic trap, then photoassociating them to form ultracold RbCs molecules.  The second stage will demonstrate the possiblilty of coupling between molecules by measurement of molecular electric resonance frequencies as a function of density and applied electric field.  Once the effect has been observed the project will turn to the construction of an optical trap for the quantum computer.  Demonstrations of most of the technical elements necessary for the quantum computer will be possible within the period of this project.\r\n",
