 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the preparation of NeuAc homooligomers and NeuAc/alpha-amino acid conjugates to form compounds with unique secondary structures.  Amide-linked oligomers will be conjugated with biotin for biological screening and to polymerizable lipids for protein screening.  Oligomers will be conjugated to form tertiary structures or coiled coils.  Circular dichroism and inverse detected nuclear magnetic resonance techniques will be used to elucidate structure of the resulting polysialoamides.\r\n\r\nWith this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Jacquelyn Gervay-Hague of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Arizona.  Professor Gervay-Hague will focus her work on the synthesis and characterization of new carbohydrate-based materials with stable secondary structures in aqueous solution.  This is the first step toward engineering artificial proteins.  These materials have potential impact for use in drug delivery, as biosensors, as affinity materials and as chemical catalysts.   Further, the project provides a diverse and multidimensional training environment for human resource development.",
