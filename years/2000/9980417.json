The goal of this Educational Materials Development project is to design an advanced database course based upon the latest database technologies and to develop the supporting educational materials. The objective is to cover the fundamental theory and to provide integrated, cooperative group projects to emphasize the practical application of these concepts. Since database professionals interact with users and are likely to be exposed to sensitive information, the project is also exploring the effective integration of professionalism and ethics within the curriculum. \r\n\r\nThe expected outcomes include a set of modules, one for each topic, where a module includes class notes, active in-class exercises, cooperative group projects and outcome-based assessment.  The evaluation includes 1) detailed student evaluations including student performance data, 2) industry participation through an advisory committee, and 3) alumni feedback during the three years after students graduate.  In the final year of the project, the course will be tested at additional sites to assess the use of the materials across diverse student populations.  The external sites will also complete an evaluation of the effectiveness of the course and materials for their student populations.  Dissemination is being accomplished through professional journals and conferences, a web site with a mailing list of users, a faculty de\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
