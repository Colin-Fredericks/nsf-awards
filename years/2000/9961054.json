 "awd_abstract_narration": "9961054\r\nSmith\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel electro-mechanical, micro-vibratory transducer that can be used to detect and control boundary layer flow separation in a wide class of aerodynamic flows.  This transducer is composed of a very thin, light-weight composite sheet that contains the combination sensors and vibratory transducers that are used to detect boundary layer flow conditions and to excite the viscous sub-layer of the boundary layer to control flow separation.  The power consumption of the transducer is expected to be about three orders of magnitude lower than the best competing technologies.  The device will be easily applied to or integrated into stationary and high-speed rotating machinery and components such as aircraft wings and control surfaces, aircraft propellers, helicopter rotors, axial compressor blades, diffusers, and nozzles.  Phase I will address wide needs for flow control in high-Reynolds Number flows. \r\n\r\nThe performance enhancement and increased efficiency of such an advanced boundary layer control device can provide a competitive edge in many industries.  This technology can potentially be applied to a broad range of aviation needs including drag reduction, lift augmentation, and boosting of flight controls in airplanes and similar applications in helicopters.  Applications of the technology in the automotive field and in the process industry will also be pursued.\r\n\r\n",
