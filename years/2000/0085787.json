 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is part of a collaboration that is building a broad and deep collection of educational resources for Earth system education as part of the Digital Library for Earth Systems Education (DLESE) project. First, existing resources pertaining to Earth system education are being collected into a broad \"works in progress\" collection. Second, metadata are associated with each resource, to facilitate discovery by end users. Third, a \"community review\" system is being created to evaluate resources for pedagogical effectiveness, ease of use for faculty and students, and power to motivate and inspire students. This step enables identification of the best of the collected resources, which are then placed in a smaller high-quality \"reviewed\" area. Finally, assessment of both the reviewed and unreviewed collections is taking place, to ensure they are well-balanced and meet the needs of the user community. Partners in the collaboration are the American Geological Institute, Columbia University, Dartmouth College, and Foothill-DeAnza Community College. This project has responsibility for the metatagging component.",
