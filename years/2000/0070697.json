 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nA basic problem in several complex variables is to understand\r\nthe interplay between the analytic and geometric natures of a domain.\r\nThe principal investigator plans to address this problem by \r\nstudying the d-bar-Neumann problem, invariant metrics, and \r\nautomorphism groups. More specifically, the principal investigator plans\r\nto  study compactness and eigenvalue spectrum of the d-bar-Neumann operator.\r\nHe will investigate necessary and sufficient conditions for \r\ncompactness of the d-bar-Neumann problem in geometric and potential\r\ntheoretic terms.  He will also study eigenvalue spectrum of the\r\nd-bar-Neumann problem by investigating, among other problems, \r\nthe several complex variables analog of Mark Kac's question: ``Can one \r\nhear the shape of a drum?''.  In addition, the principal investigator\r\nplans to study invariant metrics, in particularly, the Bergman and\r\nKobayashi metrics. He will consider boundary behavior and the zero set of\r\nthe Bergman kernel function, as well as completeness of the Kobayashi\r\nmetric.  Another problem to be studied is the theory of automorphism\r\ngroups and its relationship with the regularity of the d-bar-Neumann\r\nproblem. \r\n\r\nComplex analysis is a key tool in many areas of sciences and engineering.\r\nFor example, the Laplace transform is essential in the study of \r\nmechanical vibrations and electric circuits.  The Laplace equation \r\nhas important applications to hydrodynamics, electrostatics, \r\nand heat conduction.  The problems under investigation in this project \r\nare not only intrinsically interesting, but also have implications in \r\nareas such as complex geometry, operator theory,  potential theory,\r\nmathematical physics, and quantum mechanics.  Many tools to be used in\r\nthis project come from other branches of mathematics and sciences.  Some\r\nproblems may even rely on computer programming. The investigator will\r\nalso contribute to the development of human resources by supervising a\r\ngraduate student.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
