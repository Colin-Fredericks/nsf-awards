 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general goals of the proposed research are to optimize a novel new genetic transformation technique.  A model organism the evolutionarily ancient and commercially valuable, edible red seaweed Porphyra, commonly known as nori has been selected for experimentation.  The specific goals of this SGER are:  1) to test an homologous promoter for stable gene expression of GUS and GFP reporter genes, and 2) to test and evaluate a number of genes for antibiotic resistance as selectable markers.\r\n\r\nOver the past decade, genetic transformation techniques have made immeasurable contributions to agriculture and to an understanding of gene structure and function in land plants.  By comparison, the application of genetic transformation techniques to marine plants is in its infancy.  Despite the considerable commercial value of seaweed aquaculture, to date only a handful of unicellular marine algae and not a single macroscopic marine alga (or seaweed) have been transformed successfully.  The development of a genetic transformation procedure that is broadly applicable to marine algae would be extremely beneficial for developing new commercial uses for marine algae, as well as for furthering investigations of their molecular biology and biochemistry.",
