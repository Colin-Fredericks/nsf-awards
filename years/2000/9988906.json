 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physical prototyping has gained popularity with the help of a concept called \"layered manufacturing\" or\"solid free form fabrication\" (SFF). The main benefits from SFF are mostly derived from its ability to create physical models regardless of shape complexity.  However, the majority of SFF processes available to the community today, produce \"touch and feel\" parts rather than 'functional' components that can be used for engineering applications.  Although many novel parts can be made from these processes, residual stresses and anisotropy of material properties limit the applicability of current practices. Residual stresses, a characteristic feature of components made in a layerwise fashion, can cause distortion, warping, and delamination.  In response to these problems researchers from Stanford and the University of California-Davis are jointly exploring methods to (1) reduce residual stress levels during layered deposition of metallic and non-metallic materials and to (2) produce parts with enhanced microstructures with high mechanical strength and good wear resistance by optimizing the deposition patterns and synthesizing new composite materials. \r\n\r\nThe following results are anticipated from the present research:   The development of a deeper understanding of the relationship of compositional constituents and process variables upon material properties and material deposition characteristics.  The synthesis of material composites with low coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) matrix and enhanced material properties.   The development of material deposition strategies which minimize thermal gradients and optimize microstructural morphology.   The integration of modeling and processing efforts to improve part decomposition and layering strategies for optimal part design and fabrication.   \r\n\r\n",
