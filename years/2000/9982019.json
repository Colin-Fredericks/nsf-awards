 "awd_abstract_narration": "Humans can very accurately follow moving visual targets using smooth pursuit eye movements. The objective of the proposed research is to gain a better understanding of the contribution of attention to this process. A new dual-task paradigm has been developed for this purpose. Subjects will be asked to follow a moving visual target with smooth pursuit eye movements while reacting to the appearance of a second peripheral target by pressing a button. Any systematic variations in the latency of the button pressing will be inferred to be due to alterations in the allocation of attention around the pursuit stimulus. By varying the timing of appearance, location, and eccentricity of the peripheral target relative to the pursuit stimulus it will be possible to examine how attention is distributed during pursuit responses. In addition, by changing the speed of the pursuit stimulus itself within this dual-task paradigm it will be possible to assess how attentional allocation changes as a function of the characteristics of the target being pursued. Finally, by manipulating where subjects direct their attention by the use of precues it will be possible to assess how perturbing the normal spatial allocation of attention influences smooth pursuit output. The overall results should provide a better understanding of how attention and smooth pursuit eye movements interact. This could prove useful in the design of systems and training of persons for situations in which smooth pursuit responses are typically elicited (e.g. pilots, assembly line workers). In addition, the paradigm itself could be used to understand in more detail the relationship between attentional deficits and declines in smooth pursuit output in schizophrenic individuals and children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
