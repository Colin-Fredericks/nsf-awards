 "awd_abstract_narration": "A scientifically and technologically important class of\r\ncomposite materials are those which exhibit a sharp transition in their\r\nmaterial and microstructural properties as some parameter is\r\nvaried near a critical point. One example with extremely rich\r\nbehavior is an electrorheological (ER) fluid, which is a \r\ncolloidal suspension of polarizable particles of high complex\r\ndielectric constant, with typical sizes ranging from micron to\r\nmillimeter scales, in a viscous fluid of low complex dielectric\r\nconstant such as oil. The application of a strong electric field \r\nto such a suspension produces within milliseconds a dramatic\r\ntransition from an oily slurry to a solid-like state with an\r\nincrease in the viscosity of the suspension by many orders of\r\nmagnitude. For non-conducting dielectric spheres, the transition \r\nis characterized by the formation of chains which aggregate into\r\ncolumns parallel to the field. For metal spheres, net-like\r\nstructures with fractal characteristics form. Recently the\r\ninvestigator has introduced a way of applying the methods of\r\nstatistical mechanics to macroscopic problems in composite\r\nmedia, for length scales much larger than the in the traditional\r\ndomain of statistical mechanics. In the research supported by this \r\naward, the investigator will develop these methods further and begin\r\napplying them to study the critical properties of ER fluids,\r\nparticularly those with larger spheres where thermal effects\r\nare negligible, and classical application of statistical\r\nmechanics yields little information.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaterials such as electrorheological (ER) fluids which exhibit \r\nsome type of marked transitional behavior appear throughout \r\nscience and engineering, and are important in many technological \r\napplications. Other examples include sea ice, porous media \r\nsuch as sandstones and soils, particulate composites used in\r\nsmart devices and in conducting films for electromagnetic \r\napplications, and material failure due to fracture. The fluid/solid \r\ntransition in ER fluids is a particularly interesting example of the \r\ntype of critical behavior exhibited by these materials. The potential for rapid\r\nelectrical control of rheological properties has attracted\r\nconsiderable attention to ER fluids, with applications including\r\nclutches, pumps, brakes and shock absorbers. From a theoretical\r\nstandpoint, however, there remains much to be understood about \r\nthe material behavior and properties near the transition. In the\r\nproposed work the investigator will develop mathematical methods\r\nfor understanding the transition in ER fluids, as well as other\r\ncomposite materials exhibiting critical behavior.\r\n",
