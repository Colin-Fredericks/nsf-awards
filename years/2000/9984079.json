 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on understanding, modeling, and supporting human decision making in complex\r\nsituations such as manufacturing, aviation, process control, military and non-military command and\r\ncontrol and transportation. These situations are challenging, and can lead to potential problems and\r\nhuman errors, because they are often rapidly changing, have uncertain and risky elements, and require\r\nquick responses. To study these,issues, the project includes the development of interactive computer\r\nsimulations to allow experiments in which participants will make decisions in complex environments\r\nsuch as process control or transportation. Planned experiments include investigating how people cope\r\nwith uncertain information when making decisions, identifying appropriate types of performance\r\ninformation which may help people learn to make better decisions, and developing display formats and\r\nvisualizations to help people better understand uncertainty and how it may affect their decisions.\r\nResearch results will be relevant for the development of computer displays, decision-aids, and\r\ntraining recommendations which can lead to improved decision-making performance. The project includes\r\neducational components which are integrated with the research plan through the utilization of the\r\nexperimental simulations in course exercises and projects, through undergraduate and graduate student\r\ninvolvement in the ongoing research, and through the incorporation of research results into course\r\nmaterials.\r\n",
