The college is focusing on low-income, first time students who are not necessarily college directed or oriented but who have the talent to succeed in technical programs based in computer science and engineering technologies. The project is providing the opportunity for financial assistance to students in the West Texas region, an area marked by vast distances between metropolitan areas, and a large percentage of economically disadvantaged students. The program combines scholarship assistance with student services designed to promote (1) success in college, (2) success in obtaining employment commensurate with their education, and (3) success in the workplace. \r\n\r\nThe Technology Tomorrow Scholarship Program objectives are: \r\n1. To increase the number of students enrolling in technical programs in the computer science and engineering technologies by 5%. 2. To increase the number of women and minorities enrolling in technical programs in the computer science and engineering technologies by 3%. 3. To provide financial assistance to financially needy students with the ability and drive to succeed in the computer science and engineering technologies. 4. To retain at least 75% of students awarded NSF scholarship to graduation. \r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigator has extensive experience both as an instructor and as an administrator. His experience coordinating grant programs, including services to economically disadvantaged students, and his role as Director of Institutional Planning and Research and Associate Dean of Instruction give him the experience to plan, administer and report on this project. A team of Program Chairs in the programs designated for the project, Financial Aid Advisors and Admissions Advisors join with the PI to identify and select scholarship recipients. The Financial Aid and Business Offices provide current information on the recipients and on the disbursement of funds for regular reports to the National Science Foundation. \r\n\r\nThe college is coordinating financial aid such as the Pell Grant and additional scholarships from industry, civic organizations and individuals with the TT/NSF scholarship program to optimize the number of students who are receiving scholarships. The project is evaluated by team members and reviewed by the PI on a biweekly basis to determine whether scholarship students are progressing as expected. Information on the scholarship program is disseminated in print, in workshops and through the college web site. The college anticipates that over two years at least 33 students will be awarded scholarships using grant funds in the total amount of $125,000.\r\n \r\n",
