 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics  (13)  The project is adapting and implementing a microcomputer-based laboratory (MBL) for introductory-level physics courses. The objective is to provide a wide range of students access to and experience with hands-on activities incorporating conceptual and quantitative elements with real-time data collection. The implementation of existing tools such as Real-Time Physics will occur with the development of additional enhancements, particularly web-based resources such as pre-lab assignments and interactive learning evaluation tools.\r\n\r\nThe program exists as the second element in a planned three-stage enhancement for physics education at Boston University. The first stage is the development and application of Interactive Lecture Demonstrations in the classroom. This has been funded by the University and is nearly complete. The second stage is the MBL for the introductory courses. The third stage will be the development of a more advanced microcomputer-based lab in the intermediate and advanced physics classes, thereby integrating the MBL experience vertically through the curriculum.\r\n\r\nThe introductory MBL program consists of a set of 13 computers and workbench tools for the introductory physics classes, covering conceptual physics, mechanics, electricity and magnetism, and modem physics. The project is also enhancing existing educational tools with web-based resources providing greater breadth and depth to the individual experiments; on-line evaluations to provide rapid student response and a convenient basis for assessment, and using the new Interactive Lecture Demonstrations as a complementary student learning activity. Boston University is renovating a room in the central foyer of the Metcalf Science and Engineering building specifically for the implementation of this program and for maximum visibility to the greater student population.\r\n",
