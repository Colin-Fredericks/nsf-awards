The US organizer is Dr. Samy El-Shall, Professor of Chemistry, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia.  The Egyptian co-organizer is Dr. Sherif Eissa, President of the National Research Center in Cairo.  The purposes of the workshop are to discuss jointly selected important topics in materials sciences and to identify specific areas where research collaboration will be mutually beneficial.  Individual workshop sessions will be dedicated to: nanostructured and nanocomposite materials, smart materials and self-assembly, thin films, and high performance materials (magnetic, photonics, molecular electronics). The final session of the workshop will be devoted to discussions of conclusions and future plans.  The proceedings will highlight areas recommended for collaborative research.\r\n \r\nScope:  This award will support a US-Egypt workshop in an area that is increasing in importance both in the United States and in Egypt.  The development of suitable materials for various applications is crucial for developments in industry, environmental management, housing, and in health service delivery.  The workshop participants will not only assess the current status of the field of advanced materials, but also will discuss cooperative research and joint projects between American and Egyptian scientists and engineers, and will discuss the technological and economic impacts of these projects.  Participants from both countries represent academia, government, and the private sector. The Egyptian coorganizer is the president of the primary government research organization in that country.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting US-foreign scientific collaboration in areas of mutual benefit.  Funding for this project is provided by the Division of International Programs, through the US-Egypt Joint Fund program, and by the Division of Materials Research.",
