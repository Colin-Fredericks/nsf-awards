 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to enhance the resolution and sensitivity of\r\nmass spectrometers by two or three orders of magnitude. A secondary goal is to reduce power consumption. Combined, these goals will lead to the development of a portable\r\nmass spectrometer with greater sensitivity than current, large mass spectrometers. This\r\nwill allow the quantitative analysis of low concentration compounds with little or no\r\nsample preparation. This mass spectrometer could be widely used for environmental\r\nassessment and for many other applications.\r\n\r\nThree innovations will accomplish these goals. The first is the use of a cascading\r\nDC/RF and RF-only quadrupole mass filter. This new filter will give excellent mass\r\nresolution. It is also much less sensitive to mechanical tolerances, so small filters can be\r\nbuilt, and this leads to a large reduction in electrical power requirements.\r\n\r\nThe second innovation is the use of an integrated Faraday cup/VLSI amplifier\r\ndetector. Unconventional CMOS design leads to a single stage dc current gains of\r\n100,000,000. Using extremely low biasing currents, differential and narrow frequency\r\nban operation will result also in significant improvement of the signal to noise ratio. This\r\ndetector will detect ion currents 1,000 times smaller than the conventional electron\r\nmultiplier detectors, and the performance of the VLSI detector should be much more\r\nstable.\r\n\r\nThe third innovation is the addition of AC modulation to the detector circuitry.\r\nThis eliminates noise due to DC drift, thereby greatly improving the signal-to-noise ratio.\r\nResults of this research may give the University of Wyoming a competitive edge\r\nfor obtaining additional funding for future research. Several government agencies may be\r\ninterested in expanding our results. Results of the proposed research may also generate a\r\nsignificant interest in the private sector. Several branches of our economy may be\r\ninterested in portable mass spectrometers including the pharmaceutical industry, the\r\nenvironmental remediation industry, the semiconductor industry, the petroleum industry,\r\nand the mining industry.\r\n",
