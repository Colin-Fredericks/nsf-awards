Much of the film will be shot at Goodall's principal research site, Gombe National Park in Tanzania and will focus primarily on the chimpanzees she has studied.   While reviewing the four decades of Dr. Goodall's research with the chimpanzees, the film also will explore the work of Elizabeth Vinson, a young researcher who is continuing Dr. Goodall's research.  Vinson is the first person at Gombe to quantify measures of individual chip difference in tool using skill and techniques and to examine how social dynamics affect the development of this behavior in young chimps.  Featuring Vinson's work contributes to the film in a number of ways.  It connects Goodall's milestone observation of non-human animal use of tools to a real, contemporary and substantive field project.  It also will enable the filmmakers to tell the story of a new generation of researcher.  The film and the accompanying educational materials will convey substantive science and stress the importance of long-term scientific field studies.  \r\n\r\nAn array of educational materials and programs will be created to support and build on the learning experience from the film.  These include:\r\n\r\nFreestanding kiosk exhibits for display at museums that lease the film.  These small exhibits will highlight real artifacts and specimens, including chimp tools and field notes from Dr. Goodall's work.  Technology at the kiosks will feature video sequences of chimp behavior and enable visitors to access the project's online activities.\r\n\r\nA \"Discovering Chimps\" website will enable users to meet the chimps, take a Gombe virtual tour, learn about Gombe researchers and to find related resources - both on and offline.\r\n\r\nAn educator leadership institute will be a help prior to the release of the film to train educators from twenty museums how to make the most effective use of the film and outreach material.\r\n\r\nWomen-in-Science classes for children and parents will be designed and offered by both the Science Museum of Minnesota and Discovery Place in Charlotte, NC.  The design of these classes will be available to other museums that lease the film.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
