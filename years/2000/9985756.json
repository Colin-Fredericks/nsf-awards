 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many cell movements depend on dynamic interactions between the\r\nextracellular matrix and focal adhesion protein complexes, which anchor\r\nthe intracellular cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix.  The proposal\r\nis to study the regulatory role of focal adhesion kinase or FAK in the\r\nmorphogenesis of the translucent sea urchin embryo. \r\n\r\n     (1) The initial goal is to determine in which cells and types of cell\r\nmovements FAK found.  Confocal microscopy will allow three-dimension\r\nreconstruction of the embryos.  Preliminary studies show that FAK is found\r\nin the thickening vegetal plate of blastula embryos, in primary mesenchyme\r\ncells migrating in the blastocoel, in secondary mesenchyme cells\r\nresponsible for fusion of the archenteron with the oral plate, and in the\r\nthickening animal pole from which the pluteus arms extend. \r\n\r\n     (2) The second goal will be to determine the functional role of FAK by\r\nmicroinjecting into embryos a construct of FAK that contains only the\r\ntargeting domain.  The hypothesis is that this domain will compete with\r\nendogenous FAK and result in abnormal gastrulation by slowing or aborting\r\nthe normal movements of cells.\r\n\r\n     (3) Sea urchin embryos have at least three isoforms of FAK. The goal is to\r\ndetermine whether these isoforms of FAK are differentially expressed in\r\nsea urchin embryos and when each is expressed.  This information could be\r\nsignificant since multiple isoforms of FAK have also been isolated from\r\nXenopus and mouse embryos, but the function of the various isoforms is not\r\nknown. \r\n\r\n     (4) The last goal is to determine how focal adhesion complexes dynamically\r\nchange in embryos. mRNAs and cDNAs of FAK-green fluorescent protein\r\nconstructs will be injected into eggs to watch the dynamics of focal\r\nadhesion formation in motile cells of the embryos.  These observations\r\nwill be done with confocal microscopy in real time. \r\n\r\n     Significance: Although the roles of focal adhesions during the migration\r\nof embryonic fibroblast cells in culture are being extensively studied,\r\nlittle has been published on the roles of focal adhesions during\r\nembryogenesis and none in living embryos.  This proposal introduces new\r\ntechnology to address fundamental mechanisms of cell movements in embryos\r\nthat have not been studied in such a dynamic and complex system.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
