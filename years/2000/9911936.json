This Teacher Enhancement project creates school mathematics leadership teams in 30 high schools and 30 middle schools to support implementation of high quality, comprehensive mathematics instructional materials.  Each school-based leadership team consists of the principal/administrator, a parent, a guidance counselor, the mathematics department chair (if the position exists) and mathematics teacher leaders.  Each of the 210 teacher leaders in RMMLC participates in 210 - 462 hours of professional development over the life of the project.  In addition, the project provides 140- 252 hours of professional development to another 110 mathematics teachers/colleagues in project schools.  \r\n\r\nThe summer professional development activities are comprised of a two-day Leadership Summit and a one-week Leadership Academy.  During the school year, school leadership teams meet monthly at the building site and attend fall and spring Summit meetings.  Teacher leaders also participate in four additional days of leadership development.  An institute provides RMMLC high school participants the professional development necessary to expand their understanding of mathematical content, curriculum, pedagogy and assessment using the Interactive Mathematics Program materials.  \r\n\r\nProject evaluation includes student, teacher and leadership components.  Growth in participating teachers' knowledge of mathematical content and standards is assessed.  Student learning is assessed in Colorado using statewide and school-specific proficiency levels of the Colorado State Assessment Program's Mathematics Assessments during the three years of the project.  \r\n\r\nRMMLC extends and draws on the experiences of two NSF-funded Teacher Enhancement projects in the Rocky Mountain region:  TEAM 2000 (a secondary mathematics project, which expires in FY 2000) and COMMSTEP (a middle grades mathematics Local Systemic Change project). \r\n",
