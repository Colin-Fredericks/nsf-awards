This method yields high spatial resolution data for observers at Earth and therefore allows long time baseline observations of the rings. Some occultations occur near a planet's stationary point, when the planet's apparent motion on the sky-plane approaches zero. By virtue of their slow velocity, these events can yield higher signal-to-noise data. One such event for Uranus occurred in 1987; the occultation of the star U36 took place over 4 days with sky-plane velocities between 0.3 and 1.5 km/sec.  Dr.  Amanda Bosh will utilize these unusual data to search for small-amplitude distortions on ring edges that are detectable only with slow-velocity earth-based data or in situ imaging or stellar occultations.  She will analyze the occultation data by modeling occultation light curves as diffraction profiles of semi-opaque square wells. She will also employ occultation geometry and ring kinematics modeling techniques that have been successfully used for investigations of Saturn's ring structure. The ring-edge distortions, if identified, may aid in refining global kinematic models for the Uranian rings. In addition, through analysis of the wavelength and amplitude of the distortion, one can\r\ninfer the existence of one or more nearby shepherding satellites. Both improved kinematics and satellite detection are waypoints toward better understanding of the confinement mechanisms for narrow rings.  This award is made through the Planetary Astronomy Program.\r\n***\r\n",
