 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to integrate Si-based tunnel diodes with CMOS and SiGe HBT\r\ntechnology to demonstrate circuits which exhibit higher circuit speed, reduced\r\ncomponent count, and lowered power consumption, and which extend CMOS on the\r\nSemiconductor Industry Association (SIA) Roadmap without a linewidth reduction.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project would establish an integrated program by involving universities\r\n(Delaware and Rochester Institute of Technology) and government research laboratories\r\n(Naval Research Laboratory) with the goal of making the first Si-based tunnel diode\r\nintegrated circuit. The research will focus on simple tunnel diode circuits which combine\r\nSi-based tunnel diodes with CMOS and SiGe HBT technology. The work will be\r\nsynergistic with another project (NSF-ITR) involving Michigan, Delaware, NRL and RIT\r\nwhich proposes to study the new circuits enabled by this technology.\r\n\r\nThis proposed project focuses upon developing integration recipes with CMOS and\r\nHBTs. This body of work includes: studying the back-end thermal budget for\r\nunmetalized CMOS to withstand tunnel diode processing; finding appropriate cleaning\r\netchants which prepare the surface for MBE overgrowth while being benign to the pre-existing\r\nCMOS; develop selective etchants to remove unwanted poly-crystalline MBE\r\ngrowth atop the CMOS; perform MBE overgrowth into pre-defined windows atop\r\nsource/drain implants; examine possible emitter/base junction displacement with tunnel\r\ndiode overgrowth; develop selective etchants to mesa etch the TD atop the HBT\r\nstructure; and realize some simple tunnel diode transistor circuits. The Si-based tunnel\r\ndiodes have already been developed (NSF CAREER- Berger, DARPA- Ultra\r\nElectronics) and are currently being optimized (NSF GOALI-Berger, NRL and\r\nRaytheon). SiGe HBT integration will be performed by Delaware and by the NRL team,\r\nwho have considerable experience in the growth and fabrication of SiGe HBTs. For this\r\nproposed project, Dr. Phillip Thompson at NRL will perform the MBE growths,\r\nDelaware will perform tunnel diode and SiGe HBT fabrication and testing, and RIT will\r\nperform the CMOS fabrication.\r\n\r\nStrong interaction between the University of Delaware, the Naval Research Laboratory\r\nand Rochester Institute of Technology will foster open discussion and dialogue. This\r\nproposal seeks to bring together circuit designers, semiconductor device engineers and\r\nCMOS technologists for the sole purpose of realizing tunnel diode/transistor circuits on a\r\nSi platform. Undergraduate research and student training will play a significant role at\r\nDelaware through existing and anticipated NSF REU supplements and at RIT through\r\ntheir student-run CMOS factory and RIT's senior thesis projects. RIT's budget includes\r\nan undergraduate researcher. The cross-disciplinary work and site visits to NRL research\r\nlabs will enhance the educational process.",
