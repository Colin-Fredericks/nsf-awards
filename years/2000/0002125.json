US PI Rajendra Singh, Clemson University and Indian collaborator, Samares Kar, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur will conduct basic research on metal-oxide silicon field-effect transistors (MOSFETs).  Their study will focus on two-gate dielectric materials, one of the most important issues facing ultrathin gate dielectrics.  The results are expected to add to our understanding of the reliability of ultrathin gate dielectrics and to be useful in developing the technology for future generations of MOSFETs and integrated circuits.\r\n\r\nScope:  This research is highly relevant to the continued advancement of silicon Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits technology.  It should contribute advanced knowledge in the fabrication of ultrathin gate insulator films for nanoscale MOSFETs.  Additionally, it supports the aim of the US VLSI industry, which is to produce complex circuits with nanoscale device features by 2010.  The PIs are active contributors to journals, conferences and workshops, so the results of their work should receive broad attention.  This effort will enhance collaboration between US and Indian scientists and support a linkage with one of India's premier institutes of technology.          \r\n",
