 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organic compounds play an important role in numerous chemical, physical, and biological processes during circulation of seawater-derived hydrothermal fluids through the crust at mid-ocean ridges. Despite their importance, the abundance and composition of aqueous organic species in hydrothermal fluids from sedimented and unsedimented axial hot-spring systems are presently unknown. During this study, hydrothermal fluids will be sampled at the Endeavour and Middle Valley hydrothermal fields, northern Juan de Fuca ridge using a newly designed gas-tight fluid sampler and the submersible Alvin. The new sampler allows the abundance of both volatile and non-volatile aqueous species to be determined quantitatively in a single fluid sample. Fluids will be analyzed quantitatively for a broad spectrum of aqueous organic and inorganic species to fully characterize subsurface chemical environments and  constrain the extent of organic-inorganic chemical interaction. The results will lead to an increased understanding of factors that regulate the generation and destruction of organic species in hydrothermal systems and allow evaluation of a broad spectrum of biogeochemical processes such as crustal alteration, mobilization of ore-forming metals, the flux of carbon from the oceanic crust to the water column, the availability of nutrients to support a subsurface biosphere,  and the abiotic synthesis of organic compounds that may represent precursors to life.\r\n",
