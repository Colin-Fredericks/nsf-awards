 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\n\r\nThis adaptation and implementation project addresses the following key problems facing earth science education:  1) geological and cultural features buried in the subsurface provide the bulk of geologic investigations, whether in mineral exploration, environmental remediation, engineering or anthropology; 2) many states are adopting more rigorous teaching standards for science teachers, with an emphasis on hands-on learning; and 3) new National Science Education Standards encourage active student participation in their learning experience.  It adapts equipment and data-gathering techniques used by industry for classroom use within the context of a hands-on, inquiry based pedagogical approach. \r\n\r\nThis project sets up a geophysics/environmental sciences field-mapping laboratory that includes a ground penetrating radar system (GPR)  and reflection/ refraction software.  A GPR provides rapid acquisition of shallow subsurface images of strata, geological structures, and cultural features necessary for geological, hydrological, environmental, engineering, and anthropological studies.  It is easy to learn to use and is lightweight and portable, thus making it ideally suited for student handling and use in the field.  \r\n\r\nSpecific activities include modifying existing undergraduate and graduate courses to incorporate GPR,  establishing a summer field program incorporating geophysical techniques, creating a summer workshop in earth science laboratory and field techniques for K-12 teachers, and sharing the GPR with other colleges and universities in the local area.  This equipment is being made available to the diverse student and teacher population found in the local area.  Evaluation is being conducted by an external evaluator to assess the effectiveness of the curriculum changes, the use of the laboratory equipment, and the teacher training effort.  Dissemination is being accomplished by conference presentations, teacher workshops, and an active website containing both materials and student projects. \r\n  \r\n\r\n",
