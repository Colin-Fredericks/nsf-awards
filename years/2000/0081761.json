 "awd_abstract_narration": "EIA-0081761\r\nZhao, Wei\r\nTexas Engineering Experiment Station\r\n\r\nITR: On a Virtual Laboratory for Network Engineering Educational Programs\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this proposed research is to investigate issues\r\ninvolved in building a virtual laboratory for network engineering\r\neducational programs.  Different from a conventional teaching laboratory,\r\nthe proposed virtual laboratory will not require students to physically\r\npresent in the laboratory rooms, rather they conduct their experiments via\r\nremote network connections, such as the World Wide Web.  The intent is to\r\ndemonstrate that this kind of virtual laboratory facilitates the training\r\nof IT workers in a significant way: it will reduce the cost, increase the\r\nfacility utilization, and improve the quality of IT courses that are\r\nexperiment-oriented.  This project will focus on addressing technical\r\nchallenges that are critical for successful implementation and operation of\r\nsuch a virtual laboratory.  Configuration and scheduling techniques will be\r\nstudied that provide students with remote but real time access to the\r\nequipment during their experiments.  These kinds of configurations must be\r\ncarried out in an efficient and flexible manner so that a large number of\r\nstudents can do their experiments simultaneously.  Access control methods\r\nwill also be investigated that deal with the degree of control over network\r\ncomponents given to the user.  The efficacy of diverse access control\r\nmethods will be examined over a range of implemented exercises.  The aim is\r\nto build a virtual laboratory that allows an instructor to choose the\r\ninterplay of operating system support, experiment semantics, and network\r\nsupport to best suit the learning environment.\r\n",
