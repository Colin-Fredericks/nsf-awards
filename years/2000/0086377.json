The field of axon guidance and developmental plasticity have emerged as one of the most exciting and rapidly growing areas in Neuroscience and during the last 5 years exceptional progress has been made in guidance molecules and their receptors.  This meeting will assemble many of the leaders of the field to discuss leading edge developments in the field and the impact of recent advances in genomics.  In addition, efforts have been made to include graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty in the program, in large part via afternoon poster sessions.  It is expected that this will be a biennial event and the first meeting in 1998 was considered to be highly successful.  There is a clear organizational plan and detailed list of distinguished speakers.  There has also been a clear effort made to recruit applications from underrepresented minorities and women have a significant presence on the program, including session chairs.",
