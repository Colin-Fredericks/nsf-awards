 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract Butera\r\n\r\nThe \"dynamic-clamp\" is an electrophysiological technique developed in the\r\npast decade that utilizes real-time voltage-measurements from electrically\r\nexcitable cells, such as neurons and cardiac myocytes.  These measurements\r\nare used by a computational model running in real-time to compute artificial\r\nionic currents that are injected into (the same or another) excitable cells. \r\nApplications of this technique include augmenting the intrinsic electrical\r\nproperties of a single cell or using the computer to connect isolated cells\r\nto create an artificial network consisting of real neurons and computed\r\nsynapses.  This approach has seen growing use in the neuroscience and\r\ncardiac electrophysiology communities.  However, the technique is nontrivial\r\nto implement and off-the-shelf (turnkey) approaches have not kept pace with\r\nrapidly changing computing technologies.  Furthermore, although many\r\nlaboratories have used this technique, little research has been done to\r\nevaulate its accuracy and validity.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this application is to develop a next-generation system\r\nthat implements the dynamic-clamp tecnique and utilizes currently avaiable\r\ncomputing technologies.  This technique will be low-cost, using computers\r\nand electrophysiolgical hardware available in most neurophysiological\r\nlaboratories; fully-featured, allowing for very high speeds (with a goal of\r\n100 kHz), arbitrary model specifications, and real-time data logging on the\r\ncontrol computer; and open-source, meaning that the software and operating\r\nsystem upon which it is based are freely distributable and freely modifiable\r\nto suit a laboratory's specific needs. Conventional desktop operating\r\nsystems are unsuitable for real-time performance in the 10's of kHz range,\r\nthus this project will use Real-Time Linux, a derivative of the Linux\r\noperating system modified for performing real-time tasks, to achieve these\r\ngoals.  The specific objectives of this project are to develop a core\r\nreal-time control computational engine based on Real-Time Linux, develop a\r\nuser interface and mechanism for arbitrary model specification, and perform\r\nrigorous testing of the accuracy and validity of the technique.\r\n\r\nThis technology will impact the neuroscience and electrophysiology fields of\r\nresearch in several ways.  First, it will make the technique available to\r\nmore researchers, with a greater array of features available.  Second, the\r\nincreased speed of this approach will allow new experiments to be performed\r\nusing the dynamic clamp, such as those involving membrane processes with\r\nsubmillisecond time-constants, such as sodium currents in cardiac myocytes\r\nand synaptic currents from fast AMPA synapses.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
