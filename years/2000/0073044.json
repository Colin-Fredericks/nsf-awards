 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\n0073044\r\n\r\nThis research aims to develop new statistical methods, inference\r\nand theory for regression modeling of ordinal and bounded\r\ndata. Recent work indicates a strong possiblility of unifying \r\nthe most commonly used ordinal models and extending them to a \r\nbroader class of models. A unified approach will lead to comprehensive\r\nand flexible ordinal regression modeling. Further this line of\r\nresearch is directed at developing improved methods for\r\ntemporally and spatially correlated ordinal data. Bounded response \r\ndata are common in many applications. The second part of this \r\nproject will extend general regression methods and inference methods \r\nfor bounded response data. Parametric and semi-parametric methods\r\nwill be developed to model correlations among bounded responses.\r\nModern computing algorithms such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo\r\nprovide the means for developing software for correlated ordinal\r\nand bounded response data.   \r\n\r\nOrdinal modeling has widespread applicability in the social \r\nsciences and medical studies. Moreover ordinal modeling has \r\nrecently emerged as an important tool for risk assessment in \r\nenvironmental toxicology and in civil engineering applications \r\nwhere the probabilities of events of different severity \r\nneed to be modeled. Bounded response data are common in \r\ninfrastructure studies, which use bounded condition scores, \r\ne.g., 0-100 scale. The data may be correlated over time (e.g., \r\nthe history of a road section) and space (e.g., neighboring road \r\nsections are correlated). The methods being developed will improve \r\nmodeling and uncertainty assessments and will have applications \r\nin many fields such as environmental risk assessment, \r\ninfrastructure management, transportation risk modeling and the \r\nassessment of treatments for depression and other social\r\nfunctioning disorders.\r\n\r\n",
