 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. James Espenson and Dr. Andreja Bakac of Iowa State University are supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry program for a program of research dealing with the mechanisms of processes in which a single oxygen atom (or equivalent fragment) is transferred from one atom to another during chemical processes.  Several classes of such reactions will be studied. One of these is the catalysis of reductions of perchlorate ion by anions such as molybdate. The reactivity of nitric oxide (NO) with superoxo metal complexes and metal ions and related reactions will be explored. The research will also extend to the transfer of fragments that resemble oxygen (such as sulfur) and groups such as NR and CR2 that are isoelectronic with oxygen.\r\n\r\nMany chemical reactions that are of major practical significance involve movement of an oxygen atom originally attached to one molecule to another location, where that atom is attached to a quite different molecule. Other chemical entities (sulfur atoms, small organic fragments) participate in chemical changes that are quite similar, in important respects, to these simple atom-transfer processes. Drs. Espenson and Bakac will investigate several systems that hold promise of greatly extending understanding of the fundamental principles that govern atom-transfer reactions. At least two of these systems are also of major and immediate practical interest. Contamination by perchlorate ion is an emerging environmental hazard in many parts of the United States. Reduction by atom transfer is the best way to destroy perchlorate ion. Nitric oxide (NO) is known to be an important signaling agent within biological organisms. The functioning of this species is greatly influenced by atom transfer processes. Fundamental understanding sought in this research will bear on these and other important processes.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
