The vulnerability of\r\nnetworked computers to malicious or mischievous attack has become apparent\r\nwith several recent incidents.  With the present trend to connect more\r\nembedded systems to global networks, security is a growing concern.  The\r\ninvestigators on this project seek to identify aspects of well-studied\r\nembedded computing characteristics that can be extended and applied to\r\nissues of security.  \r\n\r\nThe primary objectives of this work are to develop a theoretical foundation\r\nfor embedded system security and to expand the base of security education\r\nfor computer engineers.  The theoretical foundation will build upon the\r\nbody of knowledge developed over past decades in availability, reliability,\r\nand safety research.  Educational modules will be made available and can be\r\nused in the future to form the basis for a more extensive educational\r\nprogram in this area.  The potential impact of this effort will include a\r\nsignificant increase in the sensitivity to embedded system security issues\r\namong those computer engineers who participate in the project or are\r\nexposed to the educational modules.  Further, new applications of existing\r\ntechniques will improve the evaluation and design of embedded systems to\r\ninclude security considerations.  Both of these impacts are significant to\r\nincrease the integrity of networked embedded computer systems.\r\n\r\n",
