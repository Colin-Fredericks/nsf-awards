These components are (1) the theory of flocking, i.e., collective motion of large swarms of organisms that attempt to follow their neighbors; (2) ordering of liquid crystals in a random media such as aerogels; (3) sliding phases in magnets, crystals, and DNA complexes; (4) live membranes such as biological membranes with ionic pumps; and, (5) mixed diffusion models of the transport of certain enzymes along DNA strands.  \r\n%%%\r\nThis renewal award continues support of theoretical research in the physics of soft condensed matter-that is, materials such as polymers and liquid crystals (used, e.g., in video displays).  The central focus of the research is on problems involving strong fluctuation effects in systems with many degrees of freedom such as disordered, nonequilibrium, and biological systems.  This effort supports research on such topics as flocking-the ability of large groups of entities, such as birds, to change direction almost instantaneously as a group-as well as transport in biological systems such as cell membranes and enzymes along DNA strands. \r\n***\r\n\r\n",
