Conner\r\nInstitution: University of Massachusetts\r\n\r\nThe 12th International Congress on Catalysis will be held in Granada, Spain during the week of July 9th.  The Council of the International Congress on Catalysis oversees these meetings and has representation from approximately 20 countries.  These meetings are held every four years, and the attendance has shown large increases due to a renewed world interest in the synthesis of specialty chemicals, petroleum-based products, and catalytic applications for the environment.  Attendance at the previous meeting exceeded 1250.  Because advances in a large number of catalytic processes, which are crucial to US interests, will be presented at this meeting, it is important to ensure participation from both the academic and industrial sectors.  The Congress will focus on the topic of \"New Frontiers in Catalysis.\"  Priority will be given to the following topics: molecular design of solid catalysts; recent developments in catalytic reactions; new experimental methods, and new industrial applications.  The proceedings of all International Congresses are published and constitute a significant contribution to the literature on catalysis.  This Congress will promote interchange among the international participants.  The purpose of this grant is to help defray costs for those participating in the meeting and for younger faculty. \r\n",
