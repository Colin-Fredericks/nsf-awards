 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves systematic research on the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) by transnational groups and individuals to forge interdependent, electronic networks of power to influence government policies and the response of governments to these networks in the age of information technology.  As countries explore the use of ICTs to maximize service delivery and facilitate economic competitiveness via electronic government, they must address balancing the expanded access of information technologies and the challenge to political rule.  The project will involve six steps: (1) identify and define three distinct populations that form transnational electronic networks; (2) introduce a theoretical model of electronic transnationalism; (3) conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses of ICT activities of the selected networks and the responses of governments to the networks; (4) construct a cyber-mapping or spatial analysis of ICT activities; (5) examine barriers to forging interdependent links in cyberspace and strategies to circumvent these barriers; and (6) create a typology of ICT-level of government and policy issues of electronic networks.\r\n\r\nThis project will contribute to the broader understanding of the formation of electronic networks, the monitoring and tracking of network activities, the use of new technologies by transnational groups to influence public policy and government practices, and the social and political factors shaping the advent of information technology.\r\n\r\nThe investigator's pursuit of a new educational direction that incorporates information technology into the classroom practice and course content has spawned an exciting, intense research agenda on the use of information and communication technologies by groups and individuals to influence government policies.  Through national and international conferences and other scholarly exchanges with academic peers, the researcher has been able to share preliminary findings on a theoretical model she has constructed to study the formation and role of transnational electronic networks.  To conduct the necessary empirical research to test the model, prepare the findings for scholarly dissemination via published papers, and move forward in this field of scientific inquiry, the researcher needs a twelve-month period of time to focus solely on research and writing.  A POWRE award will afford the researcher the time to dedicate her full priority to completing this research agenda and developing her credentials for full professor. With this award, the researcher seeks to intensify her research contribution to the scholarly community, enhance her status as a scientist in a newly emerging area of study, and strengthen her leadership role in a growing discipline in which women and minorities are underrepresented.\r\n",
