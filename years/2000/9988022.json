We will work in collaboration with this select group of schools to provide their students the kind of research experience only available at a major comprehensive research university.  This NSF-REU program will complement undergraduate internship programs for University of Missouri (MU) students funded by the University.\r\nThe research programs of the MU faculty mentors will center on the theme \"Cellular, Molecular, and Genetic Approaches to Biological Problems.\" These programs use methodology ranging from recombinant DNA technology to molecular cytology to sophisticated population genetics.  All NSF-REU faculty mentors will be personally involved in their research projects and have a history of highly successful partnerships with undergraduate intems.\r\nFaculty liaisons at our eight partner schools (Florida A&M University, Grinnell College, Jackson State University, Prairie View A&M University, Southwest Missouri State University, Truman State University, University of Arkansas-Pine Bluff, and Xavier University-Louisiana) will be responsible for the selection of the intems.  They will assist in the preparation of the intems before the summer research experience at MU and the continuation of the training of the intems when they return to their home campus.\r\nThe research experience is the heart of our summer program.  We will also help intems develop critical communications skills through brown-bag lunches, lab group meetings, and an end-ofprogram Summer Undergraduate Research Science Symposium.  We will provide financial support for intems to also present their research at regional and national meetings in their discipline.  Finally, we have developed a number of enrichment activities including panel discussions on preparation for graduate school and career options and a science ethics workshop.\r\n\r\n",
