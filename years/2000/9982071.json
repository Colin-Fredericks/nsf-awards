Pagilla, Oklahoma State University\r\n9982071\r\nCAREER: Robust Controllers for Large-Scale Interconnected Systems: \r\n\tApplications to Web Handling Systems\r\n\r\nLarge-scale interconnected systems appear in a variety of engineering applications \r\nsuch as large structures, power systems and manufacturing processes. Web handling \r\nsystems for web processing lines are true examples of large-scale interconnected \r\ndynamic systems with a large number of control and measurement variables. A web is \r\nany material in continuous flexible strip form which is very long compared to its \r\nwidth and very wide compared to its thickness. Examples include paper, fabrics, \r\nadhesive tape, photographic film and strip metals. Modeling and robust control of \r\nlarge-scale interconnected systems with applications to web handling systems is the \r\nfocus of this research. Accurate dynamic models for the web and the basic elements of \r\nweb handling systems, such as accumulators and dancers, will be developed. Based on \r\nthese models robust decentralized controllers will be developed. Significant \r\npractical problems in web processes such as disturbances due to misalignment of \r\nrollers and improperly wound rolls will be studied, and robust control schemes to \r\nreject these type of disturbances will be designed. Research activities are \r\nintegrated closely with education plans through common usage of equipment and \r\nbringing research problems into undergraduate and graduate curriculum. The education \r\nplan includes distance learning activities such as teaching courses via \r\ntwo-way-compressed-video and developing short courses for practicing engineers. The \r\nproposed work has significant impact on improving the performance of continuous web \r\nprocess lines. The theory development focuses on fundamental issues and general \r\ncontrol structures for large-scale systems and hence it will be relevant to other \r\napplications. The proposed distance learning activities and short course preparation \r\nwill provide practicing engineers to get easy access to university courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
