This proposal is targeted toward increasing the awareness of polymer research programs in secondary schools and encouraging high school students to pursue higher education in the area of polymer science and its related fields.  The research goal of this proposal is to develop a fundamental understanding on surfaces and interfaces of functionalized polymers containing hydrophobic side chains.  At present, it is unclear how molecular alignment and mobility of molecules at polymer surfaces influence properties such as surface tension, adhesion, friction, and contact angle hysteresis.  This research employs a nonlinear optical technique that shows excellent sensitivity to non-destructively probe chemical and local orientational information at polymeric surfaces and interfaces.  The influence of the length of alkyl side chains (polyvinyl N-alkyl carbamates) on molecular packing at surfaces, surface transition temperatures, surface restructuring, and the mobility of the surface layer will be studied.  This will enable the researchers to understand the complex interplay between thermodynamic surface energy, mobility at the interface, and the mechanism of adhesion and friction at a molecular level.\r\n\r\nFunctionalized polymers are used to make better adhesives, semi-permeable membranes, bio-materials, and liquid crystal displays.  The proposed research will provide fundamental information in these areas and will allow US industries to maintain their technological edge in the world market.  Furthermore, the development of interest in high school students and training of graduate students will provide the skilled  work force necessary for this competitive global market.\r\n",
