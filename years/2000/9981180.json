 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomy (11) The development of computer controlled telescopes has enabled the possibility of remote observing sessions for astronomy education that greatly expand the accessibility of telescopes to students. Several examples of K-12 astronomy education programs exist in which networked telescopes allow students from a diverse audience to conduct astronomical observations. This project is developing a new curriculum of astronomy laboratory activities with remote observing capabilities for undergraduate education using a larger aperture (1.0-meter) telescope controlled through a fast internet link and video conferencing. Based on others' work with remote telescopes and other observing projects, this project is developing a set of undergraduate astronomy labs that go beyond simple CCD imaging exercises to include spectroscopic observations of planetary nebulae, polarimetetric observations, photometric monitoring of quasars and AGNs, and astrometry of the moon and other solar system objects. A Remote Observing Center is being developed in the new Andrew Building at Pomona College to allow groups of students to control the Pomona College 1-meter telescope in Wrightwood, CA, and a small cluster of computer-controlled telescopes at Brackett Observatory on the campus of Pomona College in Claremont, CA. The development of these laboratory activities greatly extends the capabilities available to a much broader class of students in astronomy. The project is improving astronomy education for the large number of liberal arts students attending introductory astronomy classes, by greatly improving the depth and breadth of the observational astronomy component of the class. The class activities are also designed to allow use in advanced undergraduate classes. In both cases, remote observing capability extends the access to the telescopes by simplifying scheduling and logistics of observing, in an improved atmosphere of both small and large group collaborative learning.",
