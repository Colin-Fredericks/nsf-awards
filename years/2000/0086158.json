 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cankdeska Cikana Community College was part of cohort 3 of the Tribal College\r\nRural Systemic Initiative (TCRSI). Programs in this cohort received planning support in\r\nthe first year, with the subsequent two years used to implement systemic reform. As a\r\nresult of this initial funding, 100% of the teachers at the target schools were trained and\r\nbegan to implement standards based curriculum in their classrooms. Strategies for Phase\r\nII were selected based on extensive research on high poverty schools that scored highly\r\non standardized achievement measures. Effective reform efforts have been shown to\r\nprovide professional development programs of high quality, be well coordinated with\r\ndesired instructional outcomes results oriented, and have consistent policies throughout\r\nthe system. Successful schools carefully assessed student performance in comparison\r\nwith standards and created additional time for academic instruction. Based on this\r\nresearch, the C4 Initiative will expand on the following three fronts.\r\n\r\nPROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nStandards Based Curriculum training offered twice\r\nper year will acquaint new hires and provide current developments for experienced\r\nteachers. Additional training sessions will focus on standards based assessment, including\r\nobjective, standard alternative assessments to standardized tests. C4 will coordinate a\r\nSummer Science Institute during which teachers pilot lesson plans using independent and\r\nguided research in mathematics and science, and alternative assessment. With the\r\ncoordination of C4 this curriculum will be piloted, evaluated and revised by the teachers\r\ninvolved in implementing it. This teacher-as-researcher model is anticipated to\r\ncontribute to the scientific training of the workforce, and increase school commitment to\r\nthe curriculum. An innovation in this area is the inclusion of a second strand of training\r\nfor paraprofessionals, with a separate Summer Institute for teacher aides.\r\n\r\nCONSISTENT POLICIES \r\n\r\nThe existing RSI Council of reservation programs aimed at\r\nimproving SMET at the k through 14 level will be expanded to include Title I and RSI\r\nprograms on other reservation. This committee will meet monthly to coordinate activities\r\nthat will leverage resources, maximize teacher participation and have the optimal impact\r\non student achievement. The Project Director will be appointed a member of the\r\ncurriculum committee at each of the target schools. These committees are charged with\r\nadoption, implementation and publication of policies supporting standards based\r\ncurriculum and other aspects of systemic reform. Extensive use of telecommunications\r\nwill facilitate coordination with off-reservation programs.\r\n\r\nCOORDINATED RESOURCES\r\n\r\nExamples of resource coordination outcomes are dual\r\nhigh school-college credit course to increase advanced opportunities in mathematics and\r\nscience, and training at the state Indian Education Association conference supported\r\njointly by all North Dakota reservation RSI projects. RSI staff and Council will\r\ncoordinate the development of after-hours instruction in mathematics and science, funded\r\nby resources from private and federal grant funded programs already on the reservation.\r\nTraining for these programs and policy development will be provided with RSI funds and\r\nby the RSI Council respectively.\r\n\r\nCankdeska Cikana can draw upon three years of successful collaboration with the school\r\ndistricts and an experienced RSI Project Director who is an enrolled tribal member and\r\nalso a former middle school mathematics and science teacher. As such, the project begins\r\nwith a high level of credibility with the target school administrators and teachers.\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n",
