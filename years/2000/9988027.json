At Arizona State University the Center for the Study of Early Events in Photosynthesis, comprised of faculty in the departments of Plant Biology, Chemistry and Biochemistry, takes an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the energy storage process carried out by photosynthetic organisms and mimicking photosynthesis using artificial systems.  Undergraduate students will participate in the individual research programs of the Center faculty.  Projects will include organic synthesis and spectroscopic studies of model compounds, spectroscopic studies of bacterial and plant photosynthetic reaction centers, and molecular biology and genetics of photosynthetic systems.  Structured interaction between faculty and student participants, including the weekly photosynthesis seminar series, research group meetings, instrumentation workshops and a concluding undergraduate symposium, will help educate the students in the extremely diverse modem approach to the study of photosynthesis.  Student participants will be recruited from throughout the US, with emphasis on targeted colleges and universities in the West and Southwest United States, with the help of local department chairs and individual faculty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
