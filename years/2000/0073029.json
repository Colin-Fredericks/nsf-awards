 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0073029\r\nWilliam Kazez\r\n\r\nKazez proposes to study genuine laminations of 3-manifolds.  \r\nHe and his collaborator, D. Gabai, are interested in understanding \r\nthe geometry of the universal cover of a manifold containing a \r\ngenuine lamination, and in particular how it is related to the \r\ngeometry of the leaves of the lamination.  He also proposes to \r\nstudy representations of order trees.  Kazez along with \r\nK. Honda and G. Matic seek to understand the construction of \r\ntight contact structures from the point of view of a sutured \r\nmanifold decomposition.  For fibred knots with pseudo-Anosov \r\nmonodromy, the sutured manifold decompositions are quite simple, \r\nand they propose to study the classification problem in this \r\nsetting.\r\n\r\nKazez, along with his collaborators, proposes to study the \r\ninteraction and relationships between foliations and contact structures.  Both structures are a study of a family of two \r\nplanes in a 3-dimensional space, but these families appear \r\nto be extremely different.  One is everywhere integrable, \r\nthat is tangent to an embedded surface, the other is nowhere integrable.  In spite of this, as the ambient space is split \r\nalong surfaces, deep relationships start to become apparent.  \r\nIt is these relationships that we intend to develop and exploit.\r\n",
