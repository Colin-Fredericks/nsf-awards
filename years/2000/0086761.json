 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this New Technologies for the Environment project is to develop the new technologies needed in paper processing and agronomy to make mimosa (Albizia julibrissin) a viable materials substitute for hardwood fibers in fine paper manufacturing.  Quality writing and printing paper grades require a blend of long fibers derived from softwood and short fibers derived from hardwoods. Hardwoods are not plantation grown, making accessibility and proper reforestation difficult. Mimosa is a fast growing perennial plant and our preliminary studies show that it has pulp with qualities similar to that of southern hardwoods. This project focuses on studies that address:  (1) the response of mimosa to different pulping and paper making processes; (2) the response of mimosa to bleaching sequence; (3) the paper properties of mimosa in softwood and hardwood blends; (4) the optimum age of wood for mimosa harvesting; (5) genetic improvement of mimosa by making a germplasm (seed) collection from wild mimosa; and (6) evaluation of germination rate and early plant growth from this material.  The experiments synergize interactions among faculty and graduate students from Chemical Engineering, Agronomy and Soils, and the Auburn Pulp and Paper Research and Education Center. It includes research experiences for undergraduates in laboratory courses and through an undergraduate summer exchange program with minority students from Tuskegee University.\r\n\r\nThe environmental impacts of this work will be the reduction in harvesting of hardwoods in old growth forests, and the reduction in energy usage associated with the ease of pulping, bleaching, and refining of the mimosa fibers.\r\n\r\n",
