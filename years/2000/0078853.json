 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ho #0078853\r\n\r\nOur research addresses how people and organizations learn from experience\r\nin strategic situations like bargaining, coordinating joint actions\r\n(teamwork), choosing prices and features for new products, bidding in\r\nauctions, etc.  In previous research we discovered a mathematical formula\r\nwhich explains how people appear to learn from experience, but the\r\nnumerical details of the formula (its \"parameters) seem to vary from\r\nsituation to situation, as if people are learning in different ways. We\r\ntherefore propose to explore why these parameters seem to vary. In\r\naddition, most mathematical theories of strategic learning assume that\r\npeople only look back at past experiences. We also propose to extend these\r\ntheories to allow for people who realize that other people are learning\r\nfrom experience, and are able to therefore outguess what others will do\r\nbased on what happened in the past. If players are \"sophisticated\", in\r\nthis sense, it pays for them to take actions that are not perfect in the\r\nnear-term, to \"teach\" other players who are learning to take actions which\r\nwill benefit the \"teachers\" in the long-term. This teaching can be\r\nbeneficial for the teacher but bad for society (e.g., when firms scare\r\naway innovative competitors by threatening illegal retaliation), or\r\nbeneficial for everyone (e.g., when firms reassure others that they can be\r\ntrusted). Our research develops a precise mathematical theory of how\r\nsophisticated players behave and when it pays for them to teach.  We use\r\nthe theory to explain observations from experiments and predicts whether\r\nteaching will occur in new situations. \r\n",
