 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is supported under the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Program. It is designed to provide undergraduates with a unique opportunity to participate in field measurements under the direction of faculty who are part of a teem of atmospheric scientists (chemists, physicists and meteorologists). The 8-week research experience takes place coincident with summer measurement intensives during which students live in-residence with other students and faculty at the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) and work at the sampling tower and laboratory constructed through the Program for Research on Oxidants: PHotochemistry, Emissions and Transport (PROPHET). Students assist with the integration of instruments and inlet sampling systems and conduct on-site measurements of gas- and particulate-phase chemical species mixing ratios and/or fluxes and meteorological parameters. Each student is provided with training that allows them to take responsibility for the measurement of one or more chemical species or meteorological parameters or for the application of models to generate back trajectories or chemical species distributions. In addition to their hands-on, in-depth exposure to their specific measurement or modeling technique, they gain an overall understanding of related measurements and modeling activities and an appreciation for the significance of their own and their peers' efforts towards the achievement of the science team's research objectives. Ml team members live at the UMBS, share meals, and attend weekly data meetings to evaluate findings and measurement strategies",
