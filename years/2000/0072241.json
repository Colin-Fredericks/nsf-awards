 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nAward:  DMS-0072241\r\nPrincipal Investigator:  Elizabeth Werner\r\n\r\nThe PI's research deals with questions in affine geometry and\r\ngeometric probability of convex bodies as well as with\r\napplications.  A tool of considerable importance in the area of\r\nisoperimetric inequalities is the affine surface area from affine\r\ndifferential geometry whose classical definition goes back to\r\nBlaschke and involves the curvature function of a smooth convex\r\nbody. An important problem in convex geometry was to extend the\r\nnotion of affine surface area to all convex bodies. The solution\r\nof this problem has only been completed within the last\r\ndecade. At present, many extensions of the affine surface area\r\nexist, several of them discovered by the PI. The new techniques\r\nand ideas developed in the process of these extensions should be\r\nbeneficial for other problems, and the PI proposes to apply these\r\ntechniques to problems of approximation of convex bodies by\r\npolytopes. These approximation problems have been studied\r\nextensively and find application in many areas of mathematics and\r\ncomputer science. In one paper, for instance, the PI and her\r\ncollaborator proved the surprising result that random\r\napproximation by polytopes (choosing the vertices of the\r\napproximating polytope randomly on the boundary of the body) is\r\nas good as best approximation.  The Gaussian correlation\r\nconjecture in probability and statistics asserts that\r\norigin-symmetric convex sets are positively correlated under the\r\nstandard Gaussian measure.  In spite of several partial results\r\nobtained by many researchers within the last years, including the\r\nPI, the conjecture remains undecided.  Optimal estimates for the\r\ntail of the Gaussian distribution obtained in this context by the\r\nPI and her collaborators are also relevant for problems in\r\nmathematical physics (see e.g.Differential Equations and\r\nMathematical Physics, International Press 2000, p.43-51).\r\n\r\nThe PI wants to get an understanding of the structure of convex\r\nsets.  To do so she uses techniques from different areas of\r\nmathematics: analysis, differential geometry, convexity\r\ntheory. One wants to understand the structure of such sets as\r\nthey appear naturally not only in other branches of mathematics\r\nand mathematical physics, but also in applied areas, like\r\ntomography and image analysis, and computer sciences.  The PI and\r\nher collaborators plan to continue working on problems where\r\nconvexity and other areas of more applied mathematics\r\ninteract. Currently she is involved in a project related to\r\nquantum computing which uses -among other things- tools from\r\nconvexity theory.\r\n",
