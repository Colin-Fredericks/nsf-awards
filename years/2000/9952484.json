 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geology (42)  \r\nThis proposal uses environmental monitoring equipment, including global positioning systems (GPS), sonar, electronic water quality devices, bottom sampling (coring, dredging), water chemistry test kits and scuba equipment to implement field-based, multi-faceted science projects for undergraduate oceanography and geology courses.  This equipment enables restructuring of the lab component of several science courses to include field experiments and projects using modern oceanographic equipment and techniques.  This proposal is based upon research conducted at the Keck Geology Consortium (Manduca, 1996) whereby structuring hands-on and small group field research activities using modern field equipment for real-life data gathering situations, students have demonstrated deeper conceptual understanding and confidence in dealing with quantitative data.  They have learned how to design and carry out all phases of scientific investigation. The pedagogical value of field-based small group projects has also been substantiated in other science courses such as environmental science (de Wet, 1994) and at other inland lake locations (Smith, 1995)   A variety of field sites used include the volcanic lakes located in Newberry National Volcanic Monument, the scenic reach of the Deschutes River located near the college, and South Slough National Estuarine Reserve located on the southern Oregon coast.  The field based approach enables students to receive high quality, intellectually stimulating educational experiences and engages them in the collection of meaningful scientific data, provides opportunities for students to apply their knowledge to solving realistic problems in science, and increases student confidence with modern technology including quantitative applications. The target audience includes nontraditional students enrolled in K-12 education and applied science programs.  Eighty to one hundred students annually participate in the affected courses.  Student designed projects provide meaningful data with which to characterize and monitor the lakes, rivers and estuaries in Oregon.   The success of this curriculum restructuring is assessed by using pre- and post- course concept inventory testing, similar to that used by  Deslaughter (1998), project evaluation by the PI, peer evaluations, and train and trade exercises (Smith, 1995) used to gain familiarity with equipment. Exemplary projects are publicized through meetings and journals of American Geophysical Union and Geological Society of America.  The framework of this curriculum restructuring is designed to be readily adapted to any lake, river or coastal environment and to a variety of scientific disciplines.",
