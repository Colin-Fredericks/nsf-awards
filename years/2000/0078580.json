 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will design, fabricate and test a\r\nprototype gas-cluster ion-beam (GCIB) sputtering tool for depth profiles with\r\nmonolayer-specific surface analysis of thin films. Applications will be to multilayer\r\nthin films of key importance in the microelectronics industries including semiconductors,\r\nmetals in magnetic sensors, and dielectrics in photonic and micro-optical devices. The\r\nsputtering tool is expected to meet aggressive performance specifications including depth\r\nresolution of less than 1 nm in conjunction with mass spectrometry. This GCIB tool will\r\nbe designed particularly for in-situ sputtering with surface-analytical instruments\r\nincluding the secondary-ion mass spectrometer (SIMS), the Auger electron spectrometer\r\n(AES) and the x-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS). The overriding motivation is the\r\ncritical need in microelectronics for techniques to obtain accurate sputter depth\r\nmeasurements. The Phase-I effort demonstrated those GCIB methods with argon clusters\r\nsputter with near-atomic smoothness, high depth resolution and high secondary-ion yields.\r\nMinor instrumental design issues limited the cluster beam exposure uniformity and this\r\nartificially limited the average depth resolution measured. Straightforward engineering\r\nsolutions are well known and are expected to yield improvements in Phase II that will\r\nprovide depth resolution of well below 1 nm.\r\n\r\nThe proposed technology will enable analysis of next-generation microelectronics devices\r\nhaving much thinner films. Epion is the first and only to manufacture GCIB systems. The\r\ntool to be prototyped will enable and have a wide applicability to many areas of the\r\nelectronic materials processing and manufacturing industry.\r\n",
