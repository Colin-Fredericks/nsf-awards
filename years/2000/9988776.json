 "awd_abstract_narration": "As digital repositories of information are springing up everywhere and interconnectivity between computers around the world is being established, the construction and maintenance of data warehouses (views) over such distributed data sources has been recognized to be of great importance for modern applications. However, data sources continuously evolve by modifying not only their content but also their query capabilities and schema and by joining or leaving the environment. This research addresses this critical and timely problem of how to rewrite view definitions synchronously with the schema changes of data sources, coined the \"view synchronization\" problem. The Evolvable View Environment (EVE) solution is based on a preference model for view evolution and a meta model for capturing data source interrelationships. Algorithms that exploit different types of metadata and view evolution preferences to synchronize views are designed. Measures for ranking alternative view rewritings based on their quality are established. To assure survivability in any dynamic environment, a strategy for coordinating view synchronization under schema changes and the more traditional view maintenance under data changes is incorporated. Implementation of the EVE software system serves as a proof of concept and as an experimental test bed. Experimental evaluations are conducted to assess performance, applicability, and quality of the rewritings. A case study on applying the technology to Web and E-commerce applications helps to determine the applicability as well as the limitation of the technology. In summary, this project will advance not only the state-of-the-art in data warehousing, a core area of database technology, but the benefits are potentially far-reaching by providing techniques and software tools for simplifying access to large sets of dynamic distributed data sources.\r\nhttp://davis.wpi.edu/dsrg/EVE\r\n\r\n",
