The goals of the proposed study are to: a) develop innovative testing methodologies to measure interfacial fracture toughness at the meso and microscale levels, b) experimentally demonstrate the loss mechanisms and mode mixity effects on the structural integrity of PZT/Silicon interfaces, and c) formulate a law for the energy release rate and the fracture toughness that account for the materials anisotropy at the PZT/Silicon interface.  In addition, viscous loss mechanisms for the PZT material and the nature of  structural losses for the silicon will be investigated.  \r\n\r\nIn the educational plan the PI proposes to increase and modernize student involvement in the ongoing research, within and outside the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, by promoting research transfer into classrooms, and simultaneously increasing the number of women represented in engineering.  To increase the gender diversity, the PI will collaborate with Douglass College of Women.  Among other activities, a seminar series, with distinguished women in the field, will be held  in order to attract more women and minorities in engineering. The PI proposes to develop a new course in which she will promote state-of-the-art experimental techniques, modern principles and methods of analysis  used in the study of  MEMS.  The syllabus of the course will be closely related to the proposed program in order to create a direct link between research and teaching.\r\n***\r\n",
