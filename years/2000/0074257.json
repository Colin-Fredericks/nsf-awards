 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to develop a new family of stable high-order finite\r\ndifference methods suitable for the solution of wave problems\r\ninvolving many interfaces and significant geometric complexity.\r\nThese complications are addressed by embedding the computational\r\nproblem into a Cartesian grid and formulating methods such that\r\nthe position of the material interfaces as well as the physical\r\nproperties of the solution across the interface is accounted for\r\nproperly to the order of the scheme. Staggered grid as well as\r\nnon-staggered grid methods will be explored with the emphasis on\r\nthe development of a rigorous mathematical foundation for these\r\nschemes to ensure robustness and uniform stability for all grid \r\nsizes and embedded geometries. Appealing properties of embedding\r\nmethods such as the ability to model moving interfaces and the\r\nintroduction of virtual interfaces to enhance parallel performance\r\nwill be exploited to model a variety of wave problems in\r\nelectromagnetics, acoustics, seismology, and elasticity.\r\n\r\nThe increasing interest in the accurate and efficient solution\r\nof wave-dominated problems, e.g. problems in acoustic and \r\nelectromagnetics, over very long periods of time has spawned an \r\ninterest in the formulation of high-order accurate computational\r\nmethods for such problems. In this effort we propose to develop\r\na new class of computational techniques, specifically aimed at\r\nthe reliable and robust modeling of problems of a realistic\r\nsize and complexity, e.g., the modeling of the propagation of\r\nelectromagnetic and acoustic noise and its environmental impact, and\r\nthe modeling of underground waves of interest to the oil industry.\r\nThe proposed methods are unique in maintaining a very simple \r\ncomputational structure without sacrificing the accuracy, hence\r\novercoming a number of well known difficulties associated with\r\nexisting methods which require some kind of automated generation of\r\nthe computational grid on which the solution is computed.\r\nThese proposed developments will enable the modeling of\r\nvery complex and realistic scenarios and will, in combination \r\nwith high-performance computing facilities for which the\r\nmethods are well suited, allow for the modeling and analysis\r\nof complex wave dominated problems in a variety of areas of interest\r\nto engineers and scientists.\r\n",
