 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award for a REU Site.  Ten to twelve undergraduate students are competitively selected to spend three summer months at the Space Physics Research Laboratory, University of Michigan, where each works with one of the about 30 faculty members doing research in Airglow and Atmospheric Science Space Plasma Physics, Cometary Studies, Planetary Atmospheres, Air Pollution Transport, and Lidars.  In this research the students have opportunities to interact with their mentors, other undergraduate students in the program, graduate students at the university and other faculty members.  They are able to have hands on experience working with instrumentation which has or will fly in space, is making remote sensing measurements of the atmosphere, and fabricate and calibrate components of these state of the art systems.  They are also able to choose to construct and work with software packages which solve analytical expressions, present space flight data in image forms, and manipulate large data bases.  A portion of their experience involves attending weekly seminars given by the SPRL faculty staff, writing up their work in a report for their mentor (which may be publishable), and presenting their report orally to the students and staff.",
