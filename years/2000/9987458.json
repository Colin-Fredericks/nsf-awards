 "awd_abstract_narration": "CCR-9987458\r\nAbstract:\r\n\r\nWith the increasing demands of users for ever more complex features in\r\ntheir systems, interfaces to these systems necessarily also become\r\ncomplex.  At some point, the interfaces approximate a programming\r\nlanguage, and the system can reasonably use a compiler to efficiently\r\nhandle the users' directions.  We thus expect that compiler-writing\r\ntechnology will increasingly be demanded of software engineering\r\nprofessionals.  Unfortunately, compilers are often large, mysterious\r\nprograms, and compiler-writing somewhat of a black art. \r\n\r\nWe are developing a new approach to the development and exposition of\r\ncompilers for mostly functional languages.  Courses on compilers are\r\ngenerally centered around an extensive project through which a\r\ncompiler is developed.  Some attempt is often made to divide the\r\ncompiler into phases.  Traditionally, however, the early phases merely\r\ncover scanning and parsing and most of the real work is left as a\r\nsingle task.  This makes compiler courses either difficult, if\r\nstudents are left to deal with this problem on their own, or\r\ncontrived, if they are given substantial amounts of help from their\r\ninstructor.  The primary advantage of our approach is that students\r\ncan build a compiler in incremental stages and understand how each\r\nstage contributes to the project.  Thus, at any point in time, the\r\nstudents are only concerned with a single aspect of the target\r\narchitecture.  In this way, they gain an understanding of how the\r\nsource and target architectures relate to each other and no longer\r\nview them as totally disparate worlds.  An additional advantage of our\r\napproach is that instructions at different levels can be interleaved,\r\nso that transformations can be written and debugged for one language\r\nform at a time.  All of this will make compiler-writing far less\r\nmysterious and make compiler courses accessible to many more students.\r\n\r\nWe are submitting this request under Small Grants for Exploratory\r\nResearch because we wish to pursue this research immediately.  This\r\nnew approach, if further developed, could greatly affect Indiana\r\nUniversity's undergraduate compiler course this spring.  We will also\r\nmake the results of our efforts available to the larger educational\r\ncommunity through submissions to education-oriented conferences and/or\r\nthe publication of relevant texts.\r\n\r\nAlthough our primary motivation at this point is educational, the\r\nbenefits of our approach are likely to range much further.  They\r\nshould include the ability to reuse components in compilers with a\r\ndifferent source or target language, to the point where writing a\r\ncompiler involves plotting a course through a variety of intermediate\r\nlanguages or programming styles or architectures.  Then, a change to\r\nany one architecture will have minimal impact on the family of\r\ncompilers.  A second advantage is that optimizations can be added\r\nindividually, at the highest appropriate level.  Finally, support for\r\nthe interleaving of instructions at different levels should make the\r\ndevelopment of compilers much less expensive and error-prone.  It\r\nshould also help to improve intuitions and understanding of \r\nissues of just-in-time compililation that have become pressing with\r\nthe increased popularity of the Java programming language.",
