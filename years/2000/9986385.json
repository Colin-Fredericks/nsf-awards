 "awd_abstract_narration": "Do workers complement one another, one's strength aligning with another's\r\nweakness and vice versa? The implications of this question are substantial\r\nwhen considering the learning characteristics of a company's workforce. For\r\nsome industrial tasks, slow learning produces greater productivity in the\r\nlong run, and fast learning greater short-run productivity. This research\r\nproject will address the above question and determine whether workers\r\ncomplement one another with respect to improving overall productivity in\r\nthe workplace. With the emerging movement of business and industry toward\r\nshorter market lifecycles, more aggressive cross-training, flexible\r\nmanufacturing, and quick-response manufacturing, worker learning and\r\nforgetting behavior has a heightened impact on company performance. This\r\nresearch will identify and evaluate policies for assigning workers to tasks\r\nbased on such individual characteristics in order to improve efficiency and\r\npossibly even worker morale.
