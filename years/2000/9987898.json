 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on creating a computer system that serves as musical accompanist in non-improvised music for soloist and accompaniment.  The system will \"hear\" the soloist by performing a real-time analysis of the acoustic signal to determine when important musical events take place.  As the piece of music is rehearsed, the system will train a probabilistic model of the soloist's rhythmic interpretation;   it will understand both what it \"knows\" and what it \"doesn't know\" about the soloist's interpretation by modeling both mean behavior and covariance structure.   The predictive power of this model will be combined with the real-time signal analysis to enable the  system both to follow and to anticipate the soloist.   In addition, the system will be presented with expressively played examples of the accompaniment and will train and utilize a model of the accompaniment's musical interpretation based on these.  The goal is to create a system that demonstrates both the technique and musicality necessary to achieve a high level of music-making.   From a modeling point of view, the primary challenge is one of knowledge fusion.  The system is faced with a number of disparate sources of knowledge including the musical score, the real-time analysis of the soloist's acoustic signal, training data from the past rehearsals, and inherent musical  constraints on the accompaniment.  A probabilistic model, a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN), will be developed that incorporates and balances these knowledge sources in a way that is musically believable,  automatically trainable, and computationally efficient.   The resulting system will be an invaluable teaching tool, as well as an aid to musicians preparing for performance.   The approach should be applicable to other domains as well.  Finally, if such an accompaniment system passes the musical equivalent of the \"Turing Test\" it would comprise a new and unexpected data point to be considered in our evolving understanding of the bounds of human and artificial intelligence.",
