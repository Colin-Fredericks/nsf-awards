 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent advances in computer and network technologies and storage, and the vast increase in data availability from sources such as the Internet and satellites present a new challenge to the ways data and information are used and managed. The objective of the workshop is to bring together the PIs and Co-PIs currently funded by the Information and Data Management Program (IDM) of the National Science Foundation to: (1) cooperatively identify the problems that are fundamental in making progress toward this new challenge, specify areas where major breakthroughs appear possible, identify needed collaborations, and identify research initiatives and facilities needed to meet the challenge; (2) provide demonstrations and interact with each other on the objectives, contributions and challenges of major research activities funded by the IDM; and (3) provide an opportunity to program officers from NSF and other government agencies, and industry representatives to learn more about the current research efforts and successes of projects funded by IDM, and for such officers to share their program highlights and concerns. The workshop will generate a report on all projects currently funded by IDM in both hard copy and electronic form. It will help in formulating future directions of research and will suggest promising modalities of research with an aim to foster innovation and technology transfer. The proceedings will provide project information searchable by different criteria and provide connections between discoveries and their use to society.",
