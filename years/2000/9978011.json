Hughes\r\nIn a continuation of their highly productive prior grant under the Partnerships for Enhancing Expertise in Taxonomy (PEET), focusing on basidiomycete fungi, the researchers will emphasize genera and other groups needing attention in the broad context of morphological, molecular, and mating system studies. The number of taxa in each project is limited so that each group can be examined using a variety of techniques. These methods include morphological study; updating of nomenclature and typification of species names; mating compatibility tests; molecular fingerprinting (using various DNA methods); and phylogeny reconstruction using DNA sequence data. Specific projects likely will include: A. Systematic studies in Polyporus  ss. str. (trainee Dirk Krueger, with Dr. Leif Ryvarden as PEET partner); B. Collybioid fungi of Costa Rica (trainee Juan Luis Mata, with Dr. Roy Halling as partner); C. systematic studies in Melanotus (trainee A. David Sime; already in progress with Dr. Scott Redhead as partner); D. phylogenetic studies in Clavicorona (trainee Edgar Lickey); E. systematic studies in New World Lentinus  (unidentified trainee, with advice from Dr. D.N. Pegler); F. systematic studies in Baeospora and Strobilurus (unidentified trainee, with Redhead as partner); G. descriptive material in Ramaria subgenera Laeticolora and Lentoramaria (PI). The PEET partners represent domestic and foreign institutions, and all are experts in morphological taxonomy of their respective groups.\r\nLarge portions of research will be computer-aided, and abstracts of projects and publications will be made available as part of current web pages maintained at the University of Tennessee. Fungus herbarium and culture databases (TENN-Fu; CULTENN) will be mounted as interactive sites for search by outside workers. A new database of type collections in the Tennessee Fungal Herbarium will be added, along with an extensive collection of photographs representing specimens of clavarioid fungi in the herbarium. Student \"experts in training\" will complete monographic research projects as part of their graduate degree requirements, with input from PEET partners. Partners will be visiting members of their graduate committees and when possible will attend the defense of dissertation. All trainees will receive instruction with taxonomic tools (i.e. nomenclature, molecular techniques, biogeography), data-handling (i.e. DELTA, phenetic analyses, PAUP, GCG, etc.), herbarium management (including databasing), and field logistics and techniques.  Incoming students without molecular skills will complete a 1-semester lab rotation in the Co-PI's lab for training.  Students will also complete coursework in nomenclature, molecular systematics and biogeography as a core requirement for their studies.  Remaining skills are taught on an individual basis by the PIs and PEET partners.\r\n\r\n",
