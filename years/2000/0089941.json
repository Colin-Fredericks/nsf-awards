Bartol\r\nTitle: Understanding Female and Minority Retention and Success in the IT Workplace: Total Rewards and Social Networks Perspectives  \r\n\r\nThis CISE Information Technology Workforce (ITW) proposal requests funds for a research program aimed at addressing fundamental issues underlying the effective utilization, retention, and upward mobility of women and minorities in the IT workplace.  The project takes a multidisciplinary approach to the design and implementation of three studies aimed at better understanding these issues.  The first study adopts a total rewards perspective in analyzing the IT workplace success and retention of women and minorities.  The second study uses social network analysis to study interaction patterns among members of an IT organization and their impact on women and minorities.  The third study longitudinally tracks students graduating from undergraduate programs in IT to learn more about how early perceptions and subsequent experiences influence career success and retention for women and minorities.  This project has the potential to provide valuable insights about the retention and advancement of women and underrepresented minorities in IT careers.\r\n",
