 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to perceive an object's motion is essential to our\r\ninteracting with objects, including avoiding objects that are about to\r\ncollide with us.  In addition, our ability to predict where an object\r\nwill emerge after traveling behind another object (occluder) depends\r\nupon our ability to accurately perceive the object's motion trajectory. \r\nThis project is designed to better understand how the human visual\r\nsystem processes trajectory motion information.  Several experimental\r\napproaches will be used to study trajectory motion processing.  The\r\naccuracy of observers' speed and direction judgments of a target object\r\nwill be measured and the effects of other moving objects (motion noise)\r\non those judgments will be determined.  How accurate observers can\r\ndetermine where an object, moving on a straight trajectory, will emerge\r\nfrom behind an occluder will also be measured.  How this performance is\r\naffected by the length of time the object is hidden and the distance\r\nthat the object travels while hidden will be determined.  The same\r\ninformation will be obtained for objects moving on curved trajectories. \r\nIt is expected that objects moving in similar directions and speed will\r\nhave a large detrimental effect on judgments of a target object's motion\r\nwhile objects with dissimilar motions will have little effect.   It is\r\nalso expected that the if a moving object is hidden behind an occluder\r\nfor an extended period of time and travels a large distance, predictions\r\nof where it will emerge will be poor.  In addition, curved motion\r\ntrajectories should make performance even worse.  This project will help\r\nscientists better understand motion perception and how the brain\r\nprocesses trajectory motion information.\r\n\r\n",
