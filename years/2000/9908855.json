Three main objectives are proposed:  (1) determination of the atomic structure, growth mechanisms and kinetics of ZrN plates and grains in Zr-N alloy for comparison with theories of phase transformations in interstitial alloy systems; (2) determination of the atomic structure and properties of solid-liquid interfaces in Al-Si/Ge alloys for comparison with atomistic calculations of solid-liquid interfaces and also with the theory of solute partitioning during solidification; and (3) determination of the atomic structure of massive transformation interfaces in Ti-Al and Fe-Ni alloys, combined with complementary development of crystallographic and kinetic theories for predicting the structure and behavior, respectively, of interfaces between phases with irrational orientation relationships and habit planes.  The main experimental techniques employed in this research include static and in-situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), static and in-situ energy-filtering TEM, and atomic modeling of interfacial structure.  \r\n%%%\r\nThe results from this research will enable materials scientists to better understand and utilize fundamental principles of interface science and transformation theory in the development of metal alloys for a wide range of technologically important applications.  It contributes to human resources primarily through graduate education, providing students the opportunity to perform state-of-the-art research in phase transformations, interface science and high-resolution and analytical transmission electron microscopy.\r\n***\r\n",
