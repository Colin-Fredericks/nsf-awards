 "awd_abstract_narration": "9984298\r\nThis research concerns on the computational and experimental characterization of microstructural toughening effects in advanced ceramics. Focusing on a new TiB2/Al2O3 ceramic composite system \r\nwith very promising properties, it will (1) yield a novel micromechanical approach for explicit fracture modeling over multiple size scales, (2) characterize the effects of microstructural morphologies, \r\nphase length scales, constituent properties, and interphase bonding on fracture resistance, (3) elucidate the failure modes and develop failure models for ceramic composites with microstructures of multiple size scales, and (4) identify mechanisms for property enhancement through microstructural revisions.Combined modeling and experiments will focus on the full, time-dependent process of damage initiation, damage progression and failure using time-resolved diagnostics. Experiments will be used to allow direct correlation of applied loading, time-resolved response, and microscopic damage. The education component of this program consists of undergraduate curriculum development at Georgia Tech, outreach to local high school students and teachers for recruitment and engineering awareness, outreach to minority students for recruitment, and outreach to a local minority institution. The curriculum innovation recognizes the drawback of classroom instruction without hands-on experimentation in engineering mechanics education. This effort focuses on strengthening Georgia Tech's undergraduate curriculum in mechanical engineering through proper integration of classroom learning with laboratory experimentation. A novel feature of this effort is the use of an experimental technique developed in the proposed research to facilitate the development of an aptitude for comprehensive engineering analysis. The curriculum innovation and outreach will use the facilities also used for research, offering a natural synergy of graduate research, undergraduate participation, curriculum development, and outreach.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
