 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI's will study workplace charitable giving in three cities, Washington DC, Chicago, and San Francisco.  In addition, they will survey several other cities across the U.S. for comparison.  Changes over the past 25 years (1975 - 2000) will be documented, in terms of whether the giving is \"designated\" to particular recipients, and whether the collector of the charity is public or private.  Investigators will first interview about 20 respondents in each of the three focal cities.  From those interviews, they hope to reach some conclusions about reasons for different charitable patterns in the three cities, and for changes taking place in kinds of giving over the past 1/4 century.  The second part of the study will be a mail survey of residents in about 100 additional cities, to check on the accuracy of the causal inferences drawn from the interviews.  While the results of this research have obvious practical implications for fund raising, they also shed light on processes of voluntary affiliation and rational choice models of behavior.",
