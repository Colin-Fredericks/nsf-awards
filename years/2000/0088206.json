Payne, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\r\nProposal Number #0088206\r\nAdditive Patterning of Integrated Functional Materials on a Chip\r\n\r\n\tA critical issue for the future engineering of microsystems on a chip is the ability to rapidly pattern dissimilar materials in complex integrated systems.  A novel, additive method of patterning is proposed that will enable integration of functional materials (e.g., electrical, mechanical, optical, etc.) on a chip, rather than as a discrete component added into the circuit and system.  Specifically, an interdisciplinary investigation is planned to examine additive patterning of integrated electroceramic thin film devices and to develop a better understanding of the complex residual stress development in the films during this process.  Integration of electroceramic thin films is a key technology for the realization of future micro electromechanical (MEM) device applications such as miniaturized sensors and actuators, ultrasonic motors and optical elements as well as nonvolatile memory elements and switching capacitors for integrated circuitry.   In order to advance this technology for the next generation of electromechanical devices, it is essential to develop a fundamental understanding of the residual stresses generated in the films during patterning, the effects of these stresses on film properties and how to tailor these stresses for optimal device performance.  Specific goals of this interdisciplinary investigation include: (i) development of new protocols to pattern thicker electroceramic films and multilayer devices where residual stresses are most critical, (ii) in-situ measurement of residual stress development during patterning, (iii) development of analytical models to understand the role of the substrate, film adhesion, and processing conditions on residual stress, (iv) characterization of the electromechanical properties of patterned films and assess the effects of residual stress on performance, and (v) development of a strategy for tailoring the residual stress state for optimal performance and reliability of the device. \r\n",
