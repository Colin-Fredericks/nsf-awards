 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Sciences (31), Engineering - Other (59), Mathematical Sciences (21) The goal of the NSF-CSEMS Scholars Program is to enable computer science, mathematical sciences, and engineering students participating in the program at the Associate, Bachelor's, or Master's degree level to complete their relevant degrees in two years. Furthermore, students are receiving support, information, and encouragement to pursue continuing educational opportunities even as they join the CSEMS workforce. The program features a partnership that includes Pasadena City College (PCC) and East Los Angeles College (ELAC), two long time Cal State L.A. community college collaborators. Given the demographic data of all three institutions, the NSF Scholars Program automatically serves one of the most diverse and traditionally under-served student populations in the country. The Cal State L.A. NSF-CSEMS Scholars Program has three distinguishing characteristics: 1) all NSF scholars pursuing any one of the three degrees have opportunities to share experiences, with senior scholars acting as mentors for the younger ones; 2) shared activities encourage students to move from AAs and BAs to Master's degrees and beyond; and 3) the Program is expanding collaborative programs and activities both among the partners and within each institution. Program activities include: For Cal State L.A. students, a specifically designed one-unit course required during the fall quarter of each academic year (or each quarter of the academic year) to promote academic, leadership and interpersonal skills. Faculty from the targeted disciplines are also introducing ongoing state-of-the-art research projects which students can join. The collaborating campuses are sponsoring special CSEMS CAREER DAYS, in addition to offering regular, ongoing support services. A set of periodic special event meetings allows all scholars to come together, promoting the Program theme of advancing through the A.A. to graduate school and a career. Forty scholarships are awarded annually: 10 at PCC; 10 at ELAC; and 20 at Cal State L.A.",
