 "awd_abstract_narration": "(99),(32),(31),(21) The Computer Engineering/Computer Science and Mathematics NSF Scholars Program is a multi-component approach to improving retention and graduation rates, preparing students for higher education or the workplace, and strengthening ties with industry partners of the Department of Computer Engineering and Computer Science and the Department of Mathematics.  The university setting is a notably diverse, urban community that attracts large numbers of students from groups traditionally under represented in CSEMS fields. The CECS&M NSF Scholars Program is working in synergy with campus-wide efforts to improve retention and graduation. Through the Program, the Departments of CECS and Mathematics are reaching their goals by: (1) providing outreach to low-income, academically talented full-time students who are likely to complete their degrees in CECS or Mathematics within two years; (2) providing NSF scholarships for qualified students; (3) forming the NSF Scholars Program within the participating departments as a learning community to promote retention and graduation; (4) providing personalized mentoring and curriculum advising; (5) providing tutoring from honor society members, including participation in the Learning Assistance and Math Tutorial Centers; (6) providing assistance with placement of NSF Scholars in internships and co-ops; (7) providing mid- and end-of-semester tracking of NSF Scholars for progress to degree; and (8) providing documentation of best practices to promote successful retention and graduation. Program outcomes are being documented and evaluated to determine best practices for achieving the Program goals.",
