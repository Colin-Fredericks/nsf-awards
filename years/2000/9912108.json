 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides renewed support for the annual Summer Workshops on Economic Theory conducted each summer by the Stanford Institute of Theoretical Economics (SITE). This six-week collection of workshops brings together prominent scholars as well as younger economists for presentation and discussion of their current research. This workshop series has just completed its 30th year and continues to serve as an international forum for the study of innovative topics in economic theory, mathematical economics, and related areas. The topics covered in SITE programs and the content of the sessions offer valuable and unique opportunities for economists to come together. Some topics, such as general equilibrium, microeconomic theory, and game theory, are long-term interests of SITE.  However, the topics of SITE sessions have evolved, just as economic theory and mathematical economics have evolved in economics generally. Accordingly, sessions based on newer topics, such as empirical work based on theoretical models, computational methods, strategic interactions, theoretical public finance, and theoretical macroeconomics, represent new directions that SITE has taken in recent years and expects to continue in future years. The more applied sessions at SITE, such as computation and theory-based econometrics, focus on the relation to economic theory and mathematical techniques. The macroeconomics sessions are also more focussed on the theoretical and mathematical aspects of those topics than the typical macroeconomic conference.",
