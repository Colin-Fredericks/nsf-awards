The long-term goal is to develop a Biochemistry major at the College.  Experiments from the educational literature are being extended and modified in order to introduce students to spectroscopic analysis in the basic physical science core courses.  A UV-Vis spectrophotometer is being used in experiments relating to nucleic acid structure analysis, protein analysis, and kinetics. The project is strengthening the chemistry curriculum by adding to the use of modern technology in lecture and laboratory courses for science and non-science majors. Students are engaged in learning about molecular structure by conducting analyses relating to electronic transitions and molecular orbitals, and studying the effects of structural features on these analyses. Hands-on use of the instrument begins in the Organic laboratory with the characterization of chlorophylls extracted from plants. Students study environmental and biochemical applications, such as thermal denaturation of DNA, and multicomponent analysis in the Analytical/Environmental Chemistry course. Novel forensic science applications are being developed. The instrument is supporting the growing interest of our students in undergraduate research projects, establishing further connections in learning how science is done and making them better prepared for graduate school and industrial employment in chemistry. The project will influence an outside audience with dissemination of project results through presentations, publications in international chemistry research and chemistry education journals, the World-Wide Web, and interactions with educators at scientific meetings. The success of the project will be determined by the establishment of the two-semester Biochemistry course with laboratories, student course evaluations, the number of majors taking undergraduate research projects, formal presentations, publications, and surveys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROJECT DATA FORM AND PROJECT SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe Department of Chemistry plans to augment the current one-semester lecture-only Biochemistry course to a two-semester course with labs in both semesters. The long-term goal is to develop a Biochemistry major at the College. The acquisition of a UV-Vis spectrophotometer will permit inclusion of experiments relating to nucleic acid structure analysis, protein analysis, and kinetics. The project will strengthen the chemistry curriculum by adding to the use of modem technology in lecture and laboratory courses for science and non-science majors.
