Emphasis was placed on discussion of the state-of-the-art, unpublished research in signal transduction, the mechanisms by which growth factors and the ECM regulate cell fate, and their application to tissue engineering. Two roundtable discussions facilitated close interaction between researchers working in the fields of cytokine signal transduction, ECM, and tissue engineering. A workshop on career and research funding opportunities in these areas also was held. The meeting provided a platform for the development of long term interdisciplinary   interactions, and exposed students and young professionals to the latest ideas and opportunities at the confluence of signal transduction, molecular and cellular biology, and tissue engineering. \r\n",
