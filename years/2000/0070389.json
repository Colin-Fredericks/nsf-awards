 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract Munakata Marr 0070389\r\n\r\nAn automated research microscope with state-of-the-art digital imaging capabilities will be used to support a wide variety of biological research at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM), research that is currently performed off-campus or not at all.\r\n\r\nImmediate use of the microscope will encompass a broad spectrum of environmental biological research.  One major application will be the use of fluorescent genetic probes to identify specific microorganisms in natural soils, in wastewater treatment systems, in biological systems that produce or consume greenhouse gases, and in bioremediation systems.  These microbes, for example, remove nitrogen from wastewater, transform chlorinated solvents or arsenic in groundwater, or produce methane or carbon dioxide.  In addition, fluorescent bacteria will be used to monitor the treatment of acid mine drainage and the removal of pathogens from drinking water and wastewater.  Finally, the microscope will be used to develop new methods of bacterial analyses for public health and food safety applications.\r\n\r\nThis microscope will allow CSM to more closely integrate microbiology with engineering and other sciences.  Because the projects described above are conducted primarily by engineers and chemists in collaboration with microbiologists, the ability to perform sophisticated microscopic analyses will provide new insights into microbial influences and interactions in engineered and human-impacted systems.  These insights are expected to have far-reaching implications in diverse fields ranging from drinking water safety to global warming.  In addition, the microscope will have a significant impact within the university.  The Colorado School of Mines has traditionally focused on the beneficial utilization of natural resources, excelling in such fields as mining, geological engineering and petroleum engineering.  CSM has recently recognized the importance of biological sciences, and this microscope will provide valuable support toward establishment of a viable, formal biology program.\r\n",
