 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project research goals are to develop theoretical models and computer simulations that can pre-dict the properties of complex mixtures containing particulates, and thereby be able to guide ex-perimental efforts along more fruitful directions. The motion of particles influences the behavior of fluids, and the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the fluids in turn affect the movement of  particles. To accurately capture flow properties of complex fluids containing particles, hydro-dynamic interactions must be included in the description of the system. Currently, there are no ef-ficient methods for simulating hydrodynamic interactions in three dimensions for mixtures of multicomponent fluids and mobile, solid particles. To overcome this stumbling block and achieve prediction of properties of polymeric composites, the project is devoted to collaborative development of innovative computational techniques. \r\n%%% \r\nThis is a research enhancement grant made under the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE) program. The project provides partial support for a sabbatical year which the PI will spend collaborating with Prof. Julia Yeomans at Oxford University, UK. The collaboration with Prof. Yeomans is expected to provide a unique opportunity for integrating the PI's experience in modeling polymer/particle mixtures with her expertise in modeling the hy-drodynamic behavior of fluids. In addition to research activities at Oxford, the PI will play an ac-tive role in mentoring students at St. Hilda's College, which is the only women's college in Ox-ford, and students associated with the Physics and Materials Departments. The project is co-supported by the Division of Materials Research, and the MPS OMA(Office of Multidisciplinary Activities). \r\n***\r\n",
