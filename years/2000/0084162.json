 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI/Institution: Donald Dane Quinn university of Akron\r\nProposal Number: 0084162\r\nTitle: Dynamic Resonances in Mechanical Systems\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project will be used to develop an experimental multi-component structure which exhibits resonances that depend on the state of the system due to coupling of the dynamics associated with the various components.  The proposed coupled system will slowly move in and out of a state of resonance as time evolves, a phenomenon that for example is encountered in multi-bladed turbine disks.  Successful completion of this facility will enable investigations on the development of tools for implementation of reduced-order models and equations that capture the pertinent coupled dynamics these complex systems.  If successful, the proposed project will also enable advances that can lead to the development of tools for capture of alternative models of complex dynamic coupling, such as those introduced by intermittent contact and friction. \r\n",
