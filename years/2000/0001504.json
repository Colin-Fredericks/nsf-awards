The meeting will provide the opportunity for the participants to meet and confer with world leaders in research directed to the development of bioartificial organs as is illustrated by the preliminary technical program included in the proposal.\r\n\r\nThe conference is being organized and directed by highly competent individuals who have an enviable track record of successes (most recently Bioartificial Organs II, 1998). All plenary and invited papers are to be published by the New York Academy of Sciences in a book entitled Bioartificial Organs to be edited by the conference organizing committee.\r\n\r\n",
