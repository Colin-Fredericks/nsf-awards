 "awd_abstract_narration": "he focus of this research is the development of asymmetric methods for synthesis using boronic acid chemistry and, as an example, the stereocontrolled synthesis of small rings via cyclization of chloro boronic esters to enolates will be probed.  The borosilicate glass surface catalyzed  ligand exchange that converts stable boronic esters to alkylboron chloride amine complexes plus diol sulfites will also be studied in order to affect the recovery of valuable chiral directors.  Further, this reaction also has potential for converting highly hindered asymmetric boronic esters into more reactive borane derivatives.\r\n\r\nWith this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Donald S. Matteson of the Department of Chemistry at Washington State University.  Professor Matteson will focus his work on developing asymmetric synthesis methodology using  boronic ester chemistry.  The area of research is excellent for the training of graduate students and the results of the research could have implications for the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.",
