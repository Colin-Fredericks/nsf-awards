 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earth Systems Science (40) We are adapting and implementing learning activities that improve the visualization, modeling, and computational skills of undergraduate students in introductory through advanced level geoscience courses. Our project has three components: (1) introducing GIS and image processing analysis in courses for majors; (2) incorporating modelling and visualization tools in upper division courses for majors, and (3) implementing computational activities into our courses for non-science majors. The courses directly impacted by this implementation plan include Natural Sciences (freshman year), Introductory Geology (freshman year), Computer Applications (sophomore year), Mineralogy (junior year) and Geomorphology (senior year). \r\nImplementing GIS and image processing analysis in our undergraduate curriculum is proceeding in phases and uses existing materials developed as part of a previous NSF curriculum development grant to the PIs as well as new materials. Curriculum materials are available at (http://www.geo.arizona.edu/geomorphology/geos450/geos450.html) and (http://www.geo.arizona.edu/sage/gis/). Students use GIS and spatial analysis tools to investigate problems ranging from site analysis studies, to hazard mitigation, to managing water resources. These materials are used in our Introductory Geology, Computer Applications and Geomorphology courses. \r\nIn Mineralogy, students use a variety of applications to investigate the properties of minerals and crystal structures. Software includes XTALDRAW, an interactive program that draws images of crystals at the atomic scale in several ways, METRIC to compute crystal chemical parameters, XPOWPLOT which creates images of theoretical powder diffraction patterns. The software and the classroom activities are available at http://www.geo.arizona.edu/xtal/person.html.\r\nWe are also integrating problem solving and system analysis in Computer Applications and Geomorphology courses using Rivertools, XGobi, Stella II and Excel. Students use Rivertools and digital elevation models to extract a channel network and analyze the hypsometry, number, length, slope and other characteristics of the channels. They also use Xgobi and Stella to investigate characteristics of individual rivers and the relationships between suspended and dissolved loads. \r\nIn our Natural Sciences courses for non-science majors, we utilize a variety of interactive programs which allow students to explore basic concepts, visualize geologic processes and evaluate situations. We have adapted materials from our Introductory Geology course that use TASA Graphics Topographic Maps and Plate Tectonics, Geostructures, ArcView and the Planet Earth series of software.\r\n",
