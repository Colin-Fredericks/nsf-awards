The program directly impacts twenty-four students (eight per summer) by giving them first-hand experience with several of the most rewarding activities that characterize graduate study and research careers. research project topics are selected from the faculty mentors' current areas of interest.  Students have full access to DePauw University's library and computing facilities including specialized equipment such as a 72\" diagonal touchsensitive interactive whiteboard which supports some of the projects.    Each student  has several opportunities to present his/hers work more formally to other participants in the REU program, as well as to external audiences. Finally, the students have the chance to attend talks given by the faculty mentors and visitors, and to learn about the graduate school application process in part by visiting a major research university.  \r\n",
