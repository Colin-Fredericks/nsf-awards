The PI proposes to spend three weeks in Australia developing a collaboration to study associations between the physiology and demographics of reef corals on the Great Barrier Reef.  In Australia, the PI will spend a week at the University of Sydney followed by two weeks in the field at One Tree Island.  The PI and student, together with Australian colleagues, will conduct trial experiments and collect preliminary data on the population sizes of possible experimental species on the reefs of One Tree Island, in anticipation of preparing a full collaborative research proposal.\r\n\r\nThe topic is important to basic research in coral reef and other coastal systems, and the proposed planning visit should lead to a continuing collaboration.\r\n",
