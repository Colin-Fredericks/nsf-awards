The series will examine the earth using the latest satellite imagery as well as from providing a more closeup view through the eyes of people who inhabit the many different regions of the world.  It will use intimate personal portraits to show how people's every day lives are affected by both local and global environmental pressures.  The series will link the sciences with economics, politics, geography, and history.  Each episode will feature four to five related stories and case studies selected from different geographic regions and about people from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThe television series will be supported by an informal, community-based outreach program in science museums and neighborhood centers, activity kits and teaching guides, interactive workshops on the World Wide Web, and strategic partnerships with environmental organizations to raise public awareness of the series and the outreach activities.  The Co-PIs and producers of the television series are Marilyn and Hal Weiner.  They will work closely with a group of advisors including:  Chet Cooper, Battelle/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Edward Frieman, Director Emeritus of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Vice Chancellor of the University of California; Nay Htun, United Nations Development Programme; Tom Lovejoy, Counselor to the Secretary for Biodiversity and Environmental Affairs, Smithsonian Institution; Per Pinstrup-Andersen, International Food Policy Research Institute; and Maurice Strong, Chairman of the Earth Council and former Secretary-General of the United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.  In addition, each episode will have two research scientists who are experts on specific disciplines being featured.  Outreach will be developed in association with the Chicago Academy of Sciences.\r\n\r\n",
