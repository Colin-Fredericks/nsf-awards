 "awd_abstract_narration": "While maintaining a vigorous chemistry research program involving under-graduate and graduate students, Dr. Lopez-Garriga also manages an extensive K-12 outreach agenda.  Through the Science on Wheels program, Lopez-Garriga has intrigued and excited thousands of elementary and secondary students by conducting simple experiments at K-12 schools throughout Puerto Rico. His undergraduate and graduate students helped Lopez-Garriga provide training in cooperative and active learning techniques to 500 K-12 teachers during the past eight years. In addition, 103 teachers enhanced their scientific competency through the GLOBE program (Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment). The Puerto Rico GLOBE franchise is headed by Lopez-Garriga.  Since 1990, Dr. Lopez-Garriga has mentored 35 graduate students of which eleven are currently pursuing doctoral degrees.  Lopez-Garriga is presently a member of the faculty at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez.\r\n\r\n",
