The project is led by two\r\nmathematicians and a physicist, and the award supports\r\npostdoctoral research fellows, graduate students, and the\r\ncollaborations and communications of a broadly based research\r\nnetwork.  The research program supported by this award\r\nconcentrates on dualities in string theory and M theory, a topic\r\nin which a broad range of geometric and physical concepts come\r\ntogether.  The best known of these dualities is mirror symmetry,\r\nwhich has had dramatic consequences for algebraic and symplectic\r\ngeometry, and this project intends to explore new dualities and\r\nconstraints along with mirror symmetry.\r\n\r\nString theory is a promising candidate for a unifying theory of\r\nthe universe at its most fundamental levels.  The basic idea is\r\nsimple - elementary particles should be modeled as mathematical\r\nloops of string rather than as points - but working out the\r\ndetails of this theory has involved and inspired some\r\nsophisticated mathematical tools and ideas.  Constraints and\r\nobservations from physics, sometimes posed as a claim that two\r\ndistinct geometries must generate the same physical theory, can\r\nhave large numbers of consequences for geometry since quantities\r\nof physical interest are often expressed as the average value of\r\nan observable quantity over space, or as a way of counting the\r\nnumber of times two objects meet.  The program in Algebra, Number\r\nTheory, and Combinatorics is cofunding this award.\r\n",
