 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses development of a new material for microwave electronics.  As microwave applications, including portable wireless devices, expand, and as digital integrated circuit speeds and clock rates increase to the millimeter wave (MMW) range, the need arises for a low-loss dimensionally stable dielectric with properties uniform over a broad range of frequencies and environmental conditions. The main challenge is to find a way of guiding MMW radiation through a dielectric substrate with minimal scattering losses, and of creating low-loss resonant cavities.\r\n\r\nWaveband Corporation proposes to develop a new technique to embed Photonic Band Gap Structures (PBSs) in ceramic substrates at an early stage of fabrication. The PBSs will reduce radiative losses in devices fabricated using the Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramic On Metal technique, by preventing radiation leakage and by minimizing undesired scattering. The PBSs will be embedded in the ceramic using well-developed fabrication methods. The result will be improved performance, without an increase in the manufacturing costs. Moreover, a PBS will lead to totally new applications: frequency-band controlled filters, perfect channel-drop filters, point-defect resonant cavities, linear-defect 90 degree waveguide bends, waveguide intersections with low crosstalk, and other.  The new material will be employed in high-volume production items for applications such as automotive electronics, medical electronics, as well as in a variety of portable wireless communication devices.\r\n\r\n",
