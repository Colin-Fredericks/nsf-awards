 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing award. This project addresses the need to assist humans in heavy materials handling, since such tasks expose the worker to known risk factors for work-related musculoskeletal disorders, such as lifting, bending, twisting, and maintenance of awkward postures. This project will study the use of cobots to implement ergonomic guiding surfaces to assist a human in the manipulation of a heavy load. With such a mechanism, the load can be constrained to move along a frictionless guide, and the human is allowed to apply forces in directions which are comfortable while the guide directs the motion to the goal. Cobots use rolling contacts to directly implement passive guiding constraints, and as a result they are safer to interact with and use less power than a conventional robot. To design assistive guide constraints, the project will study how humans naturally interact with constraints assuming that the essential nature of this interaction can be modeled by the human's desire to minimize some notion of effort.  With this model, The PIs will design guides that minimize the necessary human effort and will experimentally verify the correctness of the model.  The PIs will develop software for automatically planning near-optimal guides in cluttered workspaces and will test the guides using cobot hardware on realistic materials handling tasks. The resulted ergonomic virtual surfaces in materials handling will reduce the occurrence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. It will also increase productivity, providing an intuitive and safe interface between human and computer.  Finally, this work will expose new principles in human motor control, as the design of assistive guiding surfaces requires a better understanding of how humans interact with constraints.\r\n",
