 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\n\r\nGadsden State Community College (GSCC), in partnership with Auburn \r\nUniversity, is expanding its NSF-funded, one-year pilot program in order to improve aquatic science education at GSCC and in high schools located in rural East and West Alabama. The project: (1) allows existing educational resources to be used more efficiently; (2) increases the quality of aquatic science education in rural high schools; (3) increases the technical proficiency of secondary school teachers; (4) improves the technical quality and reputation of GSCC's Aquatic Sciences Program; and (5) increases recruitment, retention, and placement of students in technical careers in the aquatic sciences, especially the aquaculture industry. These goals are being achieved, in part, by installing recirculating systems in high schools. A core group of secondary teachers are participating in technical workshops. Self-sufficiency among teachers and their classes is being accelerated by the establishment of an electronic network with the focus on the improvement of aquatic science education and career preparation through distance education and locating intern positions for students within the private sector. Six high schools have a tilapia recirculating system and 20 secondary teachers have increased their technical knowledge and teaching capacity. GSCC has developed a 2-year terminal associate degree program and a transfer associate degree program in aquaculture technology. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
