 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to implement a state-of-the-art photoluminescence capability to extend the PIs   semiconductor characterization capabilities and to provide an important tool in undergraduate education; it will be used in undergraduate laboratory projects for a special materials science course. The PI has established a research program in exploring materials issues of semiconductor thin film growth focused on microstructural, morphological, and compositional evolution in III-V semiconductor alloys. This project will allow correlation of microstructural, morphological, and compositional phenomena to optoelectronic properties.  \r\n%%% \r\nThis is a research enhancement grant made under the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE) program. The POWRE grant will maintain and raise her visi-bility in the very competitive and male-dominated field of semiconductor and microelectronic re-search by branching her research into the realm of optical characterization and device applica-tions. The research is expected to contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level of special relevance to the behavior of electronic/photonic materials, and to assist with the integration of research and education. The project is co-supported by the Division of Materials Research, and the MPS OMA(Office of Multidisciplinary Activities). \r\n***\r\n",
