Each workshop will be one week long, concentrating on theoretical issues in macroeconomics and dynamic economic modeling.  These workshops continue the workshop series held from 1987 to 1999 at Northwestern University. Except for the change in location, this series is very similar to the previous one.  The topics for the three years vary. Areas that look promising for the 2000 workshop include: theoretical and computational methods for analyzing government policy in the absence of commitment; macroeconomic consequences of contracting frictions; and searching and matching models of labor market dynamics.  The topics for the second and third years of the workshop series will be decided at a later date. Areas likely to be included are: the role of financial constraints in affecting the entry, growth, and exit of firms; theoretical and computational methods for analyzing models with heterogeneous agent; political economy issues in the choice of aggregate policy; and the role of financial markets in business cycle fluctuations.\r\n",
