 "awd_abstract_narration": "Patrick E. Hoggard of the University of Santa Clara is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for research on photoreversible systems.  Certain photosensitive systems exhibit the unusual property of switching between two grossly different states (one predominantly product, the other predominantly reactant) on slight perturbation.  This is interpreted as indicating that the forward and reverse reactions involve different mechanisms. This phenomenon will be studied in Ru(bpy)2Cl2 systems, and other systems with this property will be sought for.\r\n\r\nSwitching between two states of quite different properties is important in a number of technologically and scientifically important areas. The systems of interest in this proposal involve both photochemical activation and sensitivity to changes in adjustable parameters, such as the nature of the solvent. This research aims at  increased understanding of presently known model systems. That increase in  understanding may well lead to development of new and useful photochemical systems and devices, as well as to progress in theoretical  comprehension.",
