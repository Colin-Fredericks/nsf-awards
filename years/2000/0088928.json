If p is 1 such a space is the  predual of von Neumann \r\nalgebra and reflects important properties of the underlying \r\noperator algebra. We recall, that it is still open whether \r\npreduals of von Neumann are finitely represented in the space of \r\ntrace class operators. Here, we focus on isometric characterization \r\nof finite dimensional spaces embedding into the predual of a von \r\nNeumann algebra and its connection to the theory of Lie-algebras \r\nand (non-commutative) stochastical processes. The investigation of \r\nthe latter uses  martingale inequalities based on recent progress \r\nby Pisier and Xu. We are interested in the non-commutative version \r\nof the  Rosenthal/Burkholder inequality and Doob's maximal inequality. \r\nMaximal inequalities are also known as a useful tool in (stochastical) \r\nanalysis. The more recent theory of operator spaces delivers the \r\nright framework for these investigations and reveals surprising \r\nproperties of the non-commutative space of p-integrable functions \r\nassociated to free groups. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNon-commutative probability provides  one possible framework \r\nfor the probabilistic viewpoint in quantum mechanics. This theory\r\ncombines fundamental concepts of algebraic nature with analytic\r\ninsight and methods with roots in calculus. The non-commutative \r\nanalogue for the spaces of p-integrable functions has a long \r\ntradition in the theory of operator algebras and provides a \r\nfruitful framework for understanding  classical  tools in \r\nprobability. It is most challenging to reveal or overcome \r\nsubstantial differences between the commutative and non-\r\ncommutative theory. This area enables the interaction between \r\ndifferent streams inside  the mathematical community and \r\nmathematical physics. This kind of interaction is one of the most \r\nimportant resources for new development in mathematics\r\n",
