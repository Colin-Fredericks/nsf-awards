 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will investigate vertex operator algebras\r\nand their automorphism groups. Holomorphic orbifold theory, and\r\nrational vertex operator algebras will be studied. Relation among\r\nvertex operator algebras, automorphism groups of vertex operator\r\nalgebras, quantum doubles, dual pairs will be discussed.  The\r\nautomorphism group of a rational vertex operator algebra will be\r\ndetermined. Certain rational vertex operator algebras will be\r\ncharacterized and classified. Several fundamental problems in the theory \r\nof vertex operator algebra are expected to be solved. The goal of\r\nthis project is to lay some further foundations of the theory of vertex\r\noperator algebras and their representations. \r\n\r\nString theory at present is the only candidate for a theory combining all \r\nthe fundamental interactions. Two dimensional conformal field theory\r\nwhich is an important physical theory describing two-dimensional\r\ncritical phenomena in condensed matter physics provides a framework for \r\nstring theory. Vertex operator algebras are symmetry algebras in conformal \r\nfield theory. Physical theories, perhaps more often than mathematical theories,\r\ntypically start from particular structure, called the models. On the\r\nother hand, mathematical theories abstract from the examples and predict\r\nwhat happens in general.  This is a research that\r\nstarts out in the field of algebra but moves beyond that to touch\r\ninvariant theory, quantum groups, modular forms, and conformal and \r\ntopological field theories. A successful study of this project will \r\nlead to new mathematical discoveries which will be important both in \r\nmathematics and physics.",
