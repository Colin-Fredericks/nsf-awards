 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research on inorganic fullerene chemistry by Professor Alan Balch of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California-Davis. A number of fullerene derivatives, both endohedral and dimeric, will be synthesized. The x-ray structures of fullerenes which are co-crystallized with transition metal complexes will be determined. These new supramolecular compounds will also be examined for interesting physical properties, particularly magnetism and redox activity. New, redox active films which consist of fullerenes covalently bonded to transition metal centers, metal-ligand complexes or metal clusters will be prepared by means of an electrochemical reduction process. The films will subsequently be investigated by a variety of physical measurements to determine their charge transport and storage characteristics and nanostructural features.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to explore the inorganic chemistry of fullerenes, a new form of carbon discovered a little over a decade ago. The combination of fullerenes with metal ions and complexes will lead to new crystalline compounds and films with potentially important applications. These materials may find use as battery and microelectronic components, chemical sensors, and catalysts. Students at all levels, undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral, will be provided with both broad scientific training and good communication skills through their involvement with this project. \r\n",
