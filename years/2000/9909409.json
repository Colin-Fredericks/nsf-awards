The World Media Foundation is now adding environmental science and technology features to \"Living on Earth\" and is developing and testing an outreach component that will involve youth as researchers and radio producers.   The science and technology features, ranging in length from four to twenty-four minutes, will depart from the usual news-driven reports on the programs.  Many of the segments will illustrate basic building blocks of environmental science, technology and related mathematics.  Others will profile diverse pioneers in these disciplines.  \r\n\r\nThe radio programs will be the framework for an interdisciplinary exploration program for youth.  Working with a team of educators from the Antioch University Graduate Program in Environmental Education, the project staff will develop a program in which secondary school aged youth cooperate with peers to produce professional, concise reporting on local environmental issues.  Living on Earth will feature the best of the student work on National Public Radio and highlight these pieces as an expanded feature on its website.\r\n",
