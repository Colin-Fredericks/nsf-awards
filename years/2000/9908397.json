 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies basic processing skills involved in learning to speak\r\na second language (L2). The special focus of this work is sentence\r\nproduction in learners of Japanese as a second language. For L2 learners\r\nto become proficient speakers, they must have more than passive knowledge\r\nof words and grammatical rules (e.g., that used in reading). They must\r\nlearn to use their knowledge to rapidly build new sentences. Because\r\nJapanese has structures that are fundamentally different from English (the\r\nnative language (L1) of the L2 learners in this study), transfer from L1\r\nto L2 is difficult and we can better evaluate new production skills.  Two\r\nprocesses essential to fluent production are: fast, accurate word\r\nretrieval and access to the grammatical structures in which words can\r\nappear. These are examined in two steps.\r\n\r\n- First, native Japanese speakers performance is examined to establish\r\npatterns of fluent L1 production. Two modes of evaluation are used: (1)\r\nretrieval of the grammatical information linked to words is studied in\r\nexperimentally elicited \"tip of the tongue\" states; (2) grammatical\r\nprocesses that select case particle words (e.g., subject-marker ga and\r\nobject-marker o) are analyzed in naturally occurring and experimentally\r\nelicited speech errors.\r\n \r\n- Second, \"L2 knowledge\" for learners of Japanese is examined. L2 speakers\r\nof different proficiency levels participate in multiple tasks; some tasks\r\nprovide data reflecting grammatical knowledge (e.g., sentence judgment\r\ntasks, fill-in-the-blank tests), while others elicit use of grammatical\r\nknowledge (e.g., case particles) during speech. The gap between L2\r\nspeakers knowledge and oral performance is examined to reveal their\r\nsentence production processes. This is compared to the L1 data patterns.\r\n\r\nResults of these studies will shed light on basic mechanisms common across\r\nlanguages and on language-specific processes that Japanese L2 learners\r\nmust acquire. As we better understand such language performance, we also\r\ngain information that may improve foreign language instruction.",
