 "awd_abstract_narration": "0080197\r\nREH\r\n\r\nThe Neurons and Photoreceptors in eyes are organized in regular arrays.  The regular arrays of neurons in ten retina of the eye are like the pixels of a computer screen or video camera; they allow information to be arranged spatially in the nervous system, which is critical for the operation of the visual system.  It is not known how these arrays arise during development.  Imagining how difficult it would be for a video camera to assemble itself gives some idea of the fundamental mystery of this process.  The purpose of the proposed experiments is to determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms that pattern the first neurons in vertebrate retina.  These first neurons develop as a patterned array that spreads from the central to peripheral retina as a wave front of differentiation.  It is proposed to further study the process of pattern formation in the retina by addressing the following questions: 1.  Is the recently identified proneural Cath5 gene involved in the control of the spacing of the retinal ganglion cells at the front of differentiation?  2.  Does the growth factor FGF regulate expression of the proneural gene Cath5? 3.  Does FGF-15 control the onset of ganglion cell differentiation? 4.  Does Cath5 co-ordinate ganglion cell differentiation?  These studies will provide fundamental about the mechanisms by which patterned arrays of neurons are established in the vertebrate central nervous system.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the human nervous system is the most complicated system in the Universe.  The current understanding of this complex machine is still fragmentary; however, it has recently been recognized that those who study the nervous system are studying a \"moving target\"-the nervous system is a machine that has constructed itself, and is constantly changing.  It would be as if a computer was constantly rewiring part of its circuitry every day to adapt to the changing world.  The proposed research will help to understand how such a complex system arises during the development of every person, and how this complexity is maintained and refined throughout a lifetime.\r\n",
