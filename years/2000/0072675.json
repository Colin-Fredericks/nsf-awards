Freed\r\n\r\nThe geometry group at the University of Texas proposes to carry\r\nout a variety of research projects, most of which are related to\r\nphysics.  Dan Freed's current research focuses on questions in\r\ngeometry and topology arising from string theory.  These include\r\nthe construction of determinant line bundles on manifolds with\r\nboundary and the understanding of anomalies of actions which\r\narise in quantizing lagrangian field theories.  Karen Uhlenbeck's\r\ncurrent research involves the geometric theory of integrable\r\nsystems, as well as a non-linear Schroedinger equation arising in\r\nmacroscopic theories of a ferro-magnetic continuum. These two\r\nresearchers are starting a project aimed at understanding the\r\nappearance of integrable systems in conformal field theories.\r\nBob Williams is applying his expertise on attractors to the\r\nconstruction of tiling spaces.  Constantin Teleman is pursuing\r\nseveral projects in the cohomology of infinite dimensional Lie\r\nAlgebras. He and his coworkers are making progress on the\r\nMacDonald conjectures, and are also giving geometric\r\ninterpretations in terms of the Hodge cohomology of flag\r\nvarieties of loop groups.  He is also interested in homotopy\r\nequivalences between holomorphic and continuous mapping\r\nspaces. Postdoctoral members of the group are Nurit Krausz, who\r\nis working on direct computations for quantum field theory in\r\nMinkowski space, and Adrian Vajiac who uses equivariant\r\nlocalization techniques to study topological quantum field\r\ntheories.\r\n\r\nAt this point in time, geometry is a rapidly developing area of\r\nmathematics.  While research in geometry, like most of pure\r\nmathematics, consists of the construction and development of\r\nabstract concepts, the origins and ultimate applications for\r\nthese constructions are invariably examples and applications in\r\nmore applied fields. The influence of theoretical physics on\r\ngeometry is strong.  For example, large numbers of geometers are\r\ncurrently working on questions related to quantum groups, mirror\r\nsymmetry and quantum cohomology. Our group attempts not to work\r\non problems which have already been identified by mathematicians\r\nas central, but in contrast we look at current ideas in physics\r\nof all sorts and then find, clarify, and work on the\r\nmathematically interesting questions more directly.  Dan Freed's\r\nwork on string theory connects the physics ideas of quantization\r\nwith the mathematical subject of algebraic topology.  His joint\r\nproject with Karen Uhlenbeck on the appearance of integrable\r\nsystems in certain quantum field theories requires an\r\nunderstanding of field theory, integrable systems, and the very\r\nimportant and basic ideas of symmetry.  Constantin Teleman's work\r\ndeeply involves fundamental ideas of symmetry, as well as delving\r\ninto the question of how closely very messy functions can be\r\napproximated qualitatively by polynomial-like objects. Some of\r\nthe geometric ideas come from other branches of physics, such as\r\nthe ferro-magnetic equations studied by Uhlenbeck.  The tiling\r\nspaces of William's come from beautiful examples such as those\r\nconstructed by Roger Penrose.  Our efforts bring new ideas and\r\ntechniques into mathematics, rather than concentrating on\r\nprojects which are already popular.\r\n",
