 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) Molecular modeling tools are being used to integrate topics in quantum chemistry and thermodynamics across the curriculum. By focusing on molecules and employing computational power in both visualization and manipulation and in the calculation of molecular properties, physical chemistry topics presented in introductory, organic, physical, and biochemistry are  unified.  Additionally, students are being educated both in the use of computers within the field of chemistry, and in the theories upon which these methods are based. Materials are adapted from recent educational literature sources employing this integrative curriculum mode.  Beginning with introductory courses (for both science majors and non-majors), molecular modeling exercises emphasizing the three-dimensional geometry of molecules and the idea of electronic wave functions  introduce students to a computer program (the Spartan family of programs) that they can use throughout the chemistry curriculum.  In organic chemistry, students use more sophisticated techniques to study the energetics of molecular conformations and to explore the role of electronic structure in chemical reactivity. The physical chemistry course uses molecular modeling techniques and describes the theoretical basis of these methods (including a discussion of their limitations and shortcomings). Students receive the immediate opportunity to apply their knowledge in a new biochemistry course that is required of all majors.  This effort provides a model for the continued expansion of computational methods into the remainder of the chemistry curriculum, as well as the introduction of similar technologies into the biology department (e.g., bioinformatics tools). Other benefits of this project include the availability of computer resources to be shared with the department of Mathematics & Computer Science, as well as an outreach program to local high schools whereby students and teachers have the opportunity to use the molecular modeling facility developed in the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
