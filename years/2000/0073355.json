This conference is the successor to the first such conference, held in Japan three years ago.  It brings together about 200 researchers from Asia and the US, as well as Europe.  Both academic and industrial researchers will participate in sessions on materials, characterization, simulation, theoretical models, equilibrium, kinetics, applications, and processes.\r\n\r\nAdsorption is a key phenomenon in many separation and catalytic processes as well as in nature, and the current research activity is dynamic, stimulated by new developments in materials synthesis, molecular modeling, and specific applications.  Much of the important new work is being done abroad, especially in Japan, so it is vital that U.S. researchers maintain contact and collaboration with their foreign counterparts.  This conference provides an opportunity to promote such contact.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
