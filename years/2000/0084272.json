Gogotsi, University of Illinois at Chicago\r\n\r\nThe processes which govern fluid processes in pipes are well understood for diameters in the range of micrometers and above. As the diameters diminish ( e.g. in the range of a few nanometers), the role of surface tension and capillarity  is has been seen to change, as well as their dependence on material properties. Thus, the expected promise of  Carbon nanotubes in technological applications is in urgent need of a well documented basic understanding of such forces, especially since no consistent experimental data  have  been collected so far.\r\n   The PI has obtained  preliminary results in the determination of the liquid/vapor distribution in nanotubes, with the help of  transmission  electron spectroscopy. On that basis , he offers to develop an experimental program which will explore as thoroughly as possible the various aspects of phase interfacing in a number  of  nanotube  situations. The special case of the newly developed closed nanotubes will be examined . Such work should offer a precious set of data for the elaboration of a  model based on precise experimental observations.\r\n",
