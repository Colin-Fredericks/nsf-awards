 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research program entitled \"Chemical Reactions of Environmental and Atmospheric Relevance on the Surface of Oxide Particles\"  will be performed by Dr. Vicki Grassian from the University of Iowa and is jointly supported by the Atmospheric Chemistry and Analytical and Surface Chemistry Programs.  The goal of this project is to study the heterogeneous surface chemistry occurring on oxide particles.  Of particular interest is the influence of adsorbed water on the adsorption and reaction kinetics of nitric acid, sulfur dioxide and ozone.  Spectroscopic and kinetic measurements will be made on these complex systems.  \r\n\r\nGas phase reactions occuring in the atmosphere are frequently catalyzed at the surface of particulates which exist in suspended aerosols.  In particular, the most abundant particulates include the oxides of silicon, aluminum and iron.  This research into the fundamental gas phase reactions occuring at the surfaces of oxide particles will have direct impact on the understanding of  atmospheric processes.  The data obtained will be useful for global atmospheric chemistry models and for developing environmental catalysts for the reduction of hazardous chemicals.",
