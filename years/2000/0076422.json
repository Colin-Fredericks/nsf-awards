New atomic-scale spectroscopic probes of materials properties will be developed.  These will advance the state-of-the-art in the ability to measure and carry chemical fingerprinting of materials surfaces  at this scale.  These will impact industrial, government, and academic research both via broad dissemination and more directly through extensive network of collaborations and beyond.  Specifically, the new tool will allow local measurements to study materials in the optical, microwave, and acoustic regimes with unprecedented resolution.  These new capabilities will also be exploited to measure one particle, molecule, or surface site at a time, so as to elucidate the intrinsic materials properties, as distinct from the average properties of heterogeneous mixtures. It will be possible to target structures and properties of interest for more precise synthesis and separation. The University will make these new measurement tools and techniques widely available.  Integral to this development effort is training students, post-docs, visitors, and collaborators in how to create, to optimize, and to evaluate new instruments of this type. \r\n \r\n\r\nThis instrument development award to Pennsylvania State University, University Park is jointly made by the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program, and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities program.
