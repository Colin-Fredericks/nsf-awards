The award goes to integrate the research and education aspects of his career plan.  In research, he plans to carry out studies in three different projects: (1) to construct new measures to characterize the image data obtained in experiments on turbulent fluid flow and turbulent advection.  (2) A study of simple lattice models of globular proteins to develop a theory of secondary structure and to study phase transitions between different compact states.  The final project consists of (3) theoretical understanding of the role played by critical percolation clusters in localization of electrons in the quantum Hall effect.  In education, there are plans to develop a course on the idea of an effective theory as a universal paradigm.  This approach, transcending over the conventional divisions of a subject explores the evolution of physical phenomena over different length and time scales.\r\n%%%\r\nThe young, new member of the Brandeis University physics department is being supported by this CAREER grant for integration of research and education in his career plans.  He plans to teach a course on effective theory, i.e. methods and models- how does one develop a theory for a given physical phenomena.  His research is all on geometric aspects of statistical mechanics.  He wants to provide a measure to an image of a turbulent process.  He wants to study globular proteins and their secondary structures.  He also wants to study the meandering pathways through which an electron moves, as a study in a description of thresholds in quantum Hall effect.\r\n***      \r\n",
