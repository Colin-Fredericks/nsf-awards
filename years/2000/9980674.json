 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\nMultidisciplinary, project-based education is a major hallmark of the engineering curriculum under development at the newly created College of Engineering at Rowan University. The common 8-semester clinic sequence is inherently multidisciplinary since it is taken simultaneously by all engineering students. However, multidisciplinary teams in industry are usually comprised of non-technical as well as technical personnel. To encourage the creation of multidisciplinary teams that contain both engineering and liberal arts majors, project topics must be created that appeal to a wide audience. Music is a topic that inherently unites college age students regardless of their major, ethnicity, religion or sex. The Creative Audio Technology Environment (CREATE) capitalizes on the unifying theme of music to encourage creation of diverse product development teams made up of engineers and music and other liberal arts students.\r\n\r\nThe Creative Audio Technology Environment (CREATE) at Rowan University is a multidisciplinary audio development studio and laboratory wherein students from three different colleges within the university collaborate on innovative audio design projects. Housed in a dedicated facility within the Department of Music but shared equally among students and faculty from engineering, music and physics, CREATE contains a dedicated 24-channel mixing console and audio recording equipment consisting of an 8-track ADAT, DAT, analog cassette and CD recorders. The development studio also contains microphones, audio effects processors, amplifiers, monitors and an HP spectrum analyzer.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the Creative Audio Technology Environment at Rowan University are to: 1. Provide students with a state-of-the-art audio development studio to encourage rapid product development of audio related products, 2. Introduce engineering students to the importance of considering the customer (e.g., music students) to develop a quality product that meets desired customer attributes, 3. Promote the profession of engineering, not only to engineering students, but to liberal and fine arts students as well, by allowing a diverse student body to take part in a product development endeavor with music as the underlying theme, a theme which inherently unites students and faculty alike, 4. Provide a laboratory to teach the scientific principles of music and sound to a multidisciplinary audience.\r\n\r\nThe proposed CreATE laboratory is an adaptation and implementation of several existing courses and laboratory programs throughout the country (Miami, WPI, Georgia Tech and KSU) which have used audio related projects as a means of presenting principles of electronics, sound and vibration, and product development.  The major program example from which ideas and materials are adapted is that of Kansas State University.  The CreATE laboratory combines the best aspects of this program (and others) and enhances the multidisciplinary component by ensuring that there is an active, regular interaction with students and faculty in the music department.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
