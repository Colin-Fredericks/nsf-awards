 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe Salish Kootenai College Rural Systemic Initiative (SKC RSI-Phase II) will result in a\r\ntransformation of the educational experience for both teachers and students. Professional\r\ndevelopment for teachers, adoption of effective assessment strategies, and promotion of \r\ncommunity involvement in the educational process will enhance the quality and quantity of the\r\nlearning experience for students in science, mathematics, and technology within and beyond the\r\nschool walls.  The classroom teacher is the key to the effectiveness of the delivery of curricular\r\nchanges to the individual student. In the SKC RSI project, the primary goal is to have every\r\nteacher achieve the status of \"master teacher\" and to have every student achieve the status \r\nof \"master learner.\"  It is important to understand that the journey of the educational experience \r\nIs a balanced effort between teachers and students.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this proposal is to implement a comprehensive, sustainable, adaptable\r\nsystem-wide reform of science, mathematics and technology instruction and learning on the\r\nFlathead Indian Reservation in Montana. This will lead to increased achievement for all students\r\nand specifically emphasizes greater achievements for two groups of under-served populations in\r\nthis rural setting: Native American students and girls.  \r\n\r\nSKC is the resource identifier for science, mathematics, and technology areas and has\r\nalready developed coursework in biology, chemistry, physics, and earth sciences. SKC will, in\r\neffect, become a \"mini clearinghouse\" for science, mathematics, and technology (SMT) areas\r\nusing American Indian-specific teaching and learning materials in professional development\r\nin SMT areas for teachers and students. SKC is currently preparing assessment strategies\r\nand activities that will be shared with other TCRSI projects.\r\n\r\nOther major goals are the improvement of science, mathematics, and technology education\r\non the Flathead Indian Reservation including access to high quality, standards-based \r\ninstruction for all students, innovative use of educational technologies for interactive delivery\r\nand the training of the teaching workforce to meet the demands of a new instructional\r\nparadigm. Rigorous, standards-based instruction for all students will be implemented on the\r\nFlathead Indian Reservation and the curriculum, professional development, and assessment\r\nsystems to support that instruction. The development of the policy changes and resource\r\nallocations to support these efforts are the long-term goal of the SKC RSI Program.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
