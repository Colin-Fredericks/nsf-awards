 "awd_abstract_narration": "The department of chemistry is improving and modernizing the                    undergraduate laboratory curriculum.  Specifically, the department is           introducing NMR spectroscopy into the \"project lab\" chemistry courses.          \"Project lab\" is the department's unique approach to laboratory                 instruction which emphasizes individual achievement and preparedness in         the chemistry laboratory.  With the many applications of NMR                    spectroscopy the department is implementing NMR experiments in all              areas of chemistry.  Experiments are being introduced into the                  undergraduate lab which are unique to the NMR phenomenon.  Ultimately           the department would like to publish some of these experiments to               assist other undergraduate institutions in fully utilizing their NMR            instructional facilities.  The specific piece of equipment that is              being utilized is a 60 MHz spectrometer equipped with a variable                temperature probe.                                                                                                                                              The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.",
