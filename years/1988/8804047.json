 "awd_abstract_narration": "The energy-consuming biological nitrogen fixation process is                    essential for a positive input of usable nitrogen on earth.                     The ATP-dependent evolution of hydrogen by nitrogenase                          results in a considerable loss of energy from the nitrogen                      fixation process.  However, the evolved hydrogen can be                         recycled via an hydrogen oxidizing electron transport system.                   The cytochrome components involved in hydrogen oxidation and                    the role they play in protecting nitrogenase from oxygen                        damage, and supplying ATP to nitrogenase are poorly                             understood.  This research uses mutant analyses approaches                      toward understanding and assessing the roles of terminal                        oxidases in nitrogen fixation and various substrate                             oxidations using Azotobacter vinelandii.  The approaches                        include the isolation and characterization of mutants with                      deletions in cytochrome o and d genes.%%%                                                                                                                       Increasing world population combined with dwindling fuel                        reserves makes increased dependence on nitrogen fixation                        likely.  Since most experts believe that the nitrogen                           fixation process is energy (ATP) limited, factors that result                   in efficient use of otherwise wasted energy (such as                            hydrogen) deserve research attention.  Hydrogen oxidation by                    the bacterium Azotobacter has been shown to allow the                           nitrogen fixing enzyme to function optimally.  The study of                     hydrogen-oxidizing electron transport and its regulation                        shows promise for increasing nitrogen fixation.***//",
