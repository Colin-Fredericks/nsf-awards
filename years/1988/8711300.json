 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the deep structure of continental margins is              critical in determining the processes by which new ocean basins                 are formed during continental rifting, in evaluating the response               of the continental crust to thermal events which accompany                      rifting, and in comparing volcanic and sedimentary events which                 precede and post date rifting events. The East Coast of the U.S.                has had a complex geologic history which includes at least two                  stages of rifting and a major period of continental suturing.                   Much of this history is preserved in the deep, sedimentary strata               along the continental margin.                                                           The objective of the present project is to use seismic                  reflection profiling and refraction data to acoustically image                  these deep sedimentary layers. These data can then be interpreted               to understand the geologic history of the East Coast as well as                 the processes which accompany stretching and uplift of                          continental crust during rifting of continental masses. Data will               be acquired through lease of a commercially available seismic                   ship and deployment of ocean bottom seismometers off the                        southeast coast of the US.",
