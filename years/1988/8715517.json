 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program will support research in the area of                          organometallic chemistry. The project is expected to provide                    fundamental information about the chemical bonds which hold                     together the atoms of hydrogen-containing organometallic                        compounds. Such compounds are important catalysts for the                       industrial synthesis of organic compounds.                                                                                                                      This project will use three solid-state deuterium NMR                           techniques to study bonding in organometallic compounds                         involving bonds of the types M-H, M-H-M, M-(dihydrogen),                        M-(methylene)-M, as well as transition metal activated C-H                      bonds. Correlations between molecular and electronic structures                 and variations in the solid-state NMR spectra will be                           established by molecular orbital calculations on model                          complexes. One of the solid-state NMR techniques, ADLF                          spectroscopy, will be used to acquire high-resolution,                          solid-state deuterium NMR spectra of adsorbed species on                        surfaces. The goal of the research is to evaluate solid-state                   deuterium NMR spectroscopy as a technique for fundamental                       studies of organometallic complexes and surface adsorbed                        species. The anticipated benefits to solution and surface                       chemistry include determining the structure of metal-hydrogen                   bonds and the electronic charge resident on reactive carbon                     sites.",
