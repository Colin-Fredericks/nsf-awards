 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to continue investigating the temporal Pb                     isotope variation in the Tertiary plateau basalts and central                   volcanic complexes from Iceland, the prototype of a ridge-                      centered hot spot.  This study is aimed towards interpreting the                geological history of the Iceland plume, as well as the                         relationship between hotspots, mantle heterogeneity and mantle                  geodynamics in general.  The study of temporal geochemical                      variations associated with plume volcanism can constrain plume                  dynamics and interaction between the plume and the surrounding                  mantle.  The Pb isotope variation so far established for the                    Tertiary plateau basalts requires 3-component mixing, and the                   relative contributions of these three components are not random                 but change regularly and systematically with time.  The proposed                research will focus on establishing how processes of magma                      formation, migration and storage at shallow depths affect isotope               variations during a limited period of time in the geologic past.",
