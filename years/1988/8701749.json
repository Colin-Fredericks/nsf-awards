 "awd_abstract_narration": "Titanium hydride can be reacted with ammonia in the                        presence of various metal catalysts to form titanium nitride.                   When the kinetics of this reaction were analyzed by                             thermogravimetric analysis, the weight change versus time                       curves showed a number of reproducible discontinuities which                    did not correspond to expected kinetic behavior.  Earlier Phase                 I research indicated that the discontinuities were due to the                   effects of multiple catalysts.  A preliminary kinetic mechanism                 was proposed which will be more fully investigated in this                      Phase II research.  Various metal catalysts will be analyzed                    for their effectiveness not only in promoting the nitriding                     reaction but also for catalyzing the reaction of titanium                       hydride with methane.  Contact angle measurements for various                   nickel alloys on titanium nitride were evaluated in Phase I.                    In Phase II, these measurements will be extended, and the                       nickel alloy-titanium nitride interface will be investigated to                 determine the causes for enhanced wetting.  Cermets of nickel                   alloy and titanium nitride will be made by cold pressing and                    sintering.  The physical properties of the cermets will be                      correlated with contact angle measurements, as well as other                    microstructural features.                                                            Premium high speed steel and cemented carbide cutting                      tools are currently coated with combinations of titanium                        nitride, titanium carbide, and alumina.  Titanium nitride is                    the most popular coating for the actual wear surface.  With                     feasibility established in Phase I, the opportunity exists in                   Phase II to correlate wetting with physical properties and                      confirm the catalytic mechanism for producing titanium nitride.                 A fundamental understanding and improvement of the synthesis                    and wetting of titanium nitride by a nickel binder is expected                  to lead to a cermet with significantly enhanced physical                        properties.  Such a cermet may replace tungsten carbide-cobalt                  tools in some applications, reducing the dependence of the                      United States on imported cobalt.",
