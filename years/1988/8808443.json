 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this proposed research is to induce a                  significant increase in the viscosity of liquid carbon dioxide by               dissolving small amounts of chemical compounds which may aggregate in           the fluid phase and form long macromolecule-like structures.  Three             types of compounds will be evaluated using a novel, high pressure,              visual falling cylinder viscometer and a high pressure PVT apparatus.           Various oil soluble nonionic and semi-fluorinated surfactants will be           dissolved in carbon dioxide along with small amounts of water, in an            attempt to form long, cylindrical reverse micelles and microemulsions.          Semi-fluorinated alkanes constitute the second category of candidate            compounds.  Finally, tri-n-butyltin fluoride and a cosolvent will be            introduced into the liquid carbon dioxide.                                                                                                                      Increasing the viscosity of carbon dioxide may be of value in                   developing displacement media in oil reservoirs where current low               viscosity carbon dioxide solutions lead to by-passing or channeling             and low recovery efficiencies.  An understanding of surfactant                  behavior in supercritical fluids may also lead to new separation and            purification processes combining surfactant technology and                      supercritical fluid technology.",
