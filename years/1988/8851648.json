 "awd_abstract_narration": "The questions being asked by today's scientists are moving them                 steadily into realms where rapid acquisition of data is commonplace,            and where sophisticated and detailed analysis is required to make these         data sensible.  Exposure to the uses and applications of the tools              required to engage in this work is becoming an increasing necessity in          the undergraduate preparation of young scientists.  The microcomputer           with its potential for interfacing to instruments and apparatus is a            central tool in this process.  It is the aim of this project to                 provide, for chemistry majors, meaningful instruction in and experience         with computer interfacing in laboratory environments.  Six computer             interfacing units are being purchased to be used in six different               laboratory courses distributed over the last three undergraduate                years.  The project is providing an early introduction to computer              interfacing, with units appropriately configured for use by                     inexperienced students.  Uses and applications are building in                  sophistication as students move into more advanced laboratory                   situations.  Chemistry majors are engaging in multiple experiences with         these tools and techniques, and it is estimated that seventy new                students per year are being exposed to the techniques.
