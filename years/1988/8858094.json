Emphasis is placed on neural networks and parallel computation                  models, specifically, studying the implementation of learning                   algorithms, number representation including analog, digital and                 bipolar numbers, and new optical architectures and architectural                issues such as hardware and time complexity, uniformity, and                    energy requirements.  Some of the neural network architectures                  developed are being demonstrated experimentally.  Finally,                      optical or hybrid optical/electronic architectures based on                     parallel computation models are being developed.  These include                 an analysis of run-time performance of fundamental algorithms on                the new architectures, hardware and device requirements for their               physical realization, and experimental demonstrations of some of                the architectures.",
