 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. William C. Agosta of the Rockefeller                    University to collaborate with Dr. Paul Margaretha of the University            of Hamburg.  They have a mutual interest and complementary expertise            in the chemistry of alkyl propargyl biradicals, and their joint work            emphasizes novel mechanistic studies and new methods of forming                 these species.  The small Rockefeller group is composed primarily of            postdoctoral workers, and has expertise in general mechanistic                  organic photochemistry and the synthesis and characterization of                small ring compounds.  The larger Hamburg group offers expertise in             quantitative measurement and the kinetics of radical reactions,                 electrochemistry and organofluorine chemistry.  Because of a larger             number of graduate students, it is better able to carry out studies             requiring greater manpower.  They have collaborated very                        productively for several years under NATO sponsorship.  Under                   support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) they will                    collaborate in studies of the mechanism of hydrogen migration in                carbene, the independent propagation of carbene 2, the                          photochemistry of ketone 15a and exploratory intramolecular                     reactions leading to alkyl propargyl biradicals.                                                                                                                This cooperative arrangement will enhance Dr. Agosta's domestic                 research which is directed at understanding structural and                      stereochemical control factors in organic photochemical reaction                mechanisms, and using controlled photochemical processes for the                construction of novel organic ring systems of theoretical and                   structural interest.",
