 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aller will use the Hamilton echelle spectrograph at Lick                        Observatory to obtain spectra of planetary nebulae at high                      dispersion and with a broad wavelength coverage.  The goal is to                measure the intensities of spectral lines that previously were too              faint and/or too blended with other lines.  This should yield                   accurate chemical compositions for a small sample of bright                     nebulae for which much complementary information has already been               obtained in other wavelength ranges.                                                                                                                            Planetary nebulae are gaseous nebulae that have been expelled from              aging stars.  The nebulae contain the elements generated within                 the stars and thus inform us of stellar nucleosynthesis during an               important but otherwise inaccessible phase of a star's life.                    Aller will use a new spectrograph at Lick Observatory to observe                selected planetary nebulae, specifically to measure accurately                  much fainter spectrum lines than has been possible heretofore.                  This will yield greatly improved stellar chemical abundances and,               simultaneously, much new atomic information not obtainable in the               laboratory.",
