 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ecology of lakes and ponds depends strongly on the                  activity of zooplankton, small swimming animals about the size of               a grain of rice.  These animals are a main part of the diet of                  young fish.  They also keep natural waters clean of algae.                      \u001aDaphnia\u001a occupy a key position in the food chain of lakes.  They               are the main animal that passes energy from algae to fish.  When                \u001aDaphnia\u001a are scarce, water quality suffers.  Recent research on                the biology of these small but key organisms suggests that their                swimming behavior and where they live in a lake depend partly on                biochemical compounds produced by fish and other predators.  Dr.                Dodson's research plans to identify at least one of the                         chemicals and test the ability of \u001aDaphnia\u001a to avoid predators                  based on detection of these chemicals.  This research will  also                have relevance for management of aquatic resources, such as those               situations in which game fish are stocked into lakes in order to                have the ultimate effect of increasing the abundance of                         zooplankton and reducing the amount of algae.",
