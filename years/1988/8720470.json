 "awd_abstract_narration": "Guidelines for the design of information presentation formats in                computer-based decision support systems (DSS) are developed.  The               contingent relationship between decision strategies and the structure           of the decision environment provides a framework for analyzing the              impact of DSS design alternatives on different decision strategies.             The cognitive costs and benefits of different display formats are               evaluated, particularly with respect to the cognitive effort required           to implement various decision strategies and the accuracy of the                resulting decision.  Simulation techniques are used to provide specific         predictions of how changes in DSS design will influence behavior.               Experimental observations of decision behavior are used to validate the         analysis.  The significance of this line of research is two-fold:               First, the results can provide guidance to researchers and                      practitioners interested in the design and implementation of computer-          based decision aids, ultimately improving the effectiveness of those            aids.  Second, this research provides an extension of an area of basic          research on the psychology of decision making into an important applied         domain.",
