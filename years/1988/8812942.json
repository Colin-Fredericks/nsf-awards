 "awd_abstract_narration": "Inputs of high-temperature fluids to the oceans along                      seafloor-spreadings centers, including the slow-spreading Mid-                  Atlantic Ridge (MAR), are now recognized as playing an                          important role in controlling the composition of seawater.                      Preliminary work on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge by Dr. Trefry's                      research group and several collaborators suggests that freshly                  precipitated iron oxides from high temperature vents serve as                   quantitatively important scavengers of vanadium, arsenic                        and other elements from seawater.  If this is indeed occuring                   it would influence the global cycling of these elements.                             Dr. Trefry proposes to test several hypothese involving                    the scavenging role of vent-derived iron oxides on the                          chemistry of vanadium, arsenic, molybdenum and other                            oxyanions, as well as cadmium, copper and manganese in                          seawater.  The study will focus on the TAG Hydrothermal Field                   on the MAR and involve collection and analysis of dissolved                     and particulate samples from a known vent plume.  In addition                   to the scavenging study, his research will help address                         questions relating to the spatial density of vent sites on the                  MAR, changes in plume shape and chemistry over time, far-field                  transport of metal-rich particles, and the transport and                        cycling of carbon and sulfur with vent-related precipitates.",
