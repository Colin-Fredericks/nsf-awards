 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to determine how the fine-             scale patterns of herd size, inter-individual distance, herd                    spacing, and herd movement in antelope are affected by the fine-                scale spatial distribution and patchiness of their food supply.                 The project both addresses important current theoretical issues                 in behavioral ecology and provides highly relevant information                  for range management and conservation.  The study will focus                    primarily on Thomson's gazelles and will be carried out in Kenya                for a three-year period.  The basic research questions involve                  the testing and refinement of several current animal settlement                 and optimal group size models.  Computerized graphical techniques               will be used to define the food patch pattern.  The dispersion                  and movement of gazelles over these areas will be mapped at                     intervals using a highly accurate laser rangefinder and a                       computerized navigational system.  Food intake rates will be                    measured and radio-tracking of selected individuals, aerial                     surveys, controlled manipulations of food distributions, and                    comparative observations on other antelope species will be                      conducted.                                                                              The investigators will be working in close collaboration                with several Kenyan biologists: Dr. Jonah Western of Wildlife                   Conservation International, Dr. David Andere of KREMU (Kenya                    Rangeland Environmental Monitoring Unit), and a graduate student                from the University of Nairobi.  KREMU is charged with monitoring               rangeland use by both wild and domestic stock as well as                        agricultural land use.  As Kenya's population continues to grow,                important decisions will have to be made concerning these three                 critical resources.  Most of their current data rely on aerial                  surveys.  They are particularly interested in the ground-level                  techniques developed in this project for monitoring fine-grained                dispersion of animals.  Herd size and movement rates may prove to               be a more sensitive and instantaneous index of habitat quality                  than overall animal densities.  Dr. Western is an expert on the                 large mammal community of Amboseli National Park as well as the                 behavioral ecology of the Maasai tribesmen and their cattle.  He                will be conducting parallel studies of herd size and spacing on                 domestic stock, where herd size, herd movement rate, and inter-                 individual spacing can be experimentally manipulated.  The                      combined results of both studies will have important implications               for the management of domestic and wild herds.",
