 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program is concerned with cluster compounds                           containing both transition metals and main group atoms,                         particularly the so-called Zintl compounds. The synthesis and                   chemistry of such cluster complexes will be developed to                        understand the fundamental bonding patterns in these compounds.                 Of particular interest is the creation of discrete complexes                    which have similarities to the Zintl cluster anions and related                 Zintl phases. Classical main group atom-containing transition                   metal carbonyls will be treated with ligands such as CO, and                    their reduction chemistry will be explored following routes                     which have been successful for some known clusters of this                      type. Efforts will center around the heavy elements, namely Tl,                 Pb and Bi. Plans include exploration of the direct use of                       various types of alloys for discrete cluster synthesis,                         including some of the Zintl phases and main group/transition                    metal alloys. Reactions of bismuth-iron carbonyl and of                         thallium-iron carbonyl cluster anions will be examined as                       sources of high nuclearity substances. Compounds will be                        characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, magnetic                     measurements, electron microscopy and NMR, Moessbauer and IR                    spectroscopies as appropriate.                                                                                                                                  The reactions under investigation in this project have strong                   implications for solid state chemistry and materials science as                 well as catalysis.",
