This is to be done through an intensive study of two                 assays for cell adhesiveness: a parallel plate assay for adhesion               under conditions of flow, and a centrifugal assay.  The former is               an important assay which indicates the factors which control the                type of adhesiveness found in the vasculature, and in many                      biotechnological devices; the latter is a diagnostic assay used by              biological scientists to quantitate adhesiveness, but whose                     interpretation and proper implementation have yet to be                         demonstrated.                                                                                                                                                   The systematic studies proposed here should yield important                     results and test hypotheses about how cells make adhesive                       contacts.  It should provide valuable information for scientists                and engineers whose aims are to manipulate cell behavior in                     disease states, or to design and implement biotechnological                     devices which involve adhesive interactions.",
