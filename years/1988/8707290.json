 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growth of intersegmental pathways will be examined at early                 developmental stages in the chick embryo spinal cord.  Retrograde               and anterograde labeling of growth cones and pathways will be                   carried out using HRP histochemistry and the material examined in               the light and electron microscope.  The localization of several                 molecules that may be involved in axonal guidance and pathway                   formation will be examined by immunocytochemistry.  A variety of                perturbation experiments, including deletion of specific pathways               or pathways cues, heterotopic spinal cord transplants, spinal                   cord rotations, and supression of neuronal activity will be used                to begin to reveal some of the possible mechanisms involved in                  pathway formation.  The long-term goal of these studies is to                   gain a better understanding of the cellular and molecular                       mechanisms that are critically involved in the ontogeny of                      specific axonal pathways in the vertebrate spinal cord.                         Understanding the mechanisms that regulate pathway formation                    during development is directly relevant to the important topics                 of spinal cord regeneration and related forms of neuronal                       plasticity.",
