 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide partial support for a workshop on risk                  analysis in developing countries to be held from July 5-10, 1988                in Nairobi, Kenya. The workshop will bring together many of the                 world's leading researchers in risk analysis to review the status               of comparative research on risk assessment theory and methods.                  Funding by the National Science Foundation will provide partial                 support for three American researchers to attend the workshop.                  NSF funds will also be used to support the writing of a                         background paper that reviews the recent literature on risk in                  developing countries. Professor Jane Ives, the principal                        investigator and workshop organizer, is a prominent scientist in                international aspects of risk assessment. Her qualifications and                broad experience are major assets  for the writing of the                       background paper and for the successful management of the                       workshop.                                                                                                                                                       The workshop will address key issues surrounding the suitability                and applicability of risk analysis methods and approaches for                   developing countries. Three central questions to be addressed by                the workshop are:  To what extent are risk analysis methods and                 approaches culture bound?  To what extent can risk analysis                     methods and approaches be adapted so as to be sensitive to the                  needs of developing countries?  What lessons can be learned from                analogous attempts to transfer assessment and decision making                   methods from developed to developing nations.  As part of the                   workshop, several case studies will be presented and discussed.                 It is expected that the workshop will advance the state of                      knowledge on risk in developing nations.  It is also expected                   that the workshop will (1) identify promising areas for future                  research, and (2) establish linkages among scientists from the                  United States and developing countries.",
