 "awd_abstract_narration": "The history of the climate is recorded in deep sea sediments and                reflection seismology is one of the principal methods of studying               these sediments. Yet we have a poor understanding of the relation               between observed seismic reflection records and variations in                   physical properties of deep sea sediments.  In order to                         investigate the relationship between the observed sequence of                   seismic reflections in the deep ocean and various physical and                  chemical oceanographic events over the last 30 million years the                principal investigators propose to collect high resolution                      seismic data on the Ontong Java Plateau where water depths range  from          2000 meters to 4500 meters and where a series of existing                       and proposed drill holes provide a detailed record of                           oceanographic events over this time period.  This region is one                 of the few regions of the world where seismic lines can be run                  continuously over this depth range without encountering major                   structural or erosional interruption.  This depth range is                      critical because sediments deposited in depths of 4500 meters                   will have experienced considerable dissolution of carbonate, a                  major component of the sediment record; sediments as shallow as                 2000 meters will not have experienced this dissolution.  It is                  thought that the seismic reflection record in the deep Pacific                  Ocean is related to periods of varying degrees of dissolution.                  It is not known what causes the impedence contrasts that produce  the           reflection record in shallower waters away from sources of                      terrigenous sediment.  Seismic lines tying directly from the deep ocean         to intermediate depths will be important in advancing our                       understanding of observed seimic records.",
