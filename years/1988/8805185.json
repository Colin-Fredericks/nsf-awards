The conference is designed to review current and                     planned industrial applications of accelerator developments                     and emphasizes the many connections between basic accelerator                   research and applications.                                                                                                                                      Scope:  The series of conferences on applications of                            accelerator technology has grown in importance.  The exposure                   of foreign scientists is important to their countries and                       helps U.S. scientists and industries in their dealings with                     these countries.",
