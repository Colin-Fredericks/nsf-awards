 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to examine design and implementation           issues in languages intended for programming multiprocessor systems.            The focus of this project is the SR language, which was originally              developed for programming distributed systems.  The research will study         how to modify SR to support programming in shared memory multiprocessor         architectures.  It is planned to extend SR to exploit the shared memory         by allowing variables and operations to be declared globally or in the          specification of a resource.  The former would provide truly global             shared variables and operations; the latter would provide resource              instance-specific shared objects.  Other language features to support           multiprocessor programming will also be investigated.  The                      implementation of the modified language will build on the current SR            implementation; it will provide important feedback on the language              features.  The implementation work will investigate several                     optimizations that might be employed in the mutiprocessor environment;          e.g., expensive process rendezvous might be replaced by less expensive          semaphore or monitor operations.  Interprocedural analysis techniques           will be used to identify optimizable code.  The research will identify          what language mechanisms are most appropriate to support multiprocessor         programming, demonstrate that such mechanisms can be implemented                reasonably efficiently, and provide a usable tool for further                   investigations into concurrent programming.",
