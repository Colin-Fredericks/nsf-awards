 "awd_abstract_narration": "Specifically, the assembly of the cytochrome b-c1 complex in                    the mitochondrial membrane will be investigated in mutant                       strains of yeast lacking cytochrome b, the only mitochondrial                   translation product found in this complex.  Recently, this                      lab reported that the mutants lacking cytochrome b contain                      significantly diminished (50-75%) amounts of the two core                       proteins as well as the iron-sulfur protein and essentially                     none of subunit VII (the Q binding protein).  By contrast,                      cytochrome c1 was both spectrally and immunologically                           detectable in all the mutants studied in amounts equal to                       that in the wild type.  Subsequent studies of the synthesis                     and import of these proteins into mitochondria from one of                      the mutants suggested that cytochrome b is necessary for the                    proper processing and assembly of core protein I, the iron-                     sulfur protein and the Q-binding protein, but not for                           cytochrome c1, into complex III of the inner mitochondrial                      membrane.                                                                                                                                                       The role of cytochrome b in the processing and assembly of the                  iron-sulfur protein (ISP) will be investigated using an in                      vitro transcription/translation system once the gene for the                    ISP has been cloned in a suitable plasmid.  The import of the                   ISP into both wild-type and cytochrome b-deficient                              mitochondria will be compared plus the intramitochondrial                       sites for cleavage of the precursor form of the ISP.                            Subsequently, the presequence of the ISP will be modified to                    establish which amino acids are necessary for binding and                       import of the ISP.  The results obtained will establish a                       role for cytochrome b in the overall assembly of the                            cytochrome b-c1 complex.                                                        %%%                                                                             The long term goal of this project is elucidate the factors                     controlling membrane formation in yeast.  This organism is a                    convenient experimental system because of its ease in                           manipulation in the laboratory and its well studied genetics.                   The membrane being studied is the inner mitochondrial                           membrane.  The mitochondrion is the energy factory for the                      cell.  The biosynthesis of the inner membrane affords us an                     opportunity to understand biological function based on the                      structural information being generated and to understand how                    two genetic systems, one in the mitochondrion and the other                     in nucleus, interact to direct the synthesis of large                           biopolymers.",
