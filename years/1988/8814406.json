The research is to                  be a continuation of on going research entitled \"Alkaloids for                  Turkish Plants\".  The research objectives are to isolate and                    characterize new and unusual natural products, particularly                     alkaloids, from plant sources.  New compounds obtained will be                  screened for pharmacological activity, if obtained in                           sufficiently large quantities.  Additionally, the novel natural                 products isolated may furnish new insights into the biogenetic                  processes occurring in plants.  Turkish plants to be                            investigated are Colchicum szovitskii and several members of the                                 _________ __________                                           Asclepiadaceae family.  The impetus for this research is the                    recent report (N.Y. Times, Nov. 1, 1987, p. 33) that colchicine                 itself has significantly extended the lives of cirrhosis victims                and has even reversed the damage that cirrhosis does to the                     liver, and secondly, there is little current research on new                    Colchicum alkaloids in the U.S.                                                 _________                                                                                                                                                       Scope:  This project is designed to have the Turkish                            _____                                                                           collaborators identify and gather the natural plants in Turkey.                 They then extract, purify, identify and test the chemical                       compounds obtained.  The research data and samples are sent to                  the U.S. principal investigator for further analysis.  The                      Turkish scientists participate with their U.S. counterpart at                   Penn State University in this advanced testing and data                         compilation.  The advancement of the international exchange of                  scientific knowledge and the training and use of developing                     countries scientists fulfills a major objective of the Science                  in Developing Countries Program.",
