 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this study the PI will continue the investigation of                 isotopes of noble gases, such as, Helium, Xenon and Argon in                    oceanic rocks for which he has been continuously funded by NSF                  since 1983.  The study would involve measurement of helium and                  other nobel gas isotopes and comparison of their ratios to                      isotopic ratios of heavy radiogenic elements such as Sr, Nd,                    and Pb in a variety of rocks from Tristan da Cunha and Gough,                   from Islands in the South Central Pacific Ocean and from the                    Mid ocean Ridges.  The investigator also proposes to conduct                    helium diffusion experiments on basaltic glasses and mantle                     minerals by stepwise heating to understand the process of                       Helium migration from the mantle.  The purpose of this study is                 to find the applicability of Helium and other noble gas                         isotopes in understanding the various processes and the                         chemical evolution in the mantle which has shown inhomogeneity                  in space and in time.  The preliminary investigation on the                     Hawaiian rocks by the PI has already resulted in new findings.                  Dr. Kurz is a very capable scientist and has contributed                        substantially to the field of noble gas geochemistry.  The                      results of his previous NSF funded studies are considered to be                 of high quality by the scientific community and this study has                  a very high chance of being successful.",
