 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Plant Biology to               support Dr. Conrad's research and training under the mentorship of Dr.          D. Lansing Taylor.  Dr. Conrad will receive training at the cutting             edge of modern cell biology (including antibody technology, protein and         fluorescent-probe chemistry, microinjection, and state-of-the-art light         microscopy).  During this training period, Dr. Conrad will study the            dynamics of cytoskeletal elements during fibroblast locomotion.  The            long-term goal is to apply these critical modern techniques and                 experimental approaches to study the dynamics of cytoskeletal elements          during bud formation in the moss, Funaria.  The training which Dr.              Conrad will acquire during this fellowship will allow her to localize           and image up to five different cytoskeletal protein types                       simultaneously, and map multiple physiological parameters (such as              proteins, pH, calcium concentration, membrane concentration, and                subcellular organelles) in the same living cell during bud development.            Although the work to be performed under Dr. Taylor's mentorship on           fibrast locomotion is, in itself, very important, the major significance        of this project lies in the long-term goals of Dr. Conrad.  The                 transfer of these cutting-edge technologies in cell biology to the study        of plant cells is long overdue.",
