 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is now a significant body of literature documenting                  misconceptions harbored by science students which are quite                     widespread and which are surprisingly resistant to change during                instruction.  For many students, such misconceptions are critical               barriers which prevent the attainment of conceptual                             understanding.  This project will investigate some promising                    strategies for overcoming misconceptions in high school physics                 courses.  The project will:  (1)  conduct research on students'                 misconceptions and potentially useful physical intuitions; (2)                  develop innovative lessons for dealing with several specific                    misconceptions in mechanics; (3) evaluate their effectiveness in                high school classrooms; (4) conduct tutoring experiments in order               to study student learning processes in detail and to compare                    alternative teaching methods; (5) formulate general principles of               instruction for dealing with misconceptions in physics with                     possible applications to other areas of science and mathematics.                Research that leads to such principles for instruction is seen as               essential for guiding the national development of effective new                 course materials and software for students and teachers.  The                   project will be carried out by a team of high school teachers and               researchers who have worked together to produce innovative                      lessons and research studies.  Thus, the project will be working                directly at the interface between the science education research                community and the classroom.",
