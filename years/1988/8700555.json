 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed research is to investigate the impact of               the environment on the post-embryonic development of the                        circadian system.  He plans to use the cockroach as a model                     system for these studies because of the wealth of background                    information that is available on the anatomical organization and                physiological properties of this animal's circadian system.                     Preliminary data indicates that specific lighting conditions to                 which the cockroach is exposed during development can have major                effects on properties of the adult circadian system.  He plans to               further investigate the effects of changing light cycles to                     determine specifically which properties of the circadian system                 are affected.  Other aspects of the environment, such as                        temperature may affect the development of the circadian system.                 They plan to determine if there is a critical period during                     development when the system is susceptible to various other                     environmental manipulations.  Finally they plan to investigate                  the functioning of the circadian system in the developing animal.               The discovery that the environment of the developing organism can               affect the development of the circadian system is most important.               Because of the pervasive influence of the biorhythm system on                   various aspects of behavior and physiology in most animals, the                 results of these studies will provide basic information on the                  fundamental question of whether or not the properties of the                    circadian system that are established during development are                    susceptible to environmental manipulation.",
