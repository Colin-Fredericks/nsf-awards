 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditionally, manufacture of polymers was done in batch reactors with          little fundamental understanding of the interaction of kinetics and             transport phenomena.  With the growth of demand for polymers and                increased price competition, more efficient polymerization methods are          being developed.  Manufacturers of high volume commodity polymers now           have fewer product lines and have moved to the use of continuous                reactors.  Producers of relatively low volume, high quality (and                value) polymers are finding that their competitive edge comes from a            deeper understanding of the relationship between polymerization                 conditions and product quality.  Through his research efforts, the PI           expects to design and control reactors capable of producing a more              uniform and higher quality polymer.                                                                                                                             One crucial aspect of new, controllable reactor designs is the                  requirement for improved understanding of the dynamics of                       polymerization reactors.  Polymerization is often characterized by              large heat release, high viscosity, and difficult heat removal--all of          which contribute to difficulties in controlling the dynamic behavior            of the reactor.  A second area of particular importance in                      polymerization reaction engineering is the development of continuous            liquid and gas phase processes for                                              polyolefin production (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, and                   copolymers).  A third area with great potential for process                     improvements is in developing new processes for polymers made by                polycondensation.  This class of polymers encompasses many fibers               and engineering plastics.  In this project the PI will pursue                   research on these problems through both experimental and                        quantitative theoretical studies of continuous polymerization                   reactors.  He plans to develop a quantitative understanding of                  the governing chemical and physical phenomena (i.e., through                    detailed mathematical models comfirmed by experimental data) and                to use this new understanding                                                        (i)  To devise improved reactor designs which provide                                better control of polymer properties and also minimize                          difficult dynamics.  By quantitatively determining the                          ranges of operating conditions and system parameters                            for which oscillations and stability problems arise, he                         expects to provide design procedures which satisfy the                          polymer product specifications and have good economics                          but which avoid those parameter combinations leading to                         difficult dynamic behavior.                                               (ii)  To develop new types of on-line sensors for the reactor                         and polymer particles which allow closer quality                                control of the product and to combine these new on-line                         polymer property sensors with feedback strategies to                            provide control schemes which lead to safe dynamic                              operation and close control of product quality.                         (iii)   To devise new reactor designs for existing and emerging                         classes of polymer products.                                                    * * *                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      //",
