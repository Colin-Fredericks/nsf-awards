 "awd_abstract_narration": "MAX91 is an observational program to study solar activity                  in the 1990's with emphasis on coordination of observations from                existing facilities and also from new balloon, rocket and ground-               based instrumentation.  Accordingly, the program requires the                   early appointment of a solar physicist to act as the \"MAX91                     Coordinator.\"  One component of this grant is for a solar                       physicist to assume the role of MAX91 Coordinator.  The grant                   will effect efficient MAX91 operation by establishing reliable                  one-way, and modern two-way, computer-based lines of                            communications to the solar physics community.  The Coordinator                 will also work closely with a solar forecaster (specifically                    associated with MAX91) to optimize scientific output of campaigns               in response to real-time solar conditions.                                           Three studies which encompass varying aspects of solar                     activity on timescales that vary over eleven orders of magnitude                are also planned:                                                                                                                                               Milliseconds - Seconds                                                                                                                                          Three year observational program with a newly developed, high                   speed digital camera system.  This system can observe                           simultaneously at three optical wavelengths with high temporal                  and spatial resolution:                                                              From comparisons with X-ray data, it is expected to resolve                     important time-of-flight effects of accelerated electrons in                    solar flares; this addresses fundamental properties of                          energy release in flares.
