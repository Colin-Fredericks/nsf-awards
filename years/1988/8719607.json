The results will be                    applied to several current problems in understanding the spectra                of active galactic nuclei and novae.  The improvements to the                   photoionization code named \"CLOUDY\" will largely be in the                      following categories:  a) the improvement in the atomic data base               will be continued; b) the treatment of physical processes will                  continue to be enhanced and made more complete; and c) the line                 transfer methods and assumptions will be improved.  These                       continued enhancements to the of validity of the calculations are               important  since \"CLOUDY\"  has been employed by a wide community                of users to study a variety of physical situations; a) the broad                line region of active nuclei, where an alternative model of                     emitting gas will be investigated; b) the extended x-ray emitting               gas in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151, a region which may be an                    example of Compton heated wind; and c) the nebula around the old                nova DQ Hercules, unique because of the very low temperature                    (approximately 500k) and moderate level of ionization.  Such                    confrontation between theory and observation is an important                    ingredient in the continued development of numerical simulations                of ionized gas.",
