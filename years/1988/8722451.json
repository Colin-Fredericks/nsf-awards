 "awd_abstract_narration": "Twenty-five years ago macroeconomics seemed poised for a                        substantial advance in quantitative precision and usefulness.                   The statistical tools of simultaneous equations modeling had                    reached maturity and appeared ready to allow application of then                accepted Keynesian theory with steadily increasing scale and                    precision.  But these expectations of dramatic progress proved                  overoptimistic.  Keynesian theory no longer represents a                        consensus; the elegant tools of simultaneous equations theory are               less used than a few years ago.                                                                                                                                 Progress in quantitative macroeconomic research is currently due                to the research of several different groups with disparate aims                 and methods.  These include work by commercial forecasting                      organizations on sustained, practically useful, large-scale                     contact with data; rational expectations models that provide                    realistically complex interpretative explanations of how observed               patterns in the data could arise from individual and                            institutional behavior; and methods of probability modeling that                provide an increasingly accurate picture of the uncertainty                     associated with model forecasts and policy projections.                         Communication among these groups is limited, and progress is slow               for all of them because of the shrinkage in recent years of                     funding for sustained, scientifically oriented research in                      quantitative macroeconomics.                                                                                                                                    This grant supports the creation of the Institute for Empirical                 Macroeconomics.  The purpose of the Institute would be to                       encourage research in empirical macroeconomics and related fields               that is large scale, sustained over time, and reproducible, with                quantitative measures of uncertainty attached to the results.  A                renewed effort can be expected to make progress, given recent                   developments in macroeconomics and in computational capacity.                   The institute can play a unique and potentially important role in               drawing together the different strands of empirical macroeconomic               research and pushing out more rapidly the frontiers of                          computational research in macroeconomics.",
