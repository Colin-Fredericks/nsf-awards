 "awd_abstract_narration": "An optical laboratory will be assembled that will illustrate many               important concepts in optics, allow testing of the theories developed           in courses, and provide crucial experimental techniques for probing             condensed matter systems.  All Wooster students are required to perform         a year-long research project in their senior year.  An extended                 investigation allows students to integrate material from a variety of           courses and labs and provides an essential example of their profession.         This grant will allow a new technique to be available for student               research - laser light scattering.  By providing a series of optics             experiments in modern physics and junior independent study, the                 students will be able to use static and dynamic light scattering as a           probe of many physical systems currently of interest to the scientific          community.  The acquisition of a 5 W Argon ion laser, a vibration               isolated optics table, laser amplitude stabilizer and several optical           components will allow our undergraduates to investigate fundamental             molecular processes and to do holography in laboratory courses and in           senior independent study projects.                                                                                                                              The College of Wooster will match the NSF grant with an equal amount of         funds.",
