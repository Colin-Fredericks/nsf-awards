 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cut locus of Drosophila melanogaster is a large gene of more                than 200 kb, with a complex pattern of complementation.  Each of                the two complementation groups of viable mutations has a                        different phenotype, and the two groups of mutations affect                     different tissues.  There are also a number of                                  complementation groups of lethal alleles, one of which fails to                 complement all cut locus mutations.  Two of these lethal                        complementation groups have a particularly interesting                          phenotype.  In mutant files, all of the external sensory                        organs, including both the external structures and the                          neurons that innervate them, are transformed into a                             morphologically and antigenically distinct, internal sensory                    organ.  The transformation can be observed in both larvae and                   adults.  Mutations from five of the complementation groups have                 been mapped, and the mutations from each group fall into a                      different part of the gene.  This proposal sets out to                          correlate the complex genetics of the cut locus with its                        activity at a molecular level.  Transcription will be                           analyzed in wild type and mutant flies, and individual                          transcripts will be correlated with complementations groups.                    Specific cDNAs will be sequenced in order to determine                          whether more than one protein is synthesized at cut.                                                                                                            Complex genes in Drosophila have the potential to provide                       insight into regulatory features of genomes not accessible in                   other systems as yet.  This project will provide the                            necessary ground work for approaching questions of regulation of                complex genes, in particular, the cut locus.",
