 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objectives of this research project are the synthesis and           characterization of a new class of biodegradable,                               phosphorous-containing polymers.  The biological, chemical, and                 mechancial properties of these polymers will be evaluated to                    determine their potential for orthopedic implant applications.                                                                                                  The synthesis technique involves the polycondensation of a diol, the            main component of the backbone, and a phosphate compound which                  contains a pendant molecule.  The two are dissolved and blended                 together.  After separation into an organic layer, the polymer is               washed and quenched in a petroleum ether.  The final product is a               clear, white powder.  A wider variety of polymers can be anticipated            by further changing the components and degrees of cross-linking.                                                                                                The polymers will be characterized chemically in several ways.                  Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, gel permeation                         chromatography and differential scanning calorimetry are                        characterization techniques that will be used.                                                                                                                  A comprehensive model will be considered to explain relationships               suggested by the results of testing.  Such factors as the mechanism of          polymer particle release to the physiological environment, the effects          of certain biological agents on the degradation process, the ability            of the polymer to induce significant tissue in growth, and the                  degradation and eventual performance of the implant will be                     investigated.                                                                                                                                                   A wide range of medical orthopedic applications is possible: less               rigid fixation plates, joint stabilty with fixation rods, resurfacing           materials to induce regeneration, and prosthetic ligaments and                  tendons.",
