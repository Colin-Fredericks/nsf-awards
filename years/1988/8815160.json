 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to gain an understanding of the                 local environment and the dynamical evolution of poor clusters of               galaxies and compact groups of galaxies.  The high densities and                low velocity dispersions which characterize these systems make                  then unique dynamically.  This combination is expected to lead to               rapid merging of galaxies creating an environment which ought to                be effective in altering the initial properties of disk galaxies,               especially their neutral hydrogen (HI) gas content.  Poor                       clusters and compact groups provide us with an opportunity to                   study the dynamical evolution of galaxies within systems that are               presumably at different stages of the merging process:  compact                 groups on the verge of the merging, while poor clusters have                    experienced several mergers in the past.  This research can lead                to improving our understanding of small groups which are \"natural               laboratories\" for studying the various physical processes which                 make galaxies evolve so rapidly and can shed light on the                       interaction of galaxies with each other.                                                                                                                        Correlations between the HI content of disk galaxies and the                    local environment in which they are found have demonstrated that                the 21-cm spectral line of hydrogen is a powerful tool for                      studying groups.  The local conditions within Morgan poor                       clusters will be probed directly by measuring the HI content of                 their disk population and comparing it to the average gas                       properties of rich clusters and loose and compact groups of                     galaxies. Extending the data base of HI masses and sensitive                    upper limits to include the unobserved groups in Hickson's sample               of galaxies will give a complete description of the global gas                  properties of dense groups.  Using the detected hydrogen in these               groups, a map of its distribution and kinematics should provide                 clues about the degree of dynamical evolution and the physical                  compactness of these systems.  The local environment, i.e.                      neighborhood, in which compact groups are found will also be                    studied in order to gain some insight into their origin and                     formation.",
