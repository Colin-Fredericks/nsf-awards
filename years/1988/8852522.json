 "awd_abstract_narration": "This department's aquatic microbiology project provides two-year           college students with the opportunity, instruction, and equipment               necessary to conduct quality field work.  One of the great resources of         Southern Illinois (and all of the Midwest) is the abundance of water.           This project targets these resources by focusing student experiences on         the microorganisms of aquatic ecosystems.                                                                                                                            Initial work on this project began during the summer of 1987 with          the addition of two new courses:  Field Biology, and Research in                Biological Science.  This curriculum addition, combined with new                equipment purchases, represents the faculty's determination and                 commitment to link the classroom with the world of living organisms.            To support this project the NSF award has financed the purchase of a            quality microscope with phase contrast, epifluorescence and                     photomicrographic accessories, as well as a small utility boat with             equipment for sampling lake and reservoir sediments.  With these                equipment additions, the aquatic microbiology students are being given          an opportunity to combine the excitement and motivation of field work           with experience in conducting sound scientific inquiry.                                                                                                            Students enrolled in these courses are largely those in the                  college's four-year transfer program who look forward to completing the         baccalaureate in a science-related field.  Through reports by these             students often presented to local high school classes and to community          adult groups, the project also contributes to better public                     understanding of science and to increased pre-college student interest          in science careers.                                                                                                                                                  The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
