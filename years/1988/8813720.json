 "awd_abstract_narration": "Money in a centrally planned economy differs in fundamental                     respects from money in a market economy.  Whereas command of                    purchasing power (money) is virtually synonymous with the power                 to acquire goods and services or other assests in a capitalist                  economy, money matters much less in a socialist economy                         characterized by pervasive shortage and non-market processes of                 allocation and distribution.  Instead of the familiar household                 budget constraint from microeconomic theory of market systems,                  consumer choice under socialism is typically limited by a budget                constraint as well as a host of quantity constraints.                           Furthermore, non-monetary benefits associated with a job or                     political position (e.g. connections or privilege) can constitute               a very significant addition to a household's real income.                                                                                                       Exploration of these differences in the nature of household                     constraints and of sources of non-market income and wealth in                   socialist economies is the central concern of the proposed                      research.  The specific purpose of the project is to derive                     estimates of the ruble value of certain privileges in the USSR.                 The distribution of economic welfare (real income) in the Soviet                Union, as well as in other countries where markets play a                       secondary role in resource allocation and the distribution of                   income, is known to depend heavily upon the distribution of such                non-monetary forms of wealth.  The ultimate purpose of such                     estimates is for adjusting conventional measures of the                         distribution of monetary income to reflect the distribution of                  real income.                                                                                                                                                    The data to be used on the project come from the General Survey                 of the Soviet Interview Project (SIP).  The particular privileges               for which information is available are 1) access to closed shops                or special rations, 2) use of an official car, and 3) access to                 closed medical clinics.  Preliminary analysis by the principal                  investigator has found that an ordered probit model using the SIP               respondent's assessment of own relative material well-being                     together with income and privilege variables generates plausible                estimates for the ruble value of these privileges.  The major                   extension of that work planned in this project will be to                       incorporate measures of human capital and other household wealth                into the specification and estimation of the model.",
