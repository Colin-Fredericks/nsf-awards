 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2.5 million hectare Adirondack Mountains constitute an                 ecosystem of enormous value to ecological research.  The size of                the area, rich diversity of ecological communities, and unusual                 protection from human development provide a region of wilderness                character that allows investigation of natural systems and man's                impact upon these systems. Recognizing this potential, in 1981                  the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry began to                 upgrade an existing field station to provide a state-of-the-art                 base for ecological research.  Major improvements were made in                  support facilities, in computerization of a large historical                    database, and in organization of a comprehensive long term                      ecological monitoring program.  In the past five years, the                     research conducted through the Adirondack Ecological Center has                 grown from 20 to 79 projects, including 17 national and                         international studies.  Currently there are 111 scientists and                  graduate students involved in research (24 of the scientists                    from outside institutions).  This accelerated growth is now                     limited by the lack of adequate modern housing/research support                 facilities.  The Center is developing a modern housing facility                 to expand its capacity from 37 bunk spaces to 97.  The greatest                 need at the present time is a cafeteria-style dining facility,                  complete with kitchen, restrooms and shower facilities.  This                   project will provide partial funding for that facility.",
