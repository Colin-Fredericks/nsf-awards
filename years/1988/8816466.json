 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a continuing effort to develop an International Global                  Atmospheric Chemistry Program, the International Association of                 Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics (IAMAP) Commission on                       Atmospheric Chemistry and Global Pollution (CACGP) has agreed                   to act as an international group of scientists to provide a                     forum for discussion of the goals of an international research                  program and to aid in the overall coordination for the program.                 The CACGP has 31 members who are actively involved in                           atmospheric chemistry research.  CCGP members are from                          Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, DDR, France, FRG, Hungary,                   India, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, USA,                 and USSR.  The CACGP agreed to convene a second international                   workshop in Melbourne, Australia in November, 1988.  The                        objectives of this workshop are:                                                     1.   To review research programs presently being planned                        by national and multi-national groups, with the view of                         identifying scientific questions where cooperative                              international research would be most beneficial;                                2.   To discuss goals of long-term international                                tropospheric chemistry research, with the identification                        of an international coordinating mechanism;                                     3.   To prepare a scientific and organizational plan for                        international research in tropospheric chemistry.",
