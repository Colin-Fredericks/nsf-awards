 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed method for the solution of steady-state and transient              temperature distributions in three-dimensional heterogeneous bodies             uses a Galerkin-based integral solution incorporating                           heat-flux-conserving (HFC) basis functions and Green's function                 solutions.  These basis functions exactly satisfy the boundary                  conditions along the boundary of inclusions; hence, eliminating the             tedious task of numerically matching the heat flux and temperature              jump at the boundary of the inclusion.  A Galerkin solution using the           HFC basis functions is a powerful tool to accommodate parabolic and             elliptic partial differential equations in complex heterogeneous                boundary conditions.  The Green's function solution method is used to           deal with nonhomogeneous boundary conditions and to obtain patched              solutions for complex, three-dimensional bodies.                                                                                                                This solution method has many applications to advanced technologies.            For example, one of the challenges faced by engineers is electronic             cooling where the removal of an immense amount of heat from very small          electronic devices is essential to prevent overheating which can                result in device failure.  These small electronic devices are                   comprised of many layers with many inclusions and can be classified as          heterogeneous bodies.  This solution method can be extended to other            areas of research such as the curing of composite materials used in             the aerospace industry, to evaluate the load carrying capability of             composite materials, and to bio-engineering research.",
