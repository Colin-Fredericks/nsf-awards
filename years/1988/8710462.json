 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to obtain basic information on the                 mechanisms by which the synthesis and secretion of pituitary hormones           are regulated in ectothermal vertebrates The initial focus will be on           hypothalamic factors that control thyrotropin (TSH) and gonadotropin            (FSH and LDH secretion and on peripheral factors that modulate                  pituitary sensitivity to these factors in reptiles and amphibians.  The         young turtle will serve as a model reptilian system and the bullfrog            will serve as an amphibian model, with limited comparisons with other           orders.                                                                                                                                                         A.  TSH Secretion: TSH regulation will focus on the role of the                 hypothalamic tripeptide, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), whose             role in amphibians and rrptiles is poorly understood.  We will also             examine actions of potential stimulators and inhibitors from the brain          and periphery, especially thyroid hormones, that may modulate pituitary         responsiveness to TRH.  Acute and chronic thermal effects on pituitary          responsiveness will be examined in the context of exogeous control.             Attempts will be made to analyze pituitary growth hormone and prolactin         responses concomitantly in all studies, and in vitro thyroidal TSH              sensitivity will be measured in parallel.                                                                                                                       B.  Gonadotropin Secretion: Studies on the regulation of gonadotropin           will have two foci:1) The role of steroids in modulating pituitary              sensitivity to gonadotropin releasing hormone will be studied in                relation to the ontogeny and maintenance of sexual dimorphism in                responsiveness to this hyhpothalamic peptide.  2) Attention will be             directed for the first time to the role of nonsteroidal gonadal                 secretions (based on mammalian inhibin) in differentially modulating            pituitary FSH and LH secretion.                                                                                                                                 These studies should provide a foundation for understanding the                 evolution of hypothalamo-pituitary regulation and its integration with          peripheral endocrine targets in ectothermal tetrapods.",
