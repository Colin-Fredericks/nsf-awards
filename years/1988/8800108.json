 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fluid inclusion evidence exists in a number of economic ore                deposits suggesting a link between the onset of fluid                           immiscibility and initiation of ore deposition.  The effects of                 fluid immiscibility on mineral equilibria and ore deposition can                be assessed by incorporation of a modified Redlich-Kwong activity               model for H2O and CO2 from Bowers and Helgeson (1983) into the                  EQ3/6 chemical equilibria and mass transfer computer code                       (Wolery, 1978, 1979, 1983).  This model will account for loss of                components from the system and the effects of two-phase                         separation on pH and chemical speciation of the fluid, as well as               mineral stabilities and deposition.  In addition, stable isotope                partitioning between liquid and vapor phases and simultaneously                 forming mineral phases will be considered.  Preliminary                         calculations for a fluid intersecting the H2O - CO2 miscibility                 gap by a drop in pressure at 250oC are presented.  The model                    predicts the expected rise in pH upon CO2 loss from the system as               well as deposition of carbonate minerals.  One of the paths                     results in deposition of substantial amounts of metal sulfides at               the onset of fluid immiscibility.                                                    Dr. Bowers will teach a course entitled Thermodynamics of                  Geologic Processes, present a series of graduate lectures on                    various aspects of her work, and bring to Harvard complete                      computer capabilities for geochemical modeling appropriate to the               course and for further student use on their own research                        projects.                                                                            This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1)                 to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                  engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF                  and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and                     engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists                and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic                    institutions.  By encouraging the participation of women in                     science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future                     scientific vitality.",
