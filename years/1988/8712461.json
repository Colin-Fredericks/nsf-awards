 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is an award by the National Science Foundation under            the Materials Processing Joint Initiative.  The objective of the                research is to study the effects of plasma source ion implantation              on the microstructural, mechanical, and tribological properties of              hard materials.  The research emphasizes investigation of plasma                physics scaling laws (for example, variation of plasma density,                 implantation energy, pulse length, and spatial uniformity of dose),             characterization of the micro chemical composition and                          microstructure of the implanted materials (for example, electron                microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray analysis, and Auger electron                spectroscopy), characterization of the mechanical properties (for               example, hardness), and tribological evaluation (for example, wear              resistance, wear damage mechanisms, coefficient of friction).  The              program includes preparation of cutting tools for field testing in              an industrial environment to determine the effectiveness of ion                 implantation in increasing the hardness and wear resistance of the              materials for cutting tool applications.                                             The research program represents an innovative and cost-                    effective approach to improving the wear resistance of materials via            modification of the surface of the material using plasma source ion             implantation.  Ion implantation has been used routinely by the                  semiconductor industry to improve the electronic properties of                  integrated circuits.  The implantation techniques and equipment used            in the electronics industry is too expensive and impractical for                scale-up for use on large area manufacturing of parts such as                   cutting tools.  This program is to investigate the effectiveness of             plasma source ion implantation for treating the surface of parts                having large surface area and complex shapes.  The effectiveness of             modification of the hardness and wear resistance of metals, ceramics            and polymers has been shown for small specimens, and this program               will investigate the fundamental aspects of large area plasma                   sources.",
