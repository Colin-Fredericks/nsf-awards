 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Biological Sciences is improving its curriculum          by introducing an interdisciplinary team-taught course, Instrumental            Methods for Biologists.  This course corrects a perceived deficiency in         the undergraduate training of biologists with regard to the theory and          application of sophisticated instrumentation.                                                                                                                        Through the combined use of its existing facilities and the                additional equipment acquired through this project, (and with valued            assistance from the Department of Chemistry), the Biology faculty is            bringing to its majors fresh insights into the principles of                    electronics, modern data management, analytical techniques, and                 physiological monitoring methods.  While the new course, \"Instrumental          Methods for Biologists\" is targeted for second- or third-year biology           majors, chemistry and physics majors also are invited to enroll in it.                                                                                               Inclusion of this course in the Biology curriculum provides                students with a foundation in the analytical and evaluative techniques          that are focal to their fields of inquiry, thus accelerating their              transition into competent professionals.  This course is facilitating           the development of enthusiastic, instrumentation-literate scientists at         this university.  The grantee institution is matching the NSF award             with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
