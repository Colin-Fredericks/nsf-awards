 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine the dynamics of energy excitation,                    migration and trapping reactions in the Photosystem I core and                  peripheral antenna complexes of algae and higher plants.  The                   spectral and temporal properties of excitation decay will be                    measured using several picosecond-resolved spectroscopic                        techniques.  Biochemical and genetic manipulations of the                       photosystem apparatus will be used to simplify and dissect the                  Photosystem I antennae.                                                                                                                                         The photosynthetic conversion of light energy into biologically                 useful compounds in bacteria, algae and higher plants provides                  the ultimate energy source for much of life on earth.  The                      initial steps of photosynthesis are in the photophysical and                    photochemical domains and are localized in several types of                     pigment-protein complexes that function either as reaction center               or light-harvesting antenna complexes.  The complex antenna                     system efficiently absorbs and transfers light energy to the                    reaction centers.  The reaction centers are the site of the                     photochemical energy transduction.  The reaction center and its                 energetically coupled antenna pigments are the functional                       definition of the photosynthetic unit.",
