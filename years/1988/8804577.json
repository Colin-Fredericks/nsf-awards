 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research                   Equipment for the Mathematical Sciences program of the Division                 of Mathematical Sciences. It is for the purchase of special                     purpose equipment dedicated to the support of research in the                   mathematical sciences.  In general, this equipment is required by               several research projects, and would be difficult to justify for                one project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation                is coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers,                 and with substantial cost-sharing from the institution submitting               the proposal.  This is an instance of university, industrial, and               government cooperation in the support of basic research in the                  mathematical sciences.                                                               The equipment purchased will be used in the Statistics                     Department at the University of Rochester for research in the                   following projects: Methods of four-dimensional biplot                          representation and display; Methods for studying highly clustered               point processes; Goodness-of-fit and order constrained inference                using \"isotones\"; Analysis of survival data; and Detection of                   clustering and trends in disease data.",
