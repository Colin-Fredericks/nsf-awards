 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Minority Research Initiation (MRI) Planning Grant                     proposal.  The proposed research is in the field of mathematics                 and will be concerned with graph transformations.  In this study,               a generalization of the line graph and the r-partial line graph                 will be considered.  These studies have applications to the                     development of efficient computer programs for finding the                      components of a graph and computing the r-partial line graph.                                                                                                   The Planning Grant will first allow the principal investigator to               broaden his scientific horizons by providing funds for travel and               release time so that he may visit other universities and attend as              many conferences as possible.  In addition, the planning process                will include preliminary studies of problem formulations and                    solutions.  These experiences will be incorporated, overall, in                 the development of a competitive proposal for submission to the                 MRI research initiation component.",
