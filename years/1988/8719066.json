 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will examine six-legged animals (insects) as first        step toward testing whether or not design solutions exist that are              general features of legged, terrestrial locomotor systems.  Results will        be compared with our previous research on eight-legged designs (crabs)          and published work on quadrupedal and bipedal mammals.  Using newly             developed, miniature force-plate the applicant proposes to examine              mechanical energy fluctuations and stability. Both aerobic and anaerobic        energy cost will be measured using miniature treadmill.  The applicant          will test whether or not: (1) the use of an inverted pendulum mechanism         during walking is a general feature of legged locomotor systems,                possibility relating to energy conservation; (2) the use of bouncing            mechanisms during high-speed locomotion is a general feature of legged          stress; (3) major variations in body form of legged locomotor systems           affect mechanical power output which may determine metabolic energy             cost; (4) stability is the foremost design criteria in small legged             terrestrial locomotor systems independent of body form.  The comparison         of a 6-legged design with 2-, 4-, and 8-legged animals will provide the         foundation for the future investigation of the impact of variation in           body form on terrestrial locomotion.//",
