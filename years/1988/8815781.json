 "awd_abstract_narration": "Particle simulations are now commonly applied to the analysis of fully          and partially ionized plasmas.  Sophisticated techniques have been              developed to self-consistently simulate fully ionized and solid state           plasmas.  In comparison, the use of Monte Carlo Particle Simulations            (MCS's) for modeling low temperature partially ionized collisional              plasmas is in an immature state of development.  This condition                 results from the difficulty of selfconsistently including the effects           of electron - electron collisions and changes in the charge density             due to sparse ionization collisions in a MCS under highly collisional           conditions.  The parameter space in which these processes are                   important, and for which MCS's are the most practical method of                 analysis, includes many technologically important plasma devices.               Among these devices are plasma processing reactors, plasma switches,            ion sources, and the sheath regions of higher pressure discharges.  In          this work, computational techniques will be developed whereby MCS's             may be self-consistently applied to the analysis of partially ionized           plasma while including changes in the charge density (Poisson's                 equation) and electron transport properties, and including electron -           electron collisions.  Particle - particle, particle - mesh. and hybrid          particle - continuum techniques will be investigated.  The validity             and utility of these techniques will be demonstrated by using them in           a model for magnetron discharge sources of the type now being                   developed for plasma deposition/etching applications.  These discharge          sources have the potential for high processing rates with low                   substrate damage.  The model will be validated by comparing to                  experimental data the principal investigator is obtaining in a related          investigation.",
