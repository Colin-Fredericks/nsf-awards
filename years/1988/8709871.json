 "awd_abstract_narration": "Determination is an event which programs the future developmental           fate of a cell or a group of cells.  It is often a stable state but not         necessarily an irreversible condition.  In general terms, a cell or             group of cells is determined when it exhibits the same developmental            fate whether grown in situ, in isolation, or at a new place in or on the        organism.  Determination has been extensively documented and studied            primarily in animals.  In plant development, determination is often an          obscure component because many plant cells are totipotent and can               express this totipotency as a result of manipulation.  Dr. McDaniel has         identified a situation in plant development, floral development in day-         neutral and photoperiodic tobaccos, in which determination is stable            enough to permit investigation.  The proposed study has three major             goals: 1. Establish when the meristem of the terminal bud in day-neutral        and in short-day tobaccos become determined for floral development, 2.          Establish the developmental fate of cells in the meristem of florally-          determined terminal and axillary buds of day-neutral tobacco, and 3.            Establish in day-neutral tobacco the source(s) of the signal(s) which           induces floral determination.  Whole plant manipulations, histological          analysis, tissue culture, and clonal analysis will be employed.                                                                                                     Understanding determination is critical for any in-depth,                   comprehensive understanding of development in multicellular organisms.          Determination has been extensively studied in animals.  In plants this          problem has received only minimal attention.  Dr. McDaniel is attempting        to address this problem using floral determination in tobacco.",
