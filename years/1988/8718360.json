 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action is to support the acquisition of a laser                       densitometer for the laboratory of Dr. Marilyn Mcginnis.  This                  piece of sophisticated instrumentation will be used in various                  experiments which identify gene products resulting from hormone                 action in brain.  Androgens and other steroid hormones are                      thought to exert their effects via genomic activations and                      synthesis of new proteins.  Although proteins induced by                        androgens have been reported for peripheral tissues, proteins                   induced by androgen action in brain have not been identified.                   Moreover, genomic effects of androgen action appear to be                       differentially localized for copulatory behavior and gonadotropin               regulation.  Thus, local differences in binding of testosterone                 and/or its metabolites, or in protein synthesis could account for               the differential effects of testosterone in the neural regulation               of copulatory behavior and gonadotropin secretion.  The new                     technological addition to this laboratory will address the                      question of neural localization of androgen action and will                     identify a specific population of proteins induced by androgen                  action in neural tissue.",
