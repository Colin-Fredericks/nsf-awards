 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past decade the scientific community has become                     more aware of the complex photochemical reactions which occur                   in the middle atmosphere.  At an altitude of about forty                        kilometers and above molecular oxygen (O2) is dissociated by                    ultraviolet light and the oxygen atoms formed react with O2 to                  create ozone (O3).  These reaction sequences are responsible                    for creation the layer of ozone which shields the earth's                       surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation.  Interest in the                    ozone photochemistry has been spurred by concerns that human                    activities such as high flying aircraft, chlorofluorocarbon                     release to the atmosphere, and atmospheric release of nitrous                   oxide by agriculture might result in the destruction of ozone                   in the middle atmosphere.  Since the early 1970's laboratory                    and field investigations have been carried out in order to                      better define stratospheric chemistry and man's potential of                    perturbing this delicate system.  In the course of these                        studies it has been discovered that ozone in the middle                         atmosphere is apparently enriched in the heavy oxygen isotopic                  (i.e., oxygen atoms which weigh more than the most common                       oxygen atoms.)  This finding of anomalously distributed oxygen                  isotopes in the ozone layer has been the subject of scientific                  questioning and debate since current knowledge about the                        mechanisms and rates of ozone production and destruction does                   not predict the observed isotopic composition of ozone.                               This is a renewal of NSF support under the grant ATM-",
