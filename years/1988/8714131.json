 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is a continuation of ongoing investigation of                the defect structure and electrical properties of the perovskite-               related oxide ceramics.  Materials in the lanthanum-copper oxide                system will be investigated during this grant period.                           Experimental techniques, such as equilibrium electrical                         conductivity at constant oxygen activity and constant chemical                  composition, coulombic titration, electron microscopy (including                selected area diffraction, dark field imaging, and latticing,                   will be used to give quantitative information on defect                         concentrations, conduction mechanisms, and on the defect ordering               that occurs in some of these materials.  A domain model at the                  nanostructure level has been proposed to explain the observed                   behavior of partially-oxidized, acceptor-doped, members of the                  related strontium-iron-titanium oxide system.                                        These materials are remarkably similar to the                              superconducting oxides in both compositional and structural type.               An improved understanding of the nature of the defect structure                 and its relation to electrical properties of these materials will               lead to an improved understanding of the mechanisms of                          superconductivity.",
