 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research                   Equipment for the Mathematical Sciences program of the Division                 of Mathematical Sciences. It is for the purchase of special                     purpose equipment dedicated to the support of research in the                   mathematical sciences.  In general, this equipment is required by               several research projects, and would be difficult to justify for                one project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation                is coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers,                 and with substantial cost-sharing from the institution submitting               the proposal.  This is an instance of university, industrial, and               government cooperation in the support of basic research in the                  mathematical sciences.                                                               The equipment in this project is to be used for the                        following projects: Symbolic Computations for the Variational                   Bicomplex; Local Grid Curving Multilevel Techniques; Efficiency                 and Feasibility Studies of best Approximation Algorithms;                       Numerical Simulation of Rotating Spiral Waves in Excitable Media;               Implementation Issues for the Karmarkar Algorithm; Least-change                 Secant Update Methods for Parameter-dependent Equations; and Fast               Algorithms for Cluster Analysis.",
