 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Phillips will examine the dynamics of myoglobin by a                        newly developed experimental method. Analysis of the diffuse                    X-ray scattering will reveal the range and distribution of                      conformational states of the molecule.  The methods developed                   in this project for analyzing the diffuse X-ray scatter from                    myoglobin crystals will also have broad application to other                    macromolecules.                                                                                                                                                 Protein structure and dynamics are intimately related.  X-ray                   crystallography has been a powerful tool for determining the                    average conformation of macromolecules.  Techniques such as                     NMR and fluorecence spectroscopy have provided detailed                         knowledge of the dynamics of targeted \"parts\" of protein                        molecules, but not a good overall description of the motions                    of the entire protein.  Theoretical calculations can predict                    dynamic behavior of proteins, but as yet are limited to                         simulations in very short periods of time.  Their connection                    to reality is still somewhat tenuous.  This project will help                   bridge the gap between theoretical studies of protein                           dynamics and experimental determinations of the real behavior                   of the protein.",
