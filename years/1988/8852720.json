 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes a capability in computer assisted                 cartography in the Geography program. Computer assisted cartographic            techniques and processes are an integral part of several undergraduate          geography courses, significantly enhancing the level of learning among          both geography majors and other students who look to Geography as a             corollary science to their major discipline. In addition to integration         of the equipment into four technique courses,computer assisted                  cartography is introduced as a discrete learning unit into the entire           array of geography courses, thus serving a wide audience from the               entire University. The goal is to provide students with an opportunity          for hands-on experience with computer assisted cartographic techniques          and to allow them to participate in the expanded geographic analytic            processes associated with these techniques. The award will be matched           by an equal amount from the grantee.",
