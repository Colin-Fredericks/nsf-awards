 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past few years, in great part due to the                          acquisition of data from spacecraft observatories such as the                   NASA Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) and the Japanese Hinotori, a                   global picture of the impulsive phase of solar flares has started               to emerge, in which the radiation signatures in different                       spectral regions are all seen to reflect the same underlying                    physical processes.  The spacecraft data show that the hard X-ray               source evolves temporally and spatially in a manner which is                    consistent with the predicted response of the atmosphere to flare               energy input by collisional degradation of energetic electron                   beams.  Spectral line profiles in soft X-rays reveal plasma                     emission measures and velocities which are broadly consistent                   with the predictions of these electron beam energy transport                    calculations of the group funded here.                                               These and other results are encouraging, because                           observations over a wide range of wavelengths can indeed be used                to address two of the most fundamental questions of solar flare                 physics - the nature and cause of the primary energy release, and               the physics of the energy transport processes.  The interplay                   between theory and observation has progressed well beyond a                     simple comparison of qualitative pictures.  We are now at a stage               where theoretical predictions can be used to refine theoretical                 models and so increase our understanding of the basic physics at                work.  This grant will support a program of work to continue this               profitable line of analysis.  It will address diagnostics of                    flare energy transport processes, notably those resulting from                  the acceleration and degradation of suprathermal electrons, in                  hard X-rays, soft X-rays, and EUV.  In addition, it will                        critically examine the physics of the energy release and                        transport in such a picture of the impulsive phase of flares,                   refining existing models to include effects which have hitherto                 received only scant attention, such as reverse currents, plasma                 collective processes and non-uniform magnetic field geometry.",
