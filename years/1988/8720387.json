 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fundamental data on the oxygen isotopic behavior of                        sedimentary/diagenetic/low-grade metamorphic silicate minerals (quartz,         clays and zeolites) are needed.  The research includes calibration of           mineral-water oxygen isotopic fractionations for quartz and for                 zeolites and calibration of intracrystalline isotopic fractionations in         clays.  It also includes research on techniques for the oxygen isotopic         analysis of zeolites and on the kinetics of isotopic exchange between           zeolites and water.                                                                  The quartz-water oxygen isotope fractionation will be calibrated           at approximately 0, 25, 50 and 75 degrees C by growing quartz crystals          in aqueous solution under carefully controlled conditions.  The                 results, when combined with published fractionation data for 200                degrees C and above, should yield reliable metamorphic temperature              range.  In addition to providing information about quartz, the results          will be useful in our attempts to estimate other mineral-water isotopic         fractionations.                                                                      Studies aimed at measuring and calibrating intra-crystalline               isotopic fractionations in clays will be based both on partial                  fluorination and on thermal dehydroxylation.  This will permit an               estimate of both the temperature of the clay formation and the isotopic         composition of the clay-forming fluid.  The ability to do this would be         especially useful in the isotopic study of sandstones, where cogenetic          mineral pairs are very rarely encountered.                                           The proposed studies of the isotopic behavior of zeolites will             indicate the degree to which the isotopic compositions of various               minerals in this common diagenetic/low-grade-metamorphic group provide          useful information about the conditions of their formation and enhance          applications of oxygen isotope techniques to the understanding of low           temperature processes.",
