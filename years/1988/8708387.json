 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests a planning grant to establish techniques and             collect preliminary data to investigate the role of hypothalamic and            pituitary somatomedins in modulating growth hormone release.  The               techniques to be established in this laboratory include specific                radioimmunoassays, preparation of dispersed adenohypophysial cells and          standardization of a perifusion system for measuring hormone release.           The hypothesis to be tested is that local somatomedins play a role in           the negative feedback regulation of growth hormone on its own secretion.        If the preliminary data support the hypothesis, a detailed investigation        of the mechanism of in situ somatomedin activity will be undertaken, and        a regular grant application will be submitted.                                                                                                                  The rhythmic pattern of secretion of growth hormone significantly               influences this important hormone's effectiveness in peripheral tissues.        The pulsatory pattern of secretion is known to be controlled by a               combination of hypothalamic releasing and inhibiting peptides and by            growth hormone itself which limits its own secretion by a short-loop            negative feedback circuit.  The mechanism of action of the negative             feedback circuit remains to be clarified.  Somatomedins are a family of         low molecular weight peptides secreted in response to growth hormone            which are now generally believed to be involved in mediating the growth         promoting effects of GH.  There is, however, substantial evidence that          GH secretion also may be influenced by somatomedins.  The long range            goal of this research is to elucidate the mechanism of growth hormone's         negative feedback on its own secretion and, in particular, to examine           the possible role of somatomedins in this effect.",
