 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is to study and develop formal models of                     bureaucratic communications.  Application is to the development of              artificially intelligent bureaucratic communication networks that               can reason and advise about bureaucratic rules and procedures,                  monitor and expedite message handling, utilize heuristics to                    circumvent procedural breakdowns, accommodate exception handling,               and facilitate adaptation and evolution of bureaucratic rule                    structures.                                                                         The research focuses on structured communications within                    bureaucracies; that is, communications having a bounded syntax and              vocabulary (e.g., bureaucratic forms, verifications, requests).                 The purpose is to understand the basic nature of these                          communications, and to reduce them to symbolic form, amenable to                machine reasoning.  A logic-based representation of bureaucratic                messages and communication is proposed.                                              The significance of the research is that it will lead to a                 deeper understanding of the role and limitations of bureaucratic                rationalization, and the potential application of artificial                    intelligence technology in bureaucracies.",
