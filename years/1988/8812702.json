 "awd_abstract_narration": "How organizations respond to declining resources and                            opportunities is crucial to understanding the way organizations                 develop over time.  This study examines the interplay between                   organizational structures, organizational decline, and the                      strategic response to that decline.  It focuses on the types of                 constraints within the organization itself that precluded                       certain strategic responses to environmental decline and thus                   contribute to organizational inertia.  Dr. Galaskiewicz                         addresses specifically the actions of nonprofit organizations                   located in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis-St. Paul.  Nonprofit                  organizations have faced severe cutbacks in federal support.                    The goal of this study is to understand why some non-profit                     organization, in the face of these cutbacks, pursued                            retrenchment strategies, while other pursued new funding                        sources, increased prices for current goods and services, or                    else engaged in public relations campaigns.  The hypothesis is                  that the choice of strategy depends upon the organization's                     product line, the power structure within the organization, the                  organization's culture, the availability of slack resources,                    and the specificity of assets.  The study draws on existing                     surveys of 201 nonprofit organizations, representatives of                      which were interviewed in 1981 and 1984.  It involves a new                     round of interviews, in order to create a panel survey of these                 organizations that will permit the analysis of changes over                     time.   A second focus of the study involves the determinants                   of the level of corporate giving.  By interviewing                              representatives of publicly held business corporations                          headquartered in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area the study                  will shed light on why, under environmental conditions of tight                 resources, corporate philanthropy has in fact increased since                   1980.  Corporations in the Twin Cities are a good case in point                 since their levels of corporate philanthropy are among the                      highest in the nation.  The hypothesis is that contributions                    will be greater if an ethic of social responsibility has become                 part of the corporate culture, and that this should be                          independent of a firm's market position, executives' ties to                    local elites, and profitability.  This research examines some                   important and timely problems involving the linkages, in the                    form of philanthropy, that develop between corporations and                     nonprofit groups in urban communities.  But it uses the                         specific instances of philanthropy and nonprofit groups to                      examine broader issues involving organizations more generally.                  Accordingly, it should produce valuable insights on the                         processes of organizational decline and rentrenchment.",
