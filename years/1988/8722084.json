 "awd_abstract_narration": "Overlaying maps showing zones or polygons assigned to categorical         classes is a frequent and basic process in geographical information             systems (GIS).  Decisions or inferences made on the basis of overlaid           maps can be no more sound or valid than the information contained on            component maps and on the maps that are derived by combining and                permuting input maps.  We possess few statistical techniques for                analyzing the error inherent in categorical maps and even fewer                 techniques for alerting those who use GIS maps to the errors inherent           in the images they see.  The progress that has been made in developing          tools for treating continuous distributions has not been matched with           understandings of the discrete categories shown on categorical maps.                 Professor Chrisman's research will strengthen the theory of map            error and generate new statistical procedures to describe error on              overlaid categorical maps.  Chrisman's work will make it possible for           maps to be accompanied by information on probable error.  Users will            then be able to factor such imprecision into the decisions and                  inferences they make on the basis of maps produced by overlay                   procedures.  As part of the process of developing such indices,                 Chrisman will explore the development of a new class of spatial                 statistics with applications beyond categorical maps.  His work will be         an important step toward development of a general and generally-                accepted model of error in cartographic data and in cartographic                display.",
