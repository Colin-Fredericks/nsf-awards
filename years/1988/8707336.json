 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transferrin receptor is the cell surface protein                       responsible for iron transport into mammalian cells.  In this                   study the regulation of the transferrin receptor at the mRNA                    level will be studied.  A myeloid cell line, HL-60, will be used                as a model system.  Transferrin receptor levels are known to be                 sensitive to differentiation, exogenous concentrations of non-                  transferrin iron and iron chelators.  It has been hypothesized                  that receptor levels fluctuate during the cell cycle.  A cDNA                   probe for the receptor will be used to measure the levels of                    mRNA.  The size of the mRNA will be determined by Northern                      analysis.  Transcriptional activity and the stability of mRNA                   will also be analyzed.  These methods will be used to evaluate                  the level at which transferrin receptor mRNA is controlled when                 HL-60 cells are induced to differentiate along a monocytic                      pathway (with 12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate) or along a                 granulocytic pathway (with dimethyl sulfoxide).  The effects of                 externally added iron sources and iron chelators on the                         regulation of transferrin receptor mRNA levels and on the                       intracellular iron pools will also be measured, and the                         relationship between cell cycle phase and transferrin receptor                  mRNA levels and synthesis will be determined.                                        This is a Research Opportunities for Women Career                          Advancement Award.  This award will permit Dr. Enns to extend                   her studies of the control of cellular transferrin uptake to the                level of receptor gene expression by enabling her to gain                       experience in techniques of molecular genetics.",
