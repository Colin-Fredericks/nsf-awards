These surveys collect                     demographic, educational, employment and geographic data on a                   cohort of scientists and engineers who were originally identified               in the 1980 Census of Population. This information allows NSF to                examine levels, changes, and trends, particularly in the                        employment experience, of a large and important segment of the                  science and engineering labor force.                                                    NSF, in its role as principal Federal agency on scientific              and engineering activities, is charged with maintaining an up-to-               date  data base on the scientific and technical personnel in this               country. That data base, the Scientific and Technical Personnel                 Data System, is comprised of data from this survey, the Survey of               Recent Science and Engineering Graduates, and the Survey of                     Doctorate Recipients. Information from these three sources are                  combined to produce national estimates of the numbers and                       characteristics of the Nation's scientific and engineering labor                force.",
