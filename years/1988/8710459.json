 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is to document seasonal succession of                     planktonic forams in a subtropical area influenced by seasonal                  upwelling and to identify those species which are \"upwelling                    indicators\".  Also the investigator would compare the subtropical               upwelling regions to equatorial and subpolar regions influenced                 by similar seasonal upwelling.  The other aim of this research is               to determine upwelling signals in the oxygen isotope record of                  various forams and then to compare such signals to signals in the               sediment record. The area of investigation is northeast of Santa                Catalina Island in San Pedro Basin (Off California).                                    The research will also include integration of faunal and                isotopic data from a variety of sources such as sediment traps,                 plankton tows, core tops etc.  The results will have direct                     applications in marine geology, particularly in paleoceanography                and will contribute to future GOFS projects.                                            The PI is a well known scientist and the chance of a                    successful completion of this project is very high.",
