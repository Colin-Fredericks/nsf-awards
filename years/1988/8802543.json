 "awd_abstract_narration": "This zero dollar contract with Air New Zealand has been                         negotiated to provide Standard Depot Level Maintenance (SDLM) on                the National Science Foundation's LC-130 aircraft.  The aircraft                undergo a yearly overhaul, and the ability to have this                         maintenance performed in Christchurch, New Zealand, will enhance                the capability of VXE-6 to accomplish its mission in the                        Antarctic Program.  Since the majority of the yearly flying is                  done in and around Christchurch and Antarctica, having                          maintenance capability close to the source of heavy flight                      operations will allow more flexibility in the scheduling of                     yearly maintenance.                                                                                                                                             This contract provides aircraft maintenance support to the                      program and will be administered, including distributions of                    funds, by the U.S. Navy - Fleet Air Western Pacific Repair                      Activity in Atsugi Japan.                                                                                                                                       The program manager recommends awarding of this action.",
