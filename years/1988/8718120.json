 "awd_abstract_narration": "The signal for sex determination in the nematode                                Caenorhabditis elegans is the balance between the number of                     X-chromosomes and the ploidy of the animal.  This implies                       that somehow the number of X-chromosomes is counted by                          something on the autosomes.  X-linked genes are also subject                    to dosage compensation so that 1X animals (males) and 2X                        animals (hermaphrodites) make similar levels of X-linked gene                   products.  Three autosomal genes, dpy-21, dpy-26, and dpy-27,                   affect both sex determination and the level of X-linked gene                    expression.  The interactions between these three genes and                     the X-chromosome will be used to screen and select for new                      alleles of these genes and any other genes with similar                         effects.  Both dominant and recessive mutations will be                         sought.  The selections will also be used with mutator                          strains to find new mutations generated by transposons.                         Transposon-induced mutations will be used to clone the genes,                   and the cloned genes will be characterized.  The interactions                   between these genes and the X-chromosome, and the role of                       specific parts of the X-chromosome in sex determination will                    be studied by transforming worms with cloned X-linked                           sequences.  Preliminary results indicate that X-linked clones                   have been found that cause chromosomal males to develop as                      fertile hermaphrodites.  The clones will be analyzed in                         greater detail by finding the smallest piece of the X that                      causes sex reversal.  If such a piece is found, its                             distribution in the worm genome and among other animals will                    be determined and its function studied in transgenic lines.                                                                                                     The long term goal of these experiments is to ask how the X-                    chromosome interacts with the autosomes to determine the sex                    of the animal and to set the level of X-linked gene                             expression.  How sex is determined in animals is a mystery                      and genetically interesting.  The results of these                              experiments should give greater insight into this process in                    a relatively simple animal.",
