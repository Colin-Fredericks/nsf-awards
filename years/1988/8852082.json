 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is enhancing the course content in undergraduate organic            chemistry laboratories by the addition of an NMR to the Organic                 Chemistry laboratory.  Implementation of this project involved the              purchase of a Varian EM 360L 60 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance                  Spectrometer (NMR).  Students are having direct hands-on experience             using this instrument and are acquiring skill in interpreting NMR               spectra.  After completing an experiment designed to introduce the              techniques of NMR, students continue to use NMR in subsequent                   experiments to verify the structures of the products of synthetic               reactions.  Students are also using NMR to analyze product ratios in an         experiment where a mixture of products is obtained.  In addition,               extensive use of NMR is being made during a unit on organic qualitative         analysis.  The addition of NMR to the Organic Chemistry laboratory              course is giving students an understanding of this very important               analytical technique which is now an essential feature of modern                organic chemistry.
