 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is currently some question as to whether the biological                   resources of the Antarctic marine ecosystem are divided into stocks             that can be managed separately or constitute a single community which           is influenced by common events over a large geographic area.  In order          to address this question, comparable data for populations of the same           species collected from different regions over a large time span are             needed.  Researchers have been monitoring reproductive rates of                 Weddell seals at several locations in Antarctica, but none has yet              attempted to compare the various data sets.  Testa proposes to analyze          and compare existing data on the annual reproductive rates of Weddell           seals from McMurdo Station (U.S.) with those from Davis  (Australia)            and Signy Island (British) Stations to determine whether large-scale            factors influence reproductive success in distinct populations from             widely separated geographic locations.  The work will be conducted in           collaboration with members of the British Antarctic Survey and the              Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition.  Data also exists            on food habits of Weddell seals at these locations, and will be                 utilized for interpretation of data sets.  Results will provide a               foundation for better management of Antarctic marine biological                 resources, as well as an opportunity for international collaboration            and dissemination of information.  Results should also further our              understanding of life-history evolution and population ecology of               large mammals.",
