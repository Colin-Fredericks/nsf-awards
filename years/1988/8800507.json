 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research project is an integrated study of final vowel                 lengths in Hausa, a widely spoken language of Nigeria and Niger,                one of the rarer languages of the world with contrastive length                 in word final position.  The findings should throw light on the                 structure of the lexicon, contribute to a deeper understanding of               shortening, lengthening, and neutralization processes in the                    morphosyntactic component of the grammar, and provide                           instrumentally determined descriptions of these differences                     operating at various levels of the language.  The study will                    contribute to current interest in the theoretical status of                     length in phonology by providing a comprehensive case study on                  which to test such notions.                                                          Dr. Newman's interactive activities will include teaching                  courses in her specializations (Hausa language and lexicography),               supervising graduate students in Hausa linguistics, presenting                  guest lectures at various forums, and generally providing a role                model to the female academic community as a scientist working in                a subfield of linguistics where women tend to be underrepre-                    sented.                                                                              This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1)                 to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                  engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF                  and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and                     engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists                and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic                    institutions.  By encouraging the participation of women in                     science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future                     scientific vitality.",
