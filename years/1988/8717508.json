 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a renewal of an investigation into the                  interaction between nitrogen and particle fluxes in the open                    ocean.  The study features a time-series approach at a site  60                 km southeast of Bermuda and the examination of nitrogen isotopic                ratios as an in situ tracer.  Results to date have provided a                   seasonal record for particle flux in the upper 350m and nitrogen                isotope values for both suspended and sinking particles in the                  upper ocean.                                                                            The proposed research focuses on several keu questions: 1)              How does the magnitude of particle fluxes in the upper 500 m of                 the open ocean compare with other measures of new production and                what is their seasonal and interannual variability? 2) What are                 the sources of \"new\" nitrogen to the euphotic zone and their                    seasonal, interannual, and regional variability? 3) How are                     sinking particles derived from suspended particles in the                       euphotic zone? 4) What is the nature of the coupling, if any,                   between suspended particles below the euphotic zone and particles               sinking to this region?//",
