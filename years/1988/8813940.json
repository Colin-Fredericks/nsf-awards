 "awd_abstract_narration": "A previous NSF award (CES-8606118) examined the potential of recent             advances in Very Large Scale Integrated Circuits (VLSI) to provide a            low-cost high-technology device for measuring environmental loads and           effects.  Specifically, the objective was to (1) define the                     requirements for a data acquisition system to measure environmental             loads and effects, and (2) to interact with researchers and producers           of VLSI Circuits in order to design and construct a prototype VLSI              Circuit to implement this data acquisition.                                                                                                                     This action is a specific outcome of that award, and it involves the            GEOS (General Earth Observation System) technology developed by the             U.S. Geological Survey to measure earthquake ground motions, including          the strong ground motions of interest to earthquake engineers.                                                                                                  The Research Triangle Institute (RTI) is working with the U.S.                  Geological Survey (USGS) toward the development of a plan to introduce          modern microelectronics technology into the GEOS data acquisition               system.  The objectives are: (1) to study the hardware and software of          the GEOS system, (2) identify the parts of the GEOS system that can be          implemented with Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) using          VLSI technology, (3) determine the impact of VLSI technology insertion          on the system                                                                   size, power requirements, reliability, and production costs, and                (4) identify the performance enhancements that can be made using                modern microelectronics technology and additional application                   areas that can be served by the enhanced system.",
