 "awd_abstract_narration": "A critical need exists for small, universally applicable, high speed,           high accuracy assembly mechanisms for assembly of microelectronics              and other similar objects.  High speed                                          micropositioners are difficult to design, expensive to build, and               difficult to maintain in satisfactory working order.  The Stewart               platform has potential for application as a six degree of freedom               micropositioner.  It has been successfully applied in low speed,                low accuracy applications.  It provides exceptional mechanical                  stiffness and is easy and cost effective to manufacture.  No                    research has been done in the application of the Stewart platform               as a high speed, high accuracy manufacturing or assembly machine.               This realm of operation develops significant nonlinear inertial                 terms in the mass dynamics, which render control difficult.  This               project examines kinematic synthesis techniques to decouple and                 linearize the mass dynamics.  A state variable model of the                     mechanism is being developed which is based upon the linearized                 equations of motion.  Control is simulated for high speed, high                 accuracy motion.  The simulation reflects commercially available                components.  The influence of extra, redundant legs in                          eliminating backlash and enhancing stability are also studied.                  The Stewart platform also has potential to simultaneously act as                a positioner and actively reject externally applied vibration                   loads.  The feasibility of this is also being developed.",
