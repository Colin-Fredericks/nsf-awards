 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research develops software components for a fully                     automated system for building knowledge bases about language.                   The knowledge bases produced are structured to be compatible                    with computer systems for processing natural language (natural                  language understanding, natural language generation, and                        natural language translation systems, for example).  The                        knowledge-acquisition system does not require extensive human                   intervention or \"knowlege engineering,\" but builds the                          knowledge base from standard text input, such as conventional                   dictionaries (many of which are becoming available in                           machine-readable form.  Initial work will be with the Longman's                 Dictionary of Contemporary English.)                                                 The significance of this research is that natural language                 processing systems, for machine translation, user interfaces,                   and knowledge based systems, must incorporate extensive                         knowledge about words and their meanings in the real world.                     This work is an important exploration of the extent to which                    the necessary knowledge may be found and built from existing                    text sources (e.g.  dictionaries, encyclopedias).  The                          lexical/semantic knowledge bases generated are intended for                     widespread utilization, both for applications and for further                   scientific investigation by the natural language processing                     research community.",
