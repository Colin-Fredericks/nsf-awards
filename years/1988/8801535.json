In this project, attention will be focused on                                   glycerophosphate acyltransferase which synthesizes                              lysophosphatidic acid.  Recent data have shown that                             mitochondria can export lysophosphatidic acid.  It will be                      determined if lysophosphatidic acid exported by mitochondria                    can be converted to phosphatidic acid and complex                               phospholipids by microsomes.  If so, the process offers an                      excellent mechanism of how cells regulate the selective                         positioning of fatty acids found in glycerophospholipids.                       The metabolic fate of mitochondrially made phosphatidic acid                    will be determined to see if it is used by the microsomes or                    mitochondria or both to make complex phospholipids.  Specific                   cytosolic proteins will be studied as to their involvement in                   the export of mitochondrially made lysophosphatidic acid.                       Glycerophosphate acyltransferase will be purified and its                       topography studied by probing the outer and inner surface of                    the outer membrane with proteases and lactoperoxidase                           iodination.%%%                                                                                                                                                  The work is important in cell biology because it will lead to                   an  understanding of the significance of phospholipid                           synthesis by the mitochondrial outer membrane and the                           regulation of asymmetric distribution of fatty acids in cell                    phospholipids.  The outer mitochondrial membrane is very                        difficult to study because it is very difficult to isolate in                   sufficient quantity.  Dr. Haldar has pioneered methods to                       overcome this problem.  This membrane is important to study                     because many proteins must pass through to reach their site                     of action in the cell.*** //",
