 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to produce a dictionary of the Koasati                        language to be a companion to the Principal Investigator's                      grammar of the language, completed in 1985.  Three of the                       original native-speaker assistants in the compilation of the                    grammar will participate in creation of the dictionary.                                                                                                         Koasati is an American Indian language of the Muskogean family,                 presently spoken in southwestern Louisiana and eastern Texas.                   The dictionary will contain five to six thousand entries based                  on present-day collection and also on material collected in the                 late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  There will be a                 Koasati to English section and an English to Koasati section.                   Example sentences will be provided, and a brief sketch will                     preface the dictionary and explain grammatical terms and                        abbreviations.  Verb paradigm and noun declensions will also be                 given.                                                                                                                                                          It is important at this time to collect reliable data on                        Muskogean languages not only because the number of fully                        competent speakers of the languages in this major group of North                                                                                                American Indian languages is falling, but also because of the                                                                                                   recent publication of Joseph Greenberg's Language in the                                                                                                        Americas, in which the relationship of the Muskogean languages to                                                                                               other North American Indian languages is controversial.",
