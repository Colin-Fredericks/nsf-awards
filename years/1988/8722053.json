 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polar bears undergo a period of fasting in the summer and autumn, when          sea-ice melting makes seals functionally unavailable as a food source.          Pregnant polar bears also fast overwinter, which reduces the food-              intake period to only 4 months/year for this group.  While polar bears          do not undergo true hibernation, preliminary data for both polar and            black bears collected by Nelson suggests that polar bears have a                faculative ability to withstand absence of food for long periods and            at any time of the year by conserving body protein.  Nelson now                 proposes to document clearly that protein recycling metabolic pathways          are in operation in free-ranging polar bears, determine under what              conditions of food availability this adaptation to fasting is invoked,          compare the metabolic pathways involved in conserving protein with              those determined for hibernating black bears, and consider the                  ecological framework in which facilitated fasting is adopted by polar           bears, especially with regard to how it affects their life-history              parameters.  Results may offer significant insight into both medical            and ecological questions and will contribute important data for                 undestanding the mechanisms used by mammals for conservation of body            protein under a variety of ecological conditions.  An understanding of          polar bear fasting metabolism may also result in the development of             useful heuristic models of starvation, associated weight changes, body          weight setpoints and the long-term effects of dieting.",
