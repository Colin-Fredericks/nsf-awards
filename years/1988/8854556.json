 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to increase the level of concern about curriculum            reform among engineering educators in the mechanical engineering area           and to provide a disciplinary environment that is much more supportive          of revision and change in the undergraduate mechanical engineering              curriculum than appears to exist at the present.  The efforts include           the following steps: 1) a conference of the Mechanical Engineering              Department Heads to discuss ME curriculum during the Spring of 1989,            2) a program of \"Awards for Exemplary Experiences with Mechanical               Engineering Curriculum Change\", 3) a follow-on step to determine what           the impact of the curriculum innovation has been after a period of one          year to keep attention focused on innovation in undergraduate programs          in Mechanical Engineering.  The grantee and the institutions of the             participants provide funds that are an approximate match for the NSF            award.                                                                                                                                                          A valuable part of the project is the continuing publication of the             papers about the various efforts to improve the curriculum.  During the         two years of the project this is expected to increase interest in and           sensitivity about undergraduate education among those in the Mechanical         Engineering education community.",
