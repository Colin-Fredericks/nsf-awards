 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mechanical engineering students at this institution need               additional exposure to computer-based engineering system and to the             various stages of design, analysis, drafting, and manufacturing.  This          project provides an integrated computer-aided design/computer-aided             manufacturing software package, precision graphics workstations, and a          numerically-controlled vertical milling machine.  This instrumentation          is used as part of the required design-oriented mechanical engineering          courses and associated electives.  The students learn how to                    realistically simulate product performance in the initial design stage          before committing to detailed drawings and manufacturing.  This project         creates a real-life computer-oriented design environment for the                mechanical engineering students and make available a basic educational          tool for general use in other disciplines.                                                                                                                         This award is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.",
