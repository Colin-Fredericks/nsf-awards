 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop a broad                       conceptual framework for the automated solution of tolerancing                  problems in computer-aided design.  The mathematical basis for                  this framework will be a tolerance representation in which                      tolerances are expressed as constraints on a normed vector                      space of model variations.  The results of this research will                   show that this vector space formulation provides a basis for the                development of tractable mathematical models of the tolerance                   analysis and synthesis problems.  An efficient computational                    framework will be developed for the automated solution of these                 mathematical models, based on solid modeling technology.                             This work is innovative because no prior research has                      developed a conceptual framework for the automated solution of                  tolerancing problems.  Since the establishment of such a                        framework has implications for industrial competitiveness across                a broad spectrum of manufacturing enterprises, it is important                  that this work proceed as soon as possible.",
