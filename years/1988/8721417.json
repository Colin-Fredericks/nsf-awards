 "awd_abstract_narration": "The island of Luzon is bounded by a simple system of opposed                    subduction zones. Contrasting slabs of \"oceanic\" Phillipine Sea                 and \"marginal\" South China Basin lithosphere are injected into                  the mantle, where they appear to impact distinctive imprints on                 magma sources.  This project will attempt to model subduction-                  induced source evolution through geochemical/isotopic study of                  post-Miocene lavas from calc-alkalic Bicol and Bataan volcanic                  lineaments, and the alkalic Taal-Banahaw group in southern Luzon.               Data for major and trace elements, and Be-10, Sr, Nd, Pb, H, and                O isotopes will be used to contrast effects of subducting                       (sparse) pelagic sediment and MORB basement  with (voluminous)                  continental sediment and variable MORB \"transitional\" basement.                 Thus it should be possible to asses the influence of subducted                  sial on the genesis of alkalic magma. Several specific questions                will be addressed including: 1.  The long term history of the                   suprasubduction mantle: was this of the MORB, OIB, or sub-                      continental type? 2.  The nature of mantle metasomatism beneath                 the Bataan and Bicol arcs. 3.  The significance of accessory                    phase stabilities; do they compositionally buffer second-stage                  metasomatic melts? 4.  The role of subduction-derived H2O. The                  project will involve sampling twelve active or dormant volcanoes,               and is coordinated with research by the Philippine Institute of                 Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS), and research groups in                   West Germany and France.",
