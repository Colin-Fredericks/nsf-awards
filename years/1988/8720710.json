 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research explores the links between childcare arrangements                 and work outcomes among dual earner couples.  The goal is to                    examine the effects of responsibility for child care arrangements               on the productivity, work commitment, labor supply, and  earnings               of both men and women in dual-earner households.  The study will                utilize data from a longitudinal study of 1972 high school                      seniors, last interviewed in 1986.  The study draws on economic                 theory regarding the houshold division of labor and structural                  constraints at home and at work to test specific hypotheses                     within a more sociological framework.  Central hypotheses concern               the role of intervening mechanisms by which responsibility for                  child care arrangements affects work outcomes.  For example, its                negative effects should be greater in jobs that have greater                    opportunities for advancement.  Previous studies of childcare                   responsibilities have focused exclusively on women; this study                  broadens the scope to look at both men and women in dual-earner                 families.  The project will make a real contribution to the                     literature linking family responsibilities to work outcomes.",
