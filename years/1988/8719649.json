 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Prof. Jacob              Leventhal of the University of Missouri at St. Louis and Dr. Maria              Allegrini of the Istituto di Fisica Atomica e Molecolare (CNR) in               Pisa together with Prof. Ennio Arimondo of the University of Pisa,              Italy.  The researchers' previous collaborative work has focused on             experimental studies of the properties of Rydberg atoms.  The next              phase is directed towards the study of photoionization of Rydberg               atoms, first by blackbody radiation and later, after reducing the               ambient temperature to approximately 15 K, by far infrared radiation            from an alcohol laser.                                                                                                                                          The importance of highly excited (Rydberg) atoms in a variety of                physical phenomena has been recognized since 1934.  Recent interest             in applications such as isotope separation, thermonuclear fusion and            astrophysical plasmas, coupled with the availability of tunable                 lasers to produce state selected Rydberg atoms has led to much                  activity in this area.  The proposed work of the researchers,                   building on previous successful collaboration, is designed to take              advantage of experimental techniques developed both at the University           of Missouri-St. Louis and in Pisa.  The group at St. Louis has                  considerable experience with visible lasers and the production of               highly excited atoms, whereas the group in Pisa has extensive                   experience with the long wavelength lasers necessary to study                   photoionization of Rydberg atoms.  Consequently, their complementary            expertise should prove mutually beneficial and help to advance our              knowledge in this area.",
