 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a laboratory study involving experiments to understand                  changes in modes of speech perception and language understanding                as a function of aging.  The experiments compare the performance                of adults across the lifespan in speech perception faced with                   multiple sources of information.  Young adults are compared with                middle-aged adults and elderly persons in their identification of               samples of speech composed of single or multiple sources of                     information.  Their performance will be used to test how aging                  influences the relative value of each source of information about               speech and the processing of each type of information.  There are               three lines of inquiry.  The first involves the contribution of                 visible speech to speech perception.  As acuity of hearing                      diminishes, individuals may compensate by paying close attention                to configuration and movement of the lips.  The second assesses                 the evaluation and integration of a variety of bottom-up sources                of information in speech perception (audible and visible                        characteristics of speech).  The third focuses on top-down                      sources such as phonological, lexical, semantic, and semantic                   constraints.  Older adults have less information about some                     sources, but not about others.  The experiments will determine to               what extent elderly individuals have less information in                        communication and to what extent they process the information                   they have more or less efficiently than young adults.  These                    measurements of how speech perception and language communication                change with aging are necessary before it can be determined how                 any deficits might be compensated for in day-to-day                             communication.",
