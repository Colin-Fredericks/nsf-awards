 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years economists have devoted considerable attention to               the normative properties of alternative compensation arrangements.              Among the arrangements discussed have been deferred payment schemes,            efficiency wages, piece rates, and tournaments.  The optimality                 properties of the various arrangements derives from the postulated              incentive effects that each arrangement is thought to have.  Yet,               surprisingly there has been very little effort made to empirically test         whether hypothesized incentive effects of compensation arrangements             actually exist.                                                                                                                                                 The proposal consists of two broadly related, but independent projects          that begin to remedy this deficiency.  The first will involve an                empirical test of tournament theory using data available from golf              tournaments.  Data for this project will be assembled from published            sources.  The second project will focus on the impact of sick leave             policies on teacher absenteeism.  This project will examine whether             variations in sick leave policies across school districts affect                teacher absentee rates, and whether this in turn influences academic            performance of students.  Much of the data will be independently                collected in a survey of 700 school districts in New York.",
