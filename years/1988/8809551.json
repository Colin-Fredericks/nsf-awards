 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project are to model, simulate and                       experimentally verify the proposed starting and position orientation            algorithms for permanent magnet synchronous motor variable speed drive          without a position sensor.  Doing away with the position sensor makes           the motor packaging compact, less expensive and mechanically rugged             and robust thus increasing its reliability of operation under all               circumstances.  These advantages are critical in applications such as           robotic drives, aerospace actuators, machine tool spindle drives and            electric drives used in many defense applications.  Position sensor-            less permanent magnet synchronous motor drives are ideal for use in             appliance, automotive and hand-tool industries because of their low             cost.  It is anticipated that the results of this research would free           the control of permanent magnet synchronous motor variable speed                drives from position information obtained from the position sensors             thus making the system open to large scale use in high performance              applications as well as cost sensitive low performance applications             described above.",
