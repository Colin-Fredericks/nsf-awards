 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spiders are uniquely characterized by their ability to                  produce silk nets that trap prey.  The architectures of these                   traps are highly variable as are the physical properties of the                 silks from which they are spun.  In this research the importance                of web design and the reflective properties of web silks to the                 ability of insects to see and avoid them will be investigated.                          Factors that affect web visibility are related to the                   optical properties of web silks and the optical properties of                   websites.  Although nothing is known about how insects perceive                 spider webs, in general insects make use of three different                     visual cues to evaluate their environment:  contrast between                    objects and object background, object color and object movement.                Craig will study how contrast between webs and web backgrounds                  and web color affect the ability of insects to see and avoid                    spider webs.  By taking a comparative and phylogenetic approach,                the field and laboratory studies will explore many of the aspects               of spider foraging modes that affect their ability to capture                   prey.                                                                                   The finding that result from this research will contribute              to our understanding of the evolution of predator-prey                          interactions, in general, as well as the effect of insect visual                perception on the foraging modes of insect predators.  First,                   this work will result in an analysis of how different components                of a prey capture process constrain variations in foraging modes                and hence the evolution of a predator foraging strategy.  Second,               by using a combination of field and laboratory approaches, these                studies will help to identify the factors affecting insect visual               discrimination in the field.  Third, this research will                         contribute to an understanding of the ecological relationships                  between spiders and insects.",
