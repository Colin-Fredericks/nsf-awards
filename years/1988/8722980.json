 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal for two field programs to study the                  tectonics of two regions of the mid-ocean ridge system.  The                    principal tool is SeaMARC II, and these data will be complemented               by gravity and magnetics data.  The first region of study is the                Mid-Atlantic Ridge from 24 to 29 degrees North latitude.                        Continuous coverage of the axial discontinuities and the                        morphotectonic variations along the rift valley over a distance                 of at least 100 km will be obtained. The main objective is to                   understand the variations in volcanic and tectonic activity along               a slow spreading center, the nature of small axial                              discontinuities that offset the MAR, and the mantle processes                   that lead to segmentation of the MAR.  The second project focuses               on the Australian-Antarctic Discordance (AAD).  This is a unique                and poorly understood region of the mid-ocean ridge system,                     characterized by rugged topography and a wide range of axial                    morphologies.  The geophysical data will be complemented by a                   dredging program.  The objectives are (1) to map the region and                 determine the tectonic structure and the temporal evolution of                  the region, (2) to determine the nature of geochemical                          discontinuities in the region, and the nature of the marked                     boundaries of the AAD, and (3) to determine the                                 interrelationships among geochemistry, tectonic structure,                      gravity, and magnetics within and outside of the AAD in an effort               to understand its nature, origin and evolution. These projects                  use an important, relatively new tool for exploring the structure               of the sea floor along mid-ocean ridges.  The data obtained from                these studies should provide important information about the mid-               ocean ridge system and its tectonic and volcanic evolution.",
