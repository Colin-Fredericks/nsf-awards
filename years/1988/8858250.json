 "awd_abstract_narration": "Relativistic quantum field theories which describe the                     nucleus as a system of nucleons interacting through various                     meson fields are being studied by Robert Perry in an effort to                  identify critical elements of the theory which can be used to                   test their relevance. This requires isolating nuclear phenomena                 that can be accurately predicted in a strongly-interacting                      field theory, and that are most naturally understood as quantum                 corrections which are unique to field theories.  Professor                      Perry has focussed his attention on the polarization of the                     nuclear vacuum, which is neglected in traditional calculations,                 and has developed new analytic tools to study experimental                      signatures of such vacuum polarization effects.  He is also                     working on simple models in which the behavior of macroscopic                   degrees of freedom can be consistently derived from the                         dynamics of their quark constituents.                                                This research on nuclear quantum field theories is at an                   interface between particle and nuclear physics and seeks to                     achieve a deeper understanding of a many-body system which is                   unique in physics, the atomic nucleus.",
