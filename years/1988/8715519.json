 "awd_abstract_narration": "Calcium plays a crucial role in coupling excitation to many                     functions of neurons.  One important example is the activation of               ion channel gating.  A recently discovered class of                             Ca++.activated channels is the non.specific cation (CAN) channel.               Dr. Partridge intends to establish that these channels, found in                a wide diversity of tissues, constitute a unique channel class.                 Dr. Partridge has shown previously that CAN channels exist in                   burster neurons.  Although the characteristics of CAN channels                  can be surmised from piecemeal data from numerous tissues, a                    solid understanding of their role in cell function and a detailed               study of channel characteristics in a single preparation are                    lacking.  The proposed research will utilize cell.attached and                  excised membrane patches from burster neurons to measure CAN                    channel selectivity, kinetics, and links to cell metabolism.  The               project will accomplish two important goals.  (1) The                           physiological role of CAN currents has been established in                      burster neurons,  thus a detailed description of CAN channels                   will provide an important link between the cellular phenomenon of               bursting and the action of a specific class of membrane channels;               and  (2) Focusing descriptive information about CAN channels on                 one preparation will provide strong evidence to support the                     hypothesis that CAN channels represent a unique class of                        membrane.",
