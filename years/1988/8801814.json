 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of the metameric body plan of the insect                   Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as the principal model system               for studying the genetic and molecular basis of embryonic pattern               formation. The objectives of this proposal are to make a                        comprehensive study of the interactions between early-acting                    genes of the zygote that control subsequent gene expression and                 determine the fates of groups of cells.  By using molecular                     probes (cloned DNA and antibodies) to study gene expression in                  wild-type and a great variety of mutant embryos, the genetic                    system that controls the time, place and level of pattern-                      regulating gene expression will be systematically dissected.                    Individual regulatory phenomena revealed by these previous                      studies may eventually be studied at the biochemical level in                   order to determine the mechanisms of gene regulation and                        function.  The conceptual framework of development being revealed               by studies in Drosophila relates to the fundamental aspects of                  any complex organism.  The control of cell proliferation,                       gastrulation, germ layer differentiation, position-specific gene                expression, and the number and differentiation of body parts and                appendages are central themes to all complex animals.  By                       exploiting the genetic approach available in Drosophila and                     combining it with advanced molecular and embryological                          techniques, it is likely that more will be known about the                      growth, development, and differentiation of the fruit fly than                  any other animal species.                                                       %%%                                                                                 The development of a complex animal from a simple fertilized                egg is one of the most important problems in biology that remains               to be solved.  In Dr. Carroll's laboratory, he is studying the                  genes that control this process in the fruit fly, one of the best               understood genetic model system for developmental studies.  By                  studying these genes, and the protein molecules that they encode,               he aims to understand how cells are organized into distinct                     groups to form the different tissues, organs, and regions of the                animal's body.",
