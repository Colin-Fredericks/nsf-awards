 "awd_abstract_narration": "Population ecology is a recent approach to understanding how                    organizations are born, grow, and die.  Population ecologists                   use the term \"niche\" to refer to combinations of resources that                 allow specific organizational forms to prosper.  As resources                   ebb and flow, new forms are created while old forms die.  The                   present research will focus on the exchange relations through                   which organizations obtain resources.  The researchers will                     model the dynamics of niche structures by analyzing how the                     organizational networks that define the exchange structure of                   an organizational community change over time.  The                              organizational community to be studied consists of U.S.                         commercial biotechnology firms.  This is a fruitful arena for                   studying organizational niches since the industry's rapid                       development has spawned numerous new resources for organizing                   as well as a variety of new organizational forms.  Longitudinal                 data will be collected on the structure and performance of                      organizations engaged in commercial biotechnology as well as on                 the relationships among the organizations.  The data will be                    analyzed to specify how patterns of interorganizational ties                    have influenced the structure and life chances of biotechnology                 firms.  The results will lead to a theoretical sharpening of                    the \"niche\" idea, as well as enhance or understanding of                        organizational dynamics.",
