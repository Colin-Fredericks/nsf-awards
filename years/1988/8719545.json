 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Warren S. Warren is supported by a grant from The                        Physical Chemistry Program to develop new laser pulse shaping                   and pulse sequencing techniques for spectroscopic studies of                    molecular species in both gas and condensed phases.                                                                                                                The novel aspect of this work comes from the use of enhanced                 control over the laser radiation field to produce simple and                    interpretable molecular states in a wide variety of                             applications.  Warren has demonstrated both theoretically and                   experimentally that it is possible to produce shaped pulses and                 pulse sequences with picosecond resolution, high powers, and                    complete phase control.  He has also demonstrated which                         characteristic shapes would be required to solve specific                       molecular problems such as selective excitation of vibrational                  states, compensation for optical density and relaxation effects                 in both gases and molecular crystals, and velocity selection                    without the use of molecular beams.                                                                                                                                These techniques are being used in a variety of studies.                     For example, two shaped pulses of different colors are being                    used to selectively and completely pump high vibrational states                 in iodine, thus permitting study of both velocity changing                      collisions and the evolution of the reaction which powers the                   oxygen-iodine laser.  Shaped deep-UV pulses plus visible pulses                 are being used to characterize the bending potential and                        photochemistry of HCP.  Localized molecular excitations of                      1,4-dibromonaphthalene are being pumped in order to study                       soliton propagation in fibers.  Finally, photon echo sequences                  are being studied to give undistorted decays independent of                     optical density effects and molecular interactions in mixed                     organic crystals.",
