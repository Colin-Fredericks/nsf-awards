 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research on small                               mammal desert ecology to be conducted by Dr. Michael                            Mares of the University of Oklahoma and two Argentine                           scientists, Ing. Virgilio Roig at the University of                             Cuyo and Dr. Ricardo Ojeda of the Institute of Arid                             Zone Studies, both in Mendoza.  This research project                           will examine habitat selection, population ecology and                          the physiology of small mammals in the arid zone of                             west-central Argentina.  The data collected will help                           identify the patterns of adaptation and colonization                            by two disparate assemblages of rodents.  The validity                          of a density-dependent habitat selection hypothesis                             will be tested.  The results will help provide an                               understanding of how small mammals of the southern                              desert function within the larger desert ecosystem and                          will offer insights into the development of an                                  important desert region of South America.                                                                                                                       Ing. Roig will investigate the physiological                                    adaptations of small mammals to deserts while Dr.                               Ojeda will monitor over the long term the population                            biology, reproduction and habitat selection in a study                          area.  Dr. Mares will examine patterns of habitat                               selection in various habitats with emphasis on the                              dependence of habitat choice on population density.                             Thus the scope of the research is broader than if done                          by one scientist alone.  Roig and Ojeda are the                                 permanent on-site investigators and Mares will add                              extensive experience in ecological, physiological and                           systematic research.  Also, training of both North and                          South American technicians and students will be an                              additional mutual benefit to both countries of this                             research.",
