 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hydrogen is a Key intermediate in the anaerobic diagenesis              of organic carbon.  Hydrogen partial pressures are important in                 controlling fermentation pathways, and theoretical arguments                    suggest hydrogen production rates are high.  In addition,                       competition for hydrogen can be instrumental in determining the                 relative importance of sulfate reduction and methanogenesis (and                possibly iron reduction) in sediments.  H2 is also an important                 precursor for methane in methanogenic sediments (both freshwater                and marine).  However, relatively few data are available which                  permit detailed discussion of the relationship between hy\u001arogen                 geochemistry and carbon diagenesis in natural environments.                     Scranton has studied the distribution and cycling of hydrogen and               acetate in anaerobic sediments for several years and has found                  that hydrogen turnover in these systems is very rapid.                          Production and consumption rates appear to be virtually identical               (no net release or uptake of hydrogen)  and appear to be closely                coupled spatially (occurring in \"clusters\") in the sediments.                   Measured rates of \"apparent\"  hydrogen production, however, are                 much lower than would have been predicted from acetate production               rates measured simultaneously, suggesting that artifacts may                    remain in the measurements of production rates.  Scranton                       proposes to estimate in situ hydrogen production rates using a                  new approach with very thin layers of sediment, to determine the                relationship between a number of fatty acids and hydrogen                       concentrations in the sediments, and to extend our data set to                  include the relatively simpler methanogenic systems.",
