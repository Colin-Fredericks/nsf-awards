 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over 200 instrumented buildings in the Los Angeles area were shook by           the Whittier 1987 (Magnitude 6.1) earthquake.  The data recorded in             these buildings contains a wealth of information and many valuable              lessons for design engineers and code writers.  Six steel frame                 buildings from five to twenty stories in height will be investigated            under this project.  Using very detailed analytical models and systems          identification techniques the effects of the nonstructural elements             and cladding on the response of those buildings will be ascertained.            The nonlinear behavior, effective periods, effective damping, torsion           and the effectiveness of current modeling practices are among those             items that will be considered.                                                                                                                                  This study would provide a careful evaluation of the current ability            to model the response of steel buildings including the effects of real          and accidental torsion and irregularities.",
