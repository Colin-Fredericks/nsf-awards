 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goals of the project are to offer a comprehensive mathematics          inservice program to 125 teachers in southwestern New England over a            period of two years plus followup activities. The participants are to           learn how to serve as resource teachers in their respective school              districts. The program builds on a previously funded project whose              primary focus was directed to elementary school teachers. This project          expands the previous efforts to offer experiences to elementary and             secondary teachers. Also, the model developed in the previous project is        to be expanded here, both in subject matter background and in                   pedagogical considerations, especially with emphasis of the                     constructivist approaches to mathematics instruction. There are four            components to the present project: a two week summer institute to               provide concentrated and intense activities; followup during the                academic year by project staff to help the participants implement the           pedagogical structures; academic courses offered during the school year;        and finally, a supervised internship as resource teachers. The project          was designed with local support and guidance as an outgrowth of the             previously funded project and in response to needs expressed by teachers        and administrators who participated in the earlier project. The                 participants are selected from among those recommended by the school            districts that have committed to the project. The cost sharing is               $182,101 which amounts to 182,101/445,030, or 41% of the funds requested        from National Science Foundation.                                                                                                                               The staff and consultants have excellent qualifications to conduct this         project.",
