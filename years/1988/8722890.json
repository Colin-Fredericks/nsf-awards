 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable collaborative research between Dr. Elizabeth             G. Williams of the University of Kentucky and  Dr. Warren M.                    Williams and John Vanden Bosch of the Grasslands Division,                      Department of Scientific and Industrial Research located at                     Palmerston North, New Zealand.  These researchers will produce                  interspecific genetic hybrids between white clover and kura clover              in order to construct breeding populations of advanced generation               hybrids and backcrosses to both parents.  White clover, Trifolium               repens, is a major pasture legume in both the U.S. and New                      Zealand.  While this clover has the ability to withstand heavy                  grazing if moisture is adequate, thus improving the quality of                  grasslands both with respect to digestible energy and protein, and              in terms of symbiotic nitrogen fixation, unfortunately its use is               limited by a lack of persistence under lowered moisture                         conditions.  Kura (Caucasian) clover, Trifolium ambiguum,                       possessess a vigorous underground perennial root and rhizome system             and is both more drought resistant and shows resistance to a number             of different viruses which affect white clover.                                                                                                                 The University of Kentucky staff will focus their activity on the               generation of new hybrids through a seed embryo rescue technique                which they have developed along with chromosome doubling and tissue             culturing of hybrid materials.  Virus testing studies will also be              conducted in the U.S.  The New Zealand investigators will focus                 their work on X-irradiation to enhance genetic exchange, the                    development of further advanced generation hybrids, and the                     selection for fertility and agronomic performance of the new hybrid             materials.  The collaboration between the U.S. and New Zealand                  investigators, working in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres,                enables a doubling in the growing of experimental hybrid clover                 crops each year.",
