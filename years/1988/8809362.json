 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most dramatic changes in developing countries during                 the last twenty years has been the steady growth of food grain                  production.  Some have celebrated this \"green revolution\" as                    the best hope for development in the Third World.  Others have                  criticized it as aggravating inequalities and neglecting needed                 industrialization.  This study examines the consequences of                     this agricultural growth on several dimensions of social                        stratification:  landlessness, women's labor force                              participation, changes for minorities, literacy, urbanization,                  and growth of the service sector.  The proposed research                        involves the study of changes across 300 districts within                       India, using panel data collected at three points in time --                    1961, 1971, and 1981.  India provides an especially favorable                   research environment because agricultural growth has varied                     greatly across regions withing India, and because India's                       sophisticated statistical system has produced some of the best                  data available anywhere.",
