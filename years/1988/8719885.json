 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program                  suppports research jointly directed by Professors S. P. McManus                 and J. M. Harris, at the University of Alabama at Huntsville.                   This experimental work is directed at evaluating theories of                    solvent effects on ionic reactions of organic chemicals in                      solution.  Since the large majority of chemical reactions used                  in the laboratory and in the chemical industry are carried out                  in the solution phase, this work is important for maximizing                    yields of chemical processes and for optimizing reaction                        conditions.                                                                                                                                                     Specifically, the solvatochromic theory of Kamlet, Taft, and                    coworkers and the empirical approach to reactivity developed by                 Swain and others will be tested and compared by studying                        reactions with known solvation requirements.  Application of                    rate data to the equations proposed by Kamlet-Taft and by Swain                 will be used to assess the success of these methods to treat                    rate data for a variety of reaction types.  This will be the                    first independent experimental program aimed at evaluation of                   these two solvation theories.",
