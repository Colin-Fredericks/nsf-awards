 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project introduces computer science students to a laboratory            environment where they can master the concepts of data communications.                                                                                             The equipment in this data communications lab includes four (4)              microcomputers that are configured for several network connections: a           modem connection and telephone system simulator that offer typical              \"dial-up\" connections between units; a terminal connection that allows          simulation of a computer terminal - host interface; an Ethernet                 configuration that provides high speed networking using coaxial cable.                                                                                             These equipment configurations, along with some special monitoring           equipment and software, allow students to gain hands-on experience in           data communications. The experiments that students can perform in such          an environment can only be carried on in a dedicated laboratory of the          type developed for this project.
