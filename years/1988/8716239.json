These enzymes play                    paramount roles in the detoxification of plant xenobiotics,                     in the biosynthesis of plant hormones, and in the production                    of key intermediates in the synthesis of lignins, terpenes,                     flavonoids and phenolic acids.  The de novo synthesis of some                   cytochrome P-450 monoxygenases appear to be regulated by                        light and by the administration of a variety of synthetic                       auxins and herbicides.  Control over the P-450 mediated                         metabolism of these compounds could lead to physiologically                     relevant herbicide resistance and plant hormone regulation                      events.  Many general features of the regulatory processes                      elucidated through these studies will have general                              application to other mechanistic questions in plant gene                        expression.***//",
