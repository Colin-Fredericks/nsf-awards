 "awd_abstract_narration": "Landing proposes to investigate trace metal redox cycling               and metal-sulfide precipitation processes in the water column and               sedimenta of the Black Sea as part of an interdisciplinary                      program to study the physical, biological, and chemical                         oceanography of the Black Sea.  Since the last US expedition to                 the Black Sea  focusing on trace metals in l969 contamination                   control during the collection and handling of trace metal samples               has been greatly improved.  Work in other suboxic and anoxic                    environments has demonstrated the redox cycling of Cr, Mn, and Fe               and its effects on the distributions of other particle-reactive                 trace metals and radionuclides.  Class-B metals exhibit                         solubility and sediment enrichment patterns due to metal sulfide                precipitation processes.  Landing plans to collect water column                 trace metal samples for the selective analysis of Cr(III),                      Cr(VI), Mn(II), Fe(II), Fe(III), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(I), Cu(II),                 Zn(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II) and to quantify their distributions                  among particulate, colloidal, organically-complexed, and \"free\"                 solution forms.  Pore-waters will be collected to relate water                  column depletions of class-B metals to their sediment enrichment                patterns.  Particulate samples (suspended, sediment trap, and                   sediment) will be analyzed using a series of selective leaching                 treatments to quantify metal association with organic,                          osyhydroxide, sulfidic, and refractory phases.  The data will be                used to develop quantitative models describing trace metal redox                cycling across the oxic/suboxic/anoxic transition zone in the                   water column, incorporating physical mixing and microbiological                 transformation rates in cooperation with other participants in                  the project.//",
