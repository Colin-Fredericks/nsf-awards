 "awd_abstract_narration": "The manner in which plant phenolics determine dietary                   choices of ruminants and foragine strategies of ruminants govern                the phenolic chemistry of plants will be investigated.  Plants                  have adapted differently to the stresses of browsing and grazing                ruminants.  While the grazing interaction can be mutualistic, the               browsing interaction is an evolutionary struggle of                             allelochemicals and detoxification pathways.  Ecologically                      important allelochemicals in the browsing interaction include                   phenolics.  This interdisciplinary study of the ruminant.phenolic               interaction will involve feeding trials of captive deer and                     sheep, nutritional analyses of natural forages, and chemical                    investigations of plant phenolics and animal metabolism.                                The hypothesis that condensed tannins primarily affect                  nitrogen economy, while hydrolyzable tannins predominantly act as               toxins will be tested.  To test this hypothesis, the effects of                 tannins on grazers will be compared with the effects on browsers                with emphasis on the role of salivary proteins in tannin                        detoxification.  In addition, the effect of absorable phenolics                 on diet selection in ruminants will be explored.  Rather than                   attempt to determine the metabolic fates of all phenolics, the                  phenolic profile of various plants using a simple fractionation                 scheme based on the polarity and solubility of phenolics will be                established.  Single forage feeding trials will be used to                      correlate phenolic profiles with intake suppression, and multiple               forage feeding trials will be used to test the predictive power                 of our method.  It is anticipated that with this scheme, it will                be possible to predict which forages have complementary                         allelochemical profiles, and which will be selected as                          complementary dietary components by browsing ruminants.",
