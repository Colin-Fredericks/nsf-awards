 "awd_abstract_narration": "In walking and running, the arms and legs move like pendulums and               produce regular, repeatable intervals, like clocks do.  They also               move at the same frequency.  This research aims to further the                  understanding of the general principles behind this absolute                    coordination of pendular, clocking movements.  Experiments in                   which people will swing hand-held pendulums of variable mass and                length at their wrists will be concerned with the following kinds               of issues:  How is energy gained and lost by a movement cycle?                  How do these gains and losses relate across limbs?  How does the                amplitude of a movement cycle relate to its duration?  How does                 preferred amplitude change with changes in mass and length?  How                many between-limb phase relations are possible, and how stable                  are they?  How is absolute coordination to be defined in physical               terms?  The data will be analyzed through various formal methods                of nonlinear dynamics.  These results should facilitate the                     formal modeling of rhythmic activity.  They should ultimately be                useful in teaching various types of rhythmic physical activity                  and also in extending the basis for understanding the causes of                 rhythmic movement disorders.",
