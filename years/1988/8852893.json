 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project replaces an antiquated screw powered universal                testing machine (UTM) with a modern UTM with a capacity of 400,000 lbs.         in compression and 200,000 lbs. in tension.  The UTM is hydraulically           operated which offers more precise control that the mechanically                operated screw type.  This increased control makes it easier to control         experiments and to improve accuracy when operating in the lower load            ranges.  The UTM is equipped with accessories which provide the civil           and mechanical engineering departments the capability of testing                concrete cylinders in compression, unthreaded rods and reinforcing              bars, and flat bar specimens.  A flat bed recorder is provided to make          hard copy diagrams of stress versus strain for the materials tested.            The new UTM is also used in demonstration in the Pre-Freshmen                   Engineering Program designed to minority high school students to the            science and engineering fields.
