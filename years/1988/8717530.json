 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this Accomplishment Based Renewal proposal, Principal                   Investigator Sokal plans continued study of the various numerical               approaches to reconstructing phylogenies (ancestor-descendant                   relationships) and their associated classifications of organisms.               Sokal's past work has sought to establish the accuracy and                      stability of three different methods for ordering relationships                 among taxa (Wagner parsimony trees, maximum likelihood                          estimation, and his own creation, UPGMA, a clustering technique).               During the period of this project, computer simulations will be                 constructed for different hypotheses of evolutionary character                  change.  Between six and eight real datasets will be compared to                the simulated data, and both sets will be analyzed for stability                and accuracy using the three methods listed.                                         Systematics has witnessed the proliferation of approaches to               data analysis in the past decade, and Sokal's past work on the                  relative merits of these approaches on simulated data has had a                 wide audience.  Yet the practicing systematist is not yet able to               predict a priori which approach is the most suitable for the real               data at hand.  The proposed simulations based on current models                 of character change, followed by comparisons with real data sets,               will address this problem.  If successful, it will fill the gap                 between real and simulated data and will thereby open an area of                fruitful research.",
