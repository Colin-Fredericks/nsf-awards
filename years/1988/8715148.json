 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support continued collaborative research between a              group of U.S. physical oceanographers led by Dr. Edward Monahan,                Marine Sciences Institute, University of Connecticut and French                 colleagues led by Dr. P.G. Mestayer, Institut de Mecanique                      Statistique de la Turbulence, Marseille, France.  The research                  project, entitled \"CLUSE HEXIST 3\" is an outgrowth of the                       international cooperative program HEXOS (Humidity Exchange over the             Sea), which aims to understand the humidity transfer processes from             sea to atmosphere during gale and storm wind events, with a special             emphasis on the role of marine sprays.  One major effort in the                 HEXOS program is centered around the construction of realistic                  numerical models of the coupled transfer processes within the lower             boundary layer.  Such models are viewed as essential in the                     evaluation of the impact of sea spray on the transfer process and               as a guide in interpreting measurements.  Within the context of the             HEXOS program, a laboratory oriented subprogram, HEXIST, has been               established.  HEXIST, which stands for the HEXOS Experiments in the             Simulation Tunnel, is intended to take advantage of the unique                  capabilities of the Large Air-Sea Interaction Simulation Tunnel of              the Institut de Mecanique Statistique de la Turbulence in                       Marseille.  The transfer processes of heat, water vapour and                    spray-droplets will be controlled independently by means of the                 tunnel controls of wind speed, water, air and dew-point                         temperatures and by artificial aeration devices (spray bubblers).               Thus, the tunnel measurements will provide a test bed for models                that can eventually be extended to the open ocean.                                                                                                              In this project, U.S. and French researchers will have the                      opportunity to design a new approach to laboratory studies of spray             droplet behavior using the Marseille facility.  U.S. sensing                    technology and analysis capabilities will contribute to the joint               project.  Together with other coordinated elements of the HEXOS                 program, this series of experiments is the most comprehensive                   attack to date on the complex question of water exchange at the sea             surface.  The results of this research will have a major impact on              advancing parameterization of the water exchange process.                       Improvements in the simulation of aerosol droplets will make the                results of these experiments more directly relevant to the                      modelling of oceanic processes.",
