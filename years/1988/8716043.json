 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of their program is to carefully prepare, characterize                  and investigate novel magnetic materials and epitaxial, ultra-                  thin (1-20 atomic layers) films which are expected to exhibit                   unusual magnetic properties such as super-ferromagnetism, altered               Curie temperatures and altered critical exponents that contrast                 strikingly with bulk behavior.  They will use electron capture                  spectroscopy (ECS), which has developed into a very sensitive                   spin-sensitive method, to probe the long-ranged and short-ranged                magnetic order at the topmost layer of a surface.  Further                      magnetic studies will be performed using the magneto-optic Kerr                 effect and ion-induced emission of polarized secondary electrons.               The latter is a new, very surface sensitive technique that is                   being designed in their lab.  They also plan to advance their                   magnetic microscope towards atomic resolution.  The materials                   studied will include artificial magnetic systems composed of                    elements such as iron, chromium, manganese, palladium and                       terbium that exhibit unusual electric and magnetic properties if                deposited on adequate substrates.  Their program includes spin                  glasses, Heusler alloys and rare-earth/transition metal                         heterostructures.",
