The                State University of New York College at Brockport, in partnership               with the U. S. National Weather Service, and cable television's                 The Weather Channel, and in cooperation with the national                       newspaper USA Today, the National Earth Science Teacher's                       Association and the Commonwealth of Virginia Department of                      Education will help develop three teacher education modules and a               group of master precollege teachers and supervisors of science to               present the modules to groups of upper elementary and middle                    school teachers. The new teaching method is based on the study of               weather from the perspective of the kinds of weather information                available to the public by newspaper, television, and radio. An                 extensive pilot study will be conducted in an attempt to                        determine the efficacy of the teacher materials and strategies in               teacher enhancement activities.                                                                                                                                 A permanent weather education implementation and communications                 network will be established within the National Earth Science                   Teachers Association.",
