 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this proposal is to define the molecular                        mechanism involved in the control of endothelial cell growth,                   with specific emphasis on the role of growth-inhibitory                         extracellular matrix (ECM) heparan sulfate proteoglycans.  Acidic               fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) modulates synthesis of ECM                      components which can modulate the cell's proliferative response                 to aFGF.  Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) have been                        isolated from ECM which inhibit aFGF-stimulated proliferation of                endothelial cells.  The internalization of this inhibitory HSPG                 is enhanced by aFGF.  The aims of this proposal are to                          characterize the structures, interactions, and functions of                     inhibitory HSPG.  The regulation of incorporation of inhibitory                 HSPG into ECM by aFGF will be investigated.  The long term                      objective is to elucidate the molecular mechanism of regulation                 of endothelial cell growth control.                                                  The idea to be explored in this study is that cellular                     proliferation or quiescence is regulated by complex interactions                involving various cellular products, including microenvironmental               ECM components and soluble growth factors, all of which are                     manufactured either by the cell itself or its neighbors.  The                   results will be of great interest to all scientists studying                    cellular growth control or the interaction of cells with their                  ECM environment.",
