 "awd_abstract_narration": "The questions of how the nervous system processes information                   about the sense of touch and various levels of unpleasant                       sensations elicited by applying stimuli to the skin are poorly                  understood.  In this project the investigator will conduct a                    detailed study of how spinal cord neurons discriminate between                  such stimuli, an important part of the processing of the                        information.                                                                                                                                                    It is already known that it is possible to categorize spinal cord               neurons on the basis of the type of stimulus that leads to their                activation.  For example, some respond when the skin is                         stimulated with light touch, others when it is stimulated with                  pressure, still others when the stimulus is heat, and so forth.                 It is not known to what extent the various subcategories of                     tactile and mechanical stimuli can be unambiguously identified by               the responses of individual spinal cord nerve cells.  This is the               issue to be addressed in this project.                                                                                                                          The approach will be to record activity from many spinal cord                   neurons while subjecting the skin to precisely controlled                       mechanical stimuli.  In addition, activity will be recorded                     simultaneously from spinal cord neurons and nerve fibers carrying               the information from the skin to the spinal cord, allowing the                  investigator to discover how the neuronal signals are transformed               during processing in the spinal part of the nervous system.                                                                                                     This is very basic information with a number of implications in                 health related research engineering.",
