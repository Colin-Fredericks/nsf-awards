Participants, whose research extends over syntax,                     semantics, morphology, pragmatics, sociolinguistics, and the                    ethnography of speaking, will discuss the adequate description                  and the theoretical significance of categories in language that                 express respect and disrespect. Languages and language groups to                be discussed include Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Thai, Tibetan,                  Mesoamerican Indian languages, North American Indian languages,                 African languages, languages of India, and Western European                     languages.                                                                                                                                                      Languages express relative status of speaker and hearer and                     attitude toward the topic of discussion in many ways such as the                use of special vocabulary, pronouns, affixes, or euphemisms and                 circulocutions.  In some languages the speaker is required to                   make choices and evaluations for every utterance, while in others               there are neutral ways of speaking that avoid expression of                     relative status or attitude.  Descriptions of languages often                   omit this aspect of usage, since it has little to do with                       propositional content or abstract grammaticality.  However, a                   grammatical sentence is not necessarily an appropriate sentence.                Recently linguists have become concerned with cross-linguistic                  studies of the mechanisms of polite speech.",
