 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Wilson Botanical Garden at Las Cruces, Costa Rica is a                 tropical biological station set in a diverse mosaic of natural                  and agricultural ecosystems at middle elevations on the Pacific                 slopes.  As an increasingly important focal point for the                       training and research of U. S. and Latin American scientists, it                plays a dual role by serving as a traditional site for ecological               and systematic exploration of the premontane forests, and as a                  base for initiatives in tropical agricultural ecology and                       germplasm conservation.  Due to continued expansion of research                 and increasing competition for the limited multi-purpose space,                 there is currently a great demand for basic scientific equipment                and all-terrain transport at the site.                                               This project will provide partial funding for the first                    stage of a phased program to upgrade the facility in order to                   accommodate greater numbers of investigators for longer terms                   with improved scientific resources.  Because of its ties to a                   broad cross section of the U.S. and international academic                      communities, this facility will benefit users from an                           exceptionally diverse geographic and disciplinary spectrum.",
