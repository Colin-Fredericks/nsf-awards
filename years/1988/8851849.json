 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry is being incorporated into                 the undergraduate chemistry curriculum at both St John's                        University and the College of Saint Benedict.  The mass                         spectrometer is being interfaced with a gas chromatograph which                 was previously present.  The new system is being used to                        illustrate the principles and techniques of MS or GC/MS in the                  organic, physical, advanced analytical, and advanced inorganic                  courses, as well as student research.  All of these areas are                   being expanded and enhanced by the acquisition of the mass                      spectrometer.  Students are gaining a first hand knowledge of the               diversity of applications for a GC/MS system.
