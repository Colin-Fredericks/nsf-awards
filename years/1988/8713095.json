 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Professor Alfred G. Bishara, Ohio State                  University, to collaborate with Professor Ir. F.J.C. Rademacher,                University of Twente, The Netherlands.  They will study the                     interactions between bulk solids and hopper silo walls under flow               conditions.                                                                                                                                                     The need to do this research is indicated by the high incidence of              hopper silo structural damage and failure that takes place under                gravity flow of bulk solids.  The increasing number and size of                 silos in agriculture, mining, chemical, slipping and other                      industries makes it more important to understand the response of                these structures to various loading conditions.  Many silo                      construction codes are based on incomplete evidence for good                    design.  Professor Bishara is expert in the finite element analysis             of bulk solids silo interactions and Professor Rademacher is skilled            in parametric experimental investigations of the flow of bulk solids            in hopper silos.  Their skills are complementary and useful to the              research they have successfully collaborated in the past.",
