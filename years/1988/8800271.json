 "awd_abstract_narration": "Growing evidence indicates that spatial abilities are directly                  correlated to the foraging ecology of a species.  There is also                 evidence that foraging behaviors which require precise spatial                  memory, such as food-storing, are correlated with changes in                    the relative volume of brain structures.  The foraging                          behavior, spatial abilities and brain anatomy of three                          sympatric heteromyid rodents will be compared.  The foraging                    ranges of these species (Dipodomys merriami, Perognathus                        formosus and Chaetodipus fallax) and their patterns of cache                    distribution are to be  determined over two field seasons in a                  California field site.  Their ability to complete a series of                   mazes and to relocate their food caches using spatial memory                    will be measured in the laboratory.  Finally, the relative                      hippocampal volume of each species will be calculated from thin                 brain sections.  Thus, this study will address the question of                  spatial ability at three levels:  the underlying basis in                       morphology, the organization of spatial ability for different                   tasks such as finding food and retrieving caches and, finally,                  the implication of such differences for the structure of desert                 heteromyid communities.  The institutional site for this                        postdoctoral fellowship project is the University of                            Pittsburgh.",
