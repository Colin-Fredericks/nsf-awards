 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research is proposed to continue the study of the mechanisms            whereby heterotrophic bacterioplankton utilize particulate                      organic matter (POM) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the                  sea.  The PI is also studying the magnitude and patterns of                     organic matter flux into bacteria in both the epipelagic and the                mesopelagic zones to determine how heterotrophic bacteria may                   influence the vertical transport of biogenic production in the                  sea.  The research will focus on studying the mechanisms and                    rates of bacterial utilization of small detritus (1-50 um).  The                PI will use laboratory produced and well-characterized \"model                   detritus\" consisting of killed phytoplankton, microflagellates,                 and chroococoid cyanobacteria.  He will study colonization growth               rates of bacteria on POM and will examine enzymic mechanisms                    whereby bacteria hydrolyze POM into utilizable DOM; determine                   shifts in bacterial cell-size, growth rate, and modes of organic                matter hydrolysis as a consequence of attachment to, or release                 from, POM.  The PI asks whether a colonized particle becomes a                  point-source of DOM as well as of bacteria (\"baby-machine\").  A                 hypothesis will be tested that firm attachment to POM is a                      survival/dispersal strategy of bacteria; they survive the passage               through metazoan gut and thrive in the fecal pellets.  In field                 work using uniformly \u013114C! labeled detritus, the PI will measure                the turnover times of detritus of a broad size range, biochemical               composition, and origins.  The research proposed will contribute                towards developing a mechanistic framework for bacteria-organic                 matter interactions in an ecosytem context.  This knowledge                     should be of value in elucidating the role of bacterioplankton in               organic matter fluxes in the oceans.",
