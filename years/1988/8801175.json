 "awd_abstract_narration": "The atmosphere in regions above about 80km altitude is                     irradiated with energetic ultraviolet photons during the daytime,               and by energetic electrons and positive ions during the night in                the auroral zone.  As a consequence, many molecules and atoms                   receive enough energy to cause them to emit light, not only                     immediately, but sometimes hours later, as molecules that have                  been split up into atoms or into charges ionic fragments                        eventually recombine.  Study of this emitted light reveals much                 information on the composition, energy inputs, dynamics and                     temperature of the region.  The spectrum of airglow and auroral                 emission extends far into the infrared, and much can be learned                 from measurements in that region that is not contained in the                   visible region.  New technology has now been incorporated into                  instruments for that region, in the form of a Michelson                         Interferometer.  The development of such a system is a high                     priority for the CEDAR program, and this award is for a joint                   effort by Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in conjunction                   with Utah State University to provide it. Observations will be                  made of airglow in Utah and aurora in Svalbad and the portable                  and user-friendly system will be available for use in many places               by the aeronomy community.",
