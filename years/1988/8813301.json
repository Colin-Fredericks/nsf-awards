 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Snell proposes to study a newly described secretory event                   induced during sexual signalling in the biflagellate alga,                      Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.  When mt+ and mt- Chlamydomonas                      gametes are mixed together, they adhere to each other via                       adhesion molecules located on their flagellar surfaces.  This                   specific recognition event generates a signal, involving cyclic                 AMP, leading to activation of actin-filled, acrosome-like mating                structures and release of a metalloprotease, lysin.  Lysin is                   responsible for the release and degradation of the cell wall,                   thus permitting cell fusion and zygote formation.  Dr. Snell                    recently discovered that lysin is stored as an inactive, higher                 molecular weight, active form by a converting enzyme released                   during mating.  In the studies proposed here he will use standard               biochemical methods to isolate and purify the molecule                          responsible for conversion.  The starting material will be the                  medium collected from mating gametes that had previously been de-               walled by the addition of exogenous lysin.  Dr. Snell will test                 the hypothesis that the converting activity is a protease stored                in membrane-bounded, intracellular granules.  Antibodies will be                made against the purified molecule for use in immunolocalization                studies at both the light and electron microscopic levels.  This                work should provide new information about how signal transduction               mediated by cell-cell contact brings about a regulated secretory                event.                                                                          %%%                                                                             The process of fertilization requires that the male and female                  gamete adhere to each other and subsequently fuse.  This requires               the limited, localized breakdown of the structures surrounding                  the cells.  Dr. Snell is investigating how the interaction of the               gametes triggers the controlled and localized degradation of the                constituents surrounding the cells.  This will provide detailed                 molecular information about the requirements for successful                     fertilization in this model organism.",
