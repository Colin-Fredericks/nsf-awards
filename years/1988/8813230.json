The object of this workshop, which will follow a two day           SPIE/OSA symposium on the topic, will be to identify opportunities for          research that will provide the scientific basis for future                      interconnect technologies.  Invited panelists will include                      representatives from industry, both technical and managerial, from              government agencies, and from academic institutions.  Particular                emphasis will be given to identifying lines of scientific inquiry that          could lead to qualitatively new and interesting concepts.  The                  existing state-of-the-art will be assessed, and future scenarios                explored, with an attempt to reveal possible bridging technologies and          concepts that require further scientific investigation and to put in            perspective unresolved issues requiring further dialogue.",
