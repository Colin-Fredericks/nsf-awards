The primary activity will involve an eight week summer session                  of independent research in biological science.  A select group of               ten students, of junior or senior standing, will be invited to                  participate in the program.  Each student will be under the                     direct supervision of an LSU faculty member who will serve as the               research advisor and be directly responsible for the student's                  progress.  Faculty participants have been chosen on the basis of                their experience working with undergraduates in the laboratory,                 suitability of research projects and general research                           productivity.  Additional components of the program will be a                   formal library orientation and a series of weekly communication                 skills workshops for all REU investigators.  The program will                   also involve a weekly seminar series for all participants,                      including the faculty advisors and members of their research                    laboratories.  The latter activities will be coordinated by the                 P.I..  Upon completion of the summer research program, each REU                 investigator will present his/her research results as an oral                   seminar and written paper, the latter in a form suitable for                    publication.  A number of follow-up activities are planned to                   encourage REU investigators to present the results of their                     completed work to a scientific audience.",
