 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem of designing systems for concurrent programming is an               important area of research in computer science.  In sequential                  computers, software engineering considerations, such as the need for            abstraction and program modularity, have led to a recent increase in            the popularity of object-based programming.  Because parallelism is a           natural consequence of distributed objects, the development of systems          for concurrent object-based programming (OBCP) is likely to prove               fruitful in providing good software support for a new generation of             concurrent computers.                                                                                                                                           Research in OBCP has progressed in different areas of computer science          rather independently.  A number of new programming languages, systems,          architectures and applications have been developed in the last few              years.  Two foundational models of concurrency, namely the actor model          and Flat Guarded Horn Clauses, can be used to provide a hardware                platform for object-based concurrent programming.  A number of on-going         projects are developing object-based systems to support concurrent              applications in areas such as distributed database, distributed                 simulation, and office information systems.  Finally, work on topics            such s transactions, type theory, computational reflection and program          transformation has important ramifications for OBCP.                                                                                                            The workshop will provide the first opportunity to assess the state of          the art in research and development of OBCP.  It will also permit an            exchange of ideas on the development of common goals and the                    integration of the area as a unified field of research.  Finally, the           publication of papers presented at the workshop will make the work              easily available to researchers.",
