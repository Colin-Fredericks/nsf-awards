Simpson of  Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory, Columbia            University, New York, N.Y., and Dr. R.M. Kebeasy, Director General of           Helwan Institutue of Astronomy and Geophysics, Helwan Egypt in a                continuation of earthquake studies at Aswan, Egypt.  The Aswan Dam              and Lake Nasser in Upper Egypt in November 1981 experienced an                  earthquake of the magnitude of 5.3, which became the subject of                 extensive research due to the concern for the integrity of the Dam.             The recent African drought has lowered the water level in Lake Nasser           by 20m with a lessening of levels of seismicity, but a series of                earthquakes in June 1987 indicates the reservoir is still effecting             seismicity in the region.  Concerns exists about what will be the               effect of the filling of Lake Nasser following the ending of the                drought.  The studies seek to determine the relationship between the            hygrological conditions and seismicity in that region.                                                                                                          Scope:  This project allows four young Egyptian scientists over the             two year period, who have done the seismology field work in the Aswan           area, to come to the United States to work in the Lamont-Doherty                Geological Observatory to assist in the data reduction and complete             research relevant to the Aswan project.  Having scientists working at           Lamont, who are directly involved in data collection and are familiar           with the Aswan area will be of benefit to the overall research effort           and result.  This interaction with U.S. scientists and the training             they will receive in the U.S. are objectives of the Science in                  Developing Countries Program.  This proposal is to be funded as                 follows:  INT-$19,817 and EAR-$3,500.",
