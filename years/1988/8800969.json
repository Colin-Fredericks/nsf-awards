 "awd_abstract_narration": "The biochemical and physical organization of bacterial ice nuclei               are examined in E. coli and Pseudomonas syringae, using methods                 developed during Phase I of this grant. Many envisioned uses of                 bacterial ice nuclei require the production of cell-free nuclei                 active above -5.C (warm-threshold nuclei).  A detailed                          understanding of the structure of these nuclei is a prerequisite                for such development.  The program goals are                                      a) Investigation of the reasons for the observed Mg+2-                        dependence of warm-threshold cell-free nuclei from E. coli and P.               syringae.                                                                         b) Visualization and localization of cell-bound bacterial ice                 nuclei in P. syringae cells and subcellular fractions, by                       immunogold electron microscopy.                                                   c) Elucidation of the steps involved in assembly and                          degradation of ice nuclei, in E. coli and P. syringae, using                    inducible expression systems, and drugs which block specific                    steps of protein synthesis and processing.                                      The proposes research utilizes cloning and expression of                        bacterial genes in E. coli and P. syringae, immunoelectron                      microscopy, and temporal and spacial localization of bacterial                  proteins by established biochemical techniques.  The planned                    investigations will demonstrate which structures must be                        synthesized and stabilized to produce warm-threshold, cell-free                 ice nuclei.                                                                         Bacterial ice nuclei are of potential use to the oil                        exploration, ski slope snow making, food processing, clinical                   testing, and frost protection industries.",
