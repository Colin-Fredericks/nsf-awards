 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Fourier Transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR) is giving the                 students hands-on experience with modern infrared instrumentation and           current infrared sampling techniques.  With the spectrometer's integral         computer the students are being exposed to computer controlled                  instrumentation and computer analysis of data earlier in their course           work.  The principles introduced by exposure of students to the FT-IR           are forming the basis of explanation of other instruments using                 transform methods or which are interfaced to computers.  The                    spectrometer with its accessories is allowing the students to expand            their analysis experience with mixtures, opaque solids, powders, and            surfaces using reflectance techniques.  The aqueous liquid cell is              making possible the routine vibrational analysis of aqueous solutions.          Current experiments in the department are being modified and new                experiments are being produced for undergraduate students which are             taking into account the capabilities of an FT-IR spectrometer, computer         analysis of spectra and reflectance techniques for analysis.  The               range, sensitivity, and resolution of the instrument is also being used         by students doing undergraduate research in organometallic synthesis            and molecular structure.
