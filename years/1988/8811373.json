 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal represents a pilot project for a longer term                      research program.  The long term goal of the program is an                      elucidation of morphogenetic mechanisms in developing                           multicellular animals.  The proposed work will examine the                      morphogenesis of the primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs), a                         population of migratory cells in the sea urchin embryo.  These                  cells undergo a dramatic sequence of movements that can be                      observed directly in the living embryo.  Dr. Ettehsohn's studies                will combine an analysis of cell behavior in situ with                          biochemical and immunological approaches.  Specifically, he will                focus on three aspects cell-cell and cell-substratum interactions               during PMC morphogenesis: 1) He will examine the mechanisms that                underlie the directionality of PMC migration by a combination of                approaches, including micromanipulation of PMCs, isolation and                  modification (biochemical and immunological) of embryonic                       extracellular matrices, cell ablation, and electron microscopy,                 2) He will analyze the molecular interactions that take place                   between the PMCs and their substratum, the embryonic basal                      lamina, by using antibodies and peptides to interfere with the                  function of putative basal lamina adhesion molecules, 3) He  will               examine cell-cell interactions during PMC morphogenesis,                        focussing on the mechanism by which the PMCs prevent other                      mesenchyme cells in the embryo form expressing a skeletogenic                   phenotype.                                                                      %%%                                                                             This proposal addresses a central question of embryonic                         development: what mechanisms are responsible for organizing cells               into highly complex tissues and organs? This process is known to                involve extensive cell movements and rearrangements.  Dr.                       Ettensohn is using the developing sea urchin to examine the                     mechanisms that regulate these types of ordered cell movements.",
