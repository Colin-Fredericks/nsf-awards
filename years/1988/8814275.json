 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economic revitalization continues to be a national concern and                  considerable federal and state resources are being channeled to deal            with this issue. While much of the research aimed at this effort is in          technology development, there is a significant need for methods and             techniques for implementing technology.  This is true for both                  production and service system operations.                                                                                                                       The proposed workshop is an attempt to call upon the industrial                 engineering community to develop a research agenda for future needs in          the field.  The participants are well known and highly respected                professionals that should have the research experience and insight to           formulate the necessary avenues of investigation that will parallel             the societal needs and the intellectual core development for the                industrial engineering profession as well.                                                                                                                      The workshop is to be joint funded with the Computer Integrated                 Engineering Program in DMCE.  An award is highly recommended.",
