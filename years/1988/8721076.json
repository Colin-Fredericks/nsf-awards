 "awd_abstract_narration": "We know too little about science education.  What is clear                 is that, as science itself is affected by the society in which it               is embedded, science education is even more directly impacted by                the social, political, cultural, philosophical, ethical and                     religious views of the society which provides and promotes this                 education.  How science education is affected by these forces is                an important general question for the history of science, for the               history of education, and for science and education policy.  We                 are in great need of case studies in order to understand the                    interaction of science and society in science education.  Dr.                   Weiss is examining one of the most important cases, that of the                 impact of Nazi ideology on biology education in the Third Reich.                To understand how this ideology permeated the \"objective\"                       teaching of science in the secondary schools cannot but serve as                a clear warning about the need for enormous care in the                         preparation of our school curricula and the training of our                     teachers.                                                                                                                                                            Despite the growing interest and importance in examining the               production, role, and fate of science in the Third Reich, primary               and secondary school science education under National Socialism                 has yet to find its historian.  Dr. Weiss's study of biology                    education during the Third Reich will provide a corrective, at                  least in part, to this situation.  She will examine in detail the               dialectical relationship between biology instruction and Nazi                   ideology by focussing on three different facets of the topic:  1)               an analysis of the specific content of the biology taught in the                schools;  2) an examination of the implementation of their reform               of biology education in the primary and secondary schools; and 3)               an investigation of both the educational training and the                       political and professional outlook of biology teachers.  This                   grant will allow Dr. Weiss to finish the first phase of the                     project:  a study of biology education in boy's secondary                       schools.  The completed project will contribute to our                          understanding of the function of Nazi science education and also                serve as a model for more extensive research on science education               in general.",
