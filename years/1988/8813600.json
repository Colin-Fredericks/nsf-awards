 "awd_abstract_narration": "The reform-minded Soviet leadership is in the process of devising               a new system of economic reforms, generally referred to as                      \"perestroika\".  In the Soviet Union, proposed changes in the                    economic system require ideological justification.  An important                case in point is the Soviet experiment with a mixed economy,                    called the New Economic Policy, or NEP, from March of 1921 to the               adoption of the first five year plan in 1928.  The new Soviet                   leadership has made references to the NEP period as a possible                  model for combining market and plan.  Of particular interest to                 the contemporary modelers of Soviet economic reform was NEP's                   effort to combine private ownership in agriculture, private                     retail trade, and state ownership of the so-called commanding                   heights of industry and transportation.  Recently Gorbachev                     rehabilitated Bukharin, the chief advocate of a mixed NEP-type                  economy, particularly in agriculture and trade.  The successes of               the Chinese experiment with market forces in agriculture,                       likewise, are known by the Soviets, and changes in resource-                    allocation arrangements are a logical feature of the general                    reform package.                                                                                                                                                 This research will reexamine the NEP economy.  It will provide                  estimates of Soviet economic growth during the NEP period which,                it is hoped, will resolve the controversy in the literature over                the extent of the recovery of the Soviet economy on the eve of                  the first five year plan.  A second task will be the development                of econometric models of peasant marketing behavior during the                  1920's - a key issue of the collectivization debate of that time.               Regional and time series data will be used to estimate the                      effects of relative prices and taxes on peasant marketings of                   various agriculture products.   The most time-consuming and                     difficult part of the projected research will be the data                       gathering stage.  On the one hand, there is almost too much data                available, both Tsarist and Soviet.  On the other hand, each data               set has its flaws.  Improvement of our understanding of the                     various data sources and the quality of estimates based thereon                 is a primary goal of the study.",
