 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cis-acting sequences controlling developmental stage and                    tissue specific expression of the Drosophila dopa                               decarboxylase (Ddc) gene will be studied by in vitro                            mutagenesis of cloned copies of the gene coupled with in vivo                   analysis of the resulting phenotypes after reintegration of                     the genes into the Drosophila genome.  The enzyme encoded by                    this locus is required for the proper hardening of the                          exoskeleton at various reproducible stages during development                   and for neurotransmitter biosynthesis.  Previous work has                       demonstrated that clone copies of Ddc are correctly regulated                   when reintegrated into the Drosophila genome and in vitro                       mutagenesis experiments have uncovered some of the cis-acting                   control elements essential for proper regulation.  The large                    amount of genetic and molecular information already known                       about Ddc make it a model system for studying the mechanisms                    by which higher eukaryotic genes are regulated.  The proposed                   experiments will further define the properties of the                           individual elements and probe just how those elements                           interact in regulating the gene.  We will investigate how the                   two known central nervous systems specific elements interact                    with the other controls; our data suggest that they do so in                    conjunction with previously unknown control elements as well                    as sequences previously thought to be involved only in                          hypodermal (exoskeleton) expression.  We will use similar                       techniques to probe the spatial and functional interactions                     between the two major hypodermal elements and to determine                      whether or not the Ddc controls act as transcriptional                          enhancer.  These experiments will help us elucidate the                         regulatory circuitry that controls this gene.                                                                                                                   The regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells is                        complex.  Some factors have been discovered and investigated                    but it is clear that for genes which must be expressed at                       different times in development and whose product is needed                      for different functions, the regulatory circuitry can be                        complex.  Drosophila is one of the most powerful experimental                   organisms available for dissecting this circuitry.",
