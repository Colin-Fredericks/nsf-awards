 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purposes of this study are to increase knowledge about                 standard setting in the telecommunications and computer industries              and to contribute to the development of the body of theory on                   standard setting. The study employs a taxonomy that divides                     standard setting into classes based on (a) the extent to which                  there are strong interests in promoting the adoption of any                     universal standard and (b) whether there are vested interests in                the adoption of a particular standard. This gives rise to a                     classification in which the possible outcomes are Pure                          Coordination (where voluntary standards emerge because there is                 strong interest in adopting a standard and few vested interests),               Pure Public Goods (where there are few vested interests but small               interest in promoting a standard, so that government intervention               may be required), Pure Private Goods (where no agent wants                      standardization because there are few private benefits and large                vested interests), and Conflict (where each agent wants its                     preferred technology to be the standard).  The taxonomy is used to              guide case studies that include those involving standards for Open              Network Architectures, European telephone systems, data base                    software, the Unix computer operating system, and electronic mail.              The study identifies those factors that determine whether these                 cases involve Pure Coordination, Pure Public Goods, Pure Private                Goods, or Conflict and why different agents may prefer different                outcomes.                                                                       The study will provide important empirical information about the                rate of diffusion of new technologies and about the nature of                   competition in telecommunications and computers. Also, empirical                evidence is needed to inform theory development in this relatively              new area of inquiry.//",
