 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peaks in biogenic silica concentration in cores from high               sedimentation areas in Lake Erie and Lake Ontario provide two                   potential time horizons that will be used to tests the limits of                stratigraphic correlation in depositional basins.  The first peak               has been associated with European settlement and forest clearance               in the late 1980's and the second peak has been attributed to a                 rapid increase after 1950 in sewered population.  The causal                    mechanism hypothesized for both peaks is increased inputs of                    phosphorus and resulting increased production of diatoms until                  silica becomes limiting.  The basic objectives of the proposed                  research are to determine how the biogenic silica stratigraphy                  changes in relation to sedimentation rate and whether nutrient                  accumulation (different forms of phosphorus and biogenic silica)                varies with sedimentation rate.                                                         This research has important ecological implication because              siliceous microfossil population structure will be analyzed to                  determine if time-dependent signals are present across                          depositional basins.  In addition, the research will address                    questions about the relationship between phosphorous loading and                diatom production which may be different than reported previously               in the literature.  Thus, research on biogenic silica and                       siliceous microfossils offers promise for developing independent                time biomarkers in the sediment record and in understanding the                 causal mechanisms responsible for their presence.",
