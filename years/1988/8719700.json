 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eight large volume (100-300 km3) ash-flow tuffs wee erupted from                a series of nested calderas in the central San Juan Volcanic                    Field during a period of less than 2 million years during the                   late Oligocene (26-28M. years).  These ash flows and the                        intercalated volcanic and shallow plutonic rocks represent a                    series of stages in the development of a large silicic magmatic                 system, perhaps a batholith, in the crust of this region.  Two                  ash-flow tuffs have been studied in detail and work on the other                units is in progress.  It has been possible to estimate                         temperature, pressure, and depth, as well as water, oxygen,                     sulfur, and halogen fugacities in the developing magmas using                   analyses of the phenocryst minerals.  Numerical modeling has also               been carried out. There appear to be three major magma types                    found in this region.  The ash-flow tuffs were produced as a                    result of giant eruptions of a magnitude not observed in historic               times.  A careful study of these large volume volcanic products                 will enable comparison with plutonic systems of comperable size.                The andesitic magmas apparently are closely connected both                      geochemically and thermally with the development of the silicic                 ash flows  This work will continue the study of these rock units,               and should contribute to the knowledge of explosive volcanic                    phenomena, geothermal energy, certain ore deposits and, more                    generally, processes operating in the continental crust.                        m***//",
