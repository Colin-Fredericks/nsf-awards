 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Thomas Rossby at the Graduate School of Oceanography at the                 University of Rhode Island will undertake a project to to                       purchase and evaluate a new flextensional acoustic transducer for               possible use as sound sources for RAFOS navigation during the                   World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).  Neutrally buoyant                   drifters are planned to be one of the major techniques for                      studying the subsurface and deep ocean circulation during WOCE.                 Numerous RAFOS drifters will be deployed and set to float at                    different depths.  Their trajectories over periods of up to two                 years can be determined by analysis of arrival times of acoustic                pulses emitted from fixed and precisely tuned transducers.                      Presently available transducers work well in regional studies.                  WOCE objectives call for basin-scale studies, so transducers                    having greater range are needed.  The new transducer design makes               use of new flextensional technologies and materials.  Features of               the new system include a very high sonic power level, high energy               conversion efficiency, high bandwidth, and manageable size.                                                                                                     Once purchased, a program of testing for long-term reliability                  and performance evaluation will be undertaken.  Reliability tests               involve attaching the transducer to a mooring and deploying it at               700 meters depth along the New England escarpment.  Signals will                be received and analyzed at an established listening station at                 Bermuda and the timing of transmissions will be set to support an               ongoing long-term research project.  After six to twelve months                 of deployment, the transducer will be recovered and examined for                physical integrity and wear.  Range tests will be conducted by                  lowering the transducer package at different depths from 2800 to                4300 km away from a receiving site.  Measurements of radiated                   pressure levels will be made at each depth to understand the                    transducer's performance at increasing hydrostatic pressures.                   Transmitted signals at the varying distances will also be                       received and analyzed at the Bermuda listening station.",
