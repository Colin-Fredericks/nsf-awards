 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent research has established clearly that people can shift                   their visual attention without moving their eyes.  This research                will determine people's sensitivity to information in the path of               such an attention shift, one made without eye movement from the                 point of fixation to the location in the visual periphery of a                  target character (usually a letter or number).  In the                          experiments, attention will be summoned to the target location in               one of several ways:  (1) the appearance of the target; (2) a                   bar-shaped precue appearing near the target location; or (3) an                 arrow precue, appearing at the fixation point, pointing toward                  where the target will appear.  There will be a probe  character,                also usually a letter or number, appearing halfway between the                  fixation point and the target after a delay whose length will                   vary.  The chief item of interest will be the accuracy of                       identifying the probe character across the range of delays with                 each of the three methods of manipulating attention.  Results of                the research will help indicate whether attention resembles a                   moving spotlight, a zoom lens opening around fixation, or is                    spread out over the entire visual field.  The research will have                implications for the ideal arrangement of visual units for                      situations in which tasks must be performed under visually                      demanding conditions, such as nuclear reactor operation, flying                 an airplane, or driving a car.",
