 "awd_abstract_narration": "How people and animals learn about their environment is a major                 area of study within psychobiology.  The objective of Dr. Palya's               research is to contribute to the development of a model of                      behavior that would account for an organism's increase in                       adaptation to the environment with increasing experience (the                   \"learning curve\"), as well as accounting for a particular                       phenomenon observed in many experiments using fixed-interval                    schedules of reinforcement.  In such experiments, performance of                a specified action (or \"response\") is reinforced only when a                    specified constant interval of time has elapsed since the last                  occurrence of a reinforced response.  Given practice with such a                fixed-interval schedule, animals or people often learn to make                  few responses early in the interval and to respond at an                        increasing rate as the interval progresses, apparently in                       anticipation of reinforcement at the end of the interval.                                                                                                       In order to test theoretical predictions about the distribution                 of responding within an interfood interval, Dr. Palya will carry                out experiments using pigeons responding for food reinforcement.                Dr. Palya will experimentally segment the interfood interval into               ten different, explicitly signaled periods.  An overt response                  will be required to present or remove each of the signals                       associated with consecutive portions of the interfood interval.                 Dr. Palya predicts that the initial portion (up to the midpoint)                of the interval will be decreasingly aversive, while the later                  portion of the interval will be increasingly reinforcing.                                                                                                       Dr. Palya's prediction is based on his extension of a widely used               mathematical model of learning, the Rescorla-Wagner model, which                predicts only the behavior that will occur the moment before food               appears.  If the extended model correctly predicts the learning                 of the distribution of responding throughout the inferfood                      interval, Dr. Palya's research will have contributed to the goal                of developing a general theory of learning and behavior.",
