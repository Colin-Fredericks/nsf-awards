 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funding for a conference on \"Microeconomic               Perspectives on Aggregate Phenomena\" to be held at Northwestern                 University during August of 1988.  Topics which are likely to be                included are labor markets and intertemporal contracting issues,                financial markets with an emphasis on endogenous choice of                      security structure, long-term growth and its determinants and                   macroeconomic coordination problems.  These are all areas of                    extremely active theoretical research and experience indicates                  that bringing people together who are working on the \"cutting                   edge\" will lead to fruitful interaction.  The conference will run               for one week (five days) with three formal seminars given on each               day.  The set of theoretical topics are very important in                       macroeconomics but they have tended not to be adequately                        addressed by other week-long conferences of small size.  The                    ensuing publications should yield additional opportunities for                  interaction between researchers with common interests.",
