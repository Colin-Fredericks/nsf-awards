 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to investigate the                       fundamental issues of how to actually fuse multi-sensor data to                 represent the robot task environment.  The principal investigator               will first develop a hierarchical strategy for acquiring robot                  sensory information based on four distinct phases:  \"Far Away,\"                 \"Close To,\" \"Touching,\" and \"Manipulation.\"  Because each phase                 consists of common information and phase-specified information, the             principal investigator will package the information for each phase              into a phase-oriented distinct template.  The next step will be the             development of sensor models, sensor coordination, and fusion of                multiple sensor data. A new \"confidence distance measure\" and                   \"distance matrix\" will be used as criteria for the detection of                 sensor errors before the beginning of the sensor fusion process.  A             mathematical model will be created to represent the level of                    confidence measures for determining the optimal fused sensor data.              Following this, the principal investigator will group all                       information from the four phases to establish object information                templates and complete the representation of the task environment.              This approach permits data to be merged in both a low-level                     way (to minimize the influence of noisy data) and a high level way              (constraints are put on the influence between sensors and the way               the data is combined).  This work can potentially clear the air on a            number of issues:  the usefulness of faulty sensor isolation, the               accuracy of combined data sources, and the overall cohesiveness of              the various templates for phased sensing.",
