 "awd_abstract_narration": "The question of how large amounts of rain are produced in the               tropics without involvement of the ice phase has intrigued cloud                physicists for some time.  A field investigation to study this                  \"warm rain\" process was held in Hawaii in the summer of 1985.                       An unexpected observation from the 1985 field program was the               presence of extremely large raindrops (diameters >5 mm) which                   formed in shallow trade-wind cumuli.  This observation is                       surprising from two standpoints.  First of all, it implies a                    precipitation process which is more efficient than formerly was                 thought likely.  Secondly, previous laboratory and modelling                    studies indicate that drop break-up processes would not allow                   large raindrops to exist in as large concentrations as observed                 in this data set.                                                                   The Principal Investigators will continue their research                    using this rich data set.  Special emphasis will be placed on                   evaluating the cloud-scale environment that produces large                      raindrops from shallow clouds and to study the evolution of drop                spectra within these clouds.",
