 "awd_abstract_narration": "Forty OUTSTANDING Elementary/Middle School teachers of science will be          selected to participate in an honors program conducted over a three-year        period on the campus of Illinois State University.  This project will           develop scientific leadership for the local, state, and national level.         The participants will be: 1) honored for excellence in science teaching,        2) provided with renewal and updating in the latest scientific advances,        3) involved in analyzing science education, and 4) conducting in-               service teacher workshops in science for less well-prepared peers               throughout the State of Illinois.  The project will include strands of          computer application, teaching methodology, instructional materials             development, involvement with industrial scientists, and leadership             development in science.  The focus of the program will be the scientific        disciplines of biology, physics, chemistry, and earth science.  There           will be workshops devoted to the preparation of written computer,               demonstration, laboratory, and instructional materials designed by              participants to aid other less well-prepared teachers in improving their        science courses; these will be disseminated throughout the school               districts of Illinois and beyond.  This project will develop a strong           network of leadership in science within the State of Illinois.  This is         a collaborative venture involving the National Science Foundation, the          Illinois Science Teacher Association, Illinois State University, and            School Districts within the State of Illinois.",
