 "awd_abstract_narration": "In marine systems where high salinity, high temperature,                   low pH, or extreme anoxicity characterize the environment,                      archaebacteria (including methanogens, extreme halophiles, and                  thermoacidophiles) play a dominant role in the cycling of                       organic carbon.  Isopranyl glycerol ethers have recently been                   recognized as a characteristic morphological feature in                         identifying and differentiating archaebacteria.  In order to                    use these compounds as geomolecular markers, it is first                        necessary to understand their cycling in the environment.  Dr.                  Van Vleet proposes to investigate potential diagenetic                          alteration products of these compounds using a series of                        laboratory thermal alteration experiments and to use these                      diagnostic organic molecules to investigate their distribution                  and cycling in the Orca Basin, a well studied anoxic                            hypersaline basin in the Gulf of Mexico.                                        %%%                                                                                                                                                                  Objectives of the proposed study are (1) to investigate                    the alteration of isopranyl ether-linked lipids in the                          environment by using laboratory heating experiments combined                    with analysis of kerogen cleavage products to simulate                          diagenetic processes, (2) to examine the distribution of                        archaebaterial ether-linked lipids in the Orca Basin, including                 the overlying water, halocline, brine, surface sediments and                    selected DSDP sediments, and (3) to combine information on the                  distribution of archaebacterial ether lipids in the Orca Basin                  with data obtained from laboratory thermal alteration studies                   to eluciate the diagenetic pathways of archaebacterial ether                    lipds in the environment.  Results of this study will provide a                 basis for investigating microbial ecology in the Orca Basin and                 may also serve as a model for other marine anoxic or                            hypersaline systems.",
