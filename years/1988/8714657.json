 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of organic electrochemistry.  The                 thrust of this experimental program is to investigate the                       electrochemical preparation of strong Bronsted bases in solution                and to study their electrochemical properties and their                         reactions.  Specifically, Professor Hawley and his students will                (1) develop electrochemical methods for the preparation of the                  conjugate bases of weak Bronsted acids; (2) determine the redox                 potentials of these anions; (3) study the reactions of these                    anions with electroinactive substrates; (4) determine the                       regioselectivity of deprotonation of ambident Bronsted acids as                 well as the kinetics of isomerization of the regioisomers; (5)                  examine the regioselectivity associated with protonation of the                 ambident electrogenerated bases; and (6) explore the preparation                of electrogenerated bases that give rise to hypercatalytic                      activity.                                                                                                                                                       These studies are important to our knowledge of the thermodynamic               properties and reaction kinetics of radical ions and related                    species that lead to the development and refinement of general                  theories of electron transfer.  Additionally, Professor Hawley's                studies should be of importance to the continued development of                 organic chemistry and in increasing our understanding of many                   reactions that are extremely useful in the synthesis of new                     materials.",
