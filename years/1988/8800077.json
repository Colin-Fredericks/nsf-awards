One of the most significant scientific                        successes of the first two years of ODP has been the extensive                  programs of downhole geophysical measurements conducted during                  Legs 102, 109, and 111 in holes that penetrate deep into the                    oceanic crust. Data from these holes has been used to resolve the               physical, chemical, and hydrogeological state of the oceanic                    crust and allow data on samples from the hole to be extrapolated                to the regional scale.                                                                  The present award will support Dr. Becker at the University             of Miami to undertake a series of hydrogeology experiments during               the next two years of drilling. The experiments include a                       drillstring packer which allows sections of the hole to be                      isolated and examined for fluid flow; a large-scale resistivity                 experiment to examine electrical properties of crustal rock; and,               flowmeter experiments to monitor fluid flow into crustal holes.                 These experiments will provide essential data on the basic                      properties of the crust (permeability, porosity, and pore                       pressure) which control the movement of crustal fluids in the                   oceanic crust.",
