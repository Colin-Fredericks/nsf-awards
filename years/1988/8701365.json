 "awd_abstract_narration": "Meteorologists recognize that most heavy precipitation and severe           weather events are controlled by factors that occur on what is termed           the stormscale or mesoscale as it is called by meteorologist.  These            features have typical spatial scales of 10 to 100 kilometers and are            not well sampled by the operational weather system nor well                     understood.                                                                         In a collaborative effort with a scientist from the National                Center for Atmospheric Research, the Principal Investigator will                study small mesoscale disturbances that have been observed to develop           on large scale synoptic frontal surfaces.  The primary questions to             be addressed are the hydrodynamic mechanisms that give rise to                  mesoscale waves, their interactions with convection and their effect            on the structure of the frontal zones on which they form.  Answers to           these questions will enhance our basic understanding of the                     distribution and intensity of precipitation along frontal                       boundaries.  This investigation involves theory, numerical models and           observational analysis.  The data to be used were collected during              two field investigations focussed on mesoscale processes -- the                 Genesis of Atlantic Lows Experiment and the Oklahoma-Kansas                     Preliminary Regional Experiment for STORM-Central (STORM stands for             Stormscale Operational and Research Meteorology).",
