 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous support from the NSF has allowed the following                         objectives to be largely accomplished.  Development of mutant                   tRNA genes that would suppress termination at amber codons 2)                   Isolation of mammalian cell lines or cell conditions that                       allow efficient suppression of termination at nonsense codons                   3) solation of mutants of animal viruses with nonsense                          lesions in essential genes, and 4) the use of these reagents                    to explore the genetics and molecular biology of both animal                    viruses and mammalian cells.  Further and continuing                            objectives are to 1) develop a series of cell lines with opal                   and ocher suppressor tRNA's 2) develop an inducible                             suppressor system that does not involve gene amplification 3)                   the isolation of nonsense mutants of adenovirus and 4) to                       continue to develop methods for homologous recombination in                     mammalian cells.                                                                                                                                                Much of the power of genetic systems such as yeast and                          Drosophila is a result of the sophisticated technology                          available to investigators working with those systems.  The                     general theme of this research is to develop such methods for                   use with mammalian cells.                                                       %%%                                                                             The value of genetic systems often correlates with the                          methodology available to those working with those systems.                      The use of suppressor tRNA's in prokaryotic and yeast systems                   allowed data to be accumulated which could not have been                        otherwise obtained.  The ease with which genes can be                           inserted at the proper position in the yeast genome has made                    yeast one of the most useful of experimental genetic systems.                   The work projected in this proposal is designed to make some                    of those tools and methods available to investigators working                   with mammalian cells and mammalian viruses.  New suppressor                     tRNA's will be constructed, new nonsense mutants of                             adenovirus will be sought and methods for homologous                            recombination in mammalian cells will be devised.",
