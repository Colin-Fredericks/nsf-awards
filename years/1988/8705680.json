 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the research is to clarify dynamic factors                in chemical processes, which are stimulated by radiation, related               to plasma and reactive ion etching of metals, semiconductors, and               silicides.  New approaches will be used to study the fundamental                mechanisms using time-of-flight and modulated beam mass                         spectroscopy, pulsed ion beams or tunable dye-pumped photon                     beams, combined with modulated neutral beams to examine the                     kinetics and dynamics of these surface reactions.  Efforts will                 be made to separate the physical or thermal stimulated                          decomposition and desorption from quantum mechanical enhancement                mechanisms.  Chemical surface states induced by the radiation                   will be studied using Auger spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron                   spectroscopy and thermal desorption spectroscopy to characterize                the surfaces.  The studies will emphasize the unique chemical and               physical processes which distinguish etching reactions on                       compound surfaces from their respective elemental components.                                                                                                        Dry etching processes such as reactive ion etching, plasma                 etching, and laser etching play an important role in                            semiconductor technology by precise control of anisotropy,                      selectivity, and etching rates required for highly integrated                   circuits.  Energetic radiation (such as ion, electron, or photon                radiation) plays a crucial role in these processes, and                         optimization of these reactions can be facilitated by an                        understanding of the effects of energetic radiation on the basic                reaction mechanisms.  This research seeks to increase fundamental               understanding of these effects.  In addition, students will be                  trained in the fundamental physics and chemistry of surface                     reactions, and will be prepared to contribute to research and                   development in the semiconductor industry.",
