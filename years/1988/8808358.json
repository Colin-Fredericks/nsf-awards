 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the research is to contribute an improvement in                the quality of scientific data collected from human informants.                 The technique involved permits the simultaneous analysis of the                 competence of individuals to provide information and the accuracy               of that information taken collectively. The problem which this                  research addresses is commonly encountered in many areas of                     social and behavioral science; namely, how to measure the                       knowledge and abilities of informants when there are no                         predetermined \"correct\" answers to questions or when the correct                answers are not known by the researcher in advance. For example,                anthropologists have to deal with the problem in studying little-               known cultures or in making cross-cultural comparisons. Linguists               must cope with it in studying the syntax of exotic languages.                   Sociologists deal with it in performing research on attitudes.                  Social psychologists come across it in studying the reported                    behavior of deviant groups, and the problem also arises in                      studies involving the pooling of expert opinion for purposes of                 forecasting or policy analysis. The work to be carried out under                the recommended grant will complete the program of research                     supported by two previous grants; specifically, perfection of the               coherent set of mathematical models derived from consensus                      theory, unification of consensus methodology with latent                        structure analysis, and extension of the methodology to                         psychophysics, to such scaling situations as are found in utility               measurement, for example, and to other areas of application such                as the assessment of personal risk in decision making                           experiments.",
