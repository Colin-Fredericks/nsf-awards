 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a three-year investigation into the relationship                between the geochemical and tectonic evolution of the ocean crust               along the circum-Antarctic Plate Boundary.  This is a problem that              relates directly to the motion of the tectonic plates and to the                driving forces in the underlying mantle.  In recent years it has                become clear that the geochemical variability of basalts can place              major constraints on models of upper mantle convection by limiting the          rate of melt formation and the mechanism of melt migration through the          mantle.  The major element composition of ocean ridge basalts reflect           the composition of the residual mantle, and so determine the overall            degree of melting at the top of the ascending asthenosphere.  The               trace element composition appears to be a function of the small scale           spatial variability in the initial composition of the mantle.                                                                                                   The analysis is based on rock samples dredged from the Southwest                Indian Ocean Ridge, and the South America-Antarctica Ridge.  These              ridges are spreading at a very slow and nearly constant rate (between           0.8 and 0.92 cm/year), eliminating spreading rate as a variable, cross          two mantle plumes, and include two triple junctions.  These                     characteristics provide a unique opportunity to study the genesis of            ridge basalts and the dynamics of mantle melting by allowing the                sampling of both the products and the residue of melting of the                 asthenosphere beneath the ridges.                                                                                                                               The main objective of the program is to use the trace element                   composition of sampled basalts and peridotites along the circum-                Antarctic Ridge system to determine the variability in overall                  composition and the scale of heterogeneity of the mantle source in              various plate tectonic environments, and use the major element                  composition of the samples to determine to what extent the variability          is accompanied by initial temperature differences, and differences in           the depths of mantle upwelling and melt segregation.",
