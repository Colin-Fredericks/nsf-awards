 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with the applications of rational               Bezier patches.  Three specific problems are proposed.  The first               problem is concerned with the construction and contouring of                    piecewise quadratic, trivariate scattered data interpolants.  The               contours would be piecewise quadric surfaces and so could only be               described parametrically in terms of rational patches.  The                     second problems is concerned with when and how a rational patch                 can be reparametrized as a polynomial patch.  The final problem                 is concerned with developing a suite of geometric algorithms for                rational patches.  The results should open up the subject to a                  wider audience and help provide insight for further study, as in                the case for polynomial Bezier patches.  Undergraduate student                  involvement will be through the University of North Carolina at                 Wilmington's Honor Program.",
