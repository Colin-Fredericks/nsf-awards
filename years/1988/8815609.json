 "awd_abstract_narration": "Significant resources in research support and effort have been                  expended on the problem of earthquake hazard mitigation over the                past twenty years.  Most of this research effort has been directed              toward questions of geophysical research and structural engineering.            This expenditure of effort has been entirely appropriate in terms of            advancing scientific understanding of the underlying phenomena                  responsible for earthquake losses.  The tragic fact is that                     earthquakes continue to consume human beings.  The specific                     mechanisms of death and injury in earthquakes have not yet been                 the subject of extensive study.  In particular, very little is known            as to what distinguished those who survive from those who do not.                                                                                               As yet, there is no effective field of earthquake injury epidemiology           and prevention.  While there have been indications of promise and               interest from individual researchers in several fields, this topic has          suffered the fate of many transdisciplinary problems.  It has been              dealt with peripherally by several disciplines, but not accepted as             the central responsibility of any particular research group.                                                                                                    An international workshop on the epidemiology of injuries in natural            disasters will be organized.  The purpose of the workshop is twofold:           evaluation and discussion of existing information from past events,             and the formulation of a practical set of guidelines for future data            collection.",
