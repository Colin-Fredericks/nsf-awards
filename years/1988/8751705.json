 "awd_abstract_narration": "Teaching Physics with Technology is a modified Chautauqua type program          which will provide in-service preparation for 75 high school physics            teachers in North Carolina.  The teachers will receive training in the          use of educational technology in physics teaching.  This model is unique        in that two two-day workshops are separated by a six to seven month             period.  In the interim a one-week summer workshop is held.  The first          two-day workshop provides an overview of the use of educational                 technology in physics teaching.  The summer workshop is used to present         several mini-lessons in several areas of modern and classical physics,          and to provide time for the teachers to develop teaching modules                employing educational technology.  Teachers will work in teams with each        team producing one module.  The final two-day workshop is used to revise        and edit the modules based on classroom experience with them.",
