 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a continuation of ongoing research into the possibility                 of automatically generating user interfaces for interactive com-                puter systems.  The approach taken is to specify an interface                   formally as a relation between a source object (such as some                    information in an application program) and a view object (such as               a graphical image on the computer's screen).  This relation is                  implemented as a \"filter\"--a  program which can satisfy some con-               straint on the two objects it relates.  Filters are bidirec-                    tional:  if the source changes, the view must be updated; if the                view is edited, the system must find a corresponding change to                  the source to keep the constraint satisfied.  In previous work                  the investigators developed a formal theory of filters and a                    language for defining user interfaces in such terms.  They now                  seek to refine and extend their ideas and test them in a variety                of applications.                                                                                                                                                Success in this project would lead to faster and easier construc-               tion of computer systems which are precisely tailored to specific               needs and yet uniform in the way they interact with a user.  The                learning and use of ever more powerful and complex systems would                be facilitated.",
