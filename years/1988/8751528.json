 "awd_abstract_narration": "Students from small high schools are often educationally                        disadvantaged when they reach college because their schools                     lacked the resources required to teach those advanced courses                   that would have helped them succeed in college.  This project                   will determine whether live instruction-by-satellite is a viable                means of providing high school students with an advanced course                 in chemistry.  The opportunity will be offered to schools which                 are too small or lack resources to provide Advanced Placement                   Chemistry, but which do offer one year of the subject.  The                     format will be designed to incorporate as many of the desirable                 features of live classroom instruction as are possible.  It will                include video- and computer-based learning experiences for                      students that usually cannot be done in a live classroom.                       Students will be able to ask questions and respond to their                     distant instructor during each telecast.  They will do                          experiments in their own school laboratories and will exchange                  data using computers.  Local supervision will be the                            responsibility of the school's \"first-year\" chemistry teacher who               will interact with the University as a cooperating teacher.                                                                                                     It has recently been shown that one of the strongest correlates                 with persistence at the college level in the study of mathematics               and the sciences is the opportunity for the student to take                     Advanced Placement or Honors courses in the subjects.  By                       allowing students in rural schools to have this experience, the                 project addresses two important issues: human resources and                     equity.",
