The proposed research will examine various robot control strategies for         the purpose of developing an effective control strategy capable of              accurate error-recovery.  The proposed research was reviewed by NSF             program staff and was considered to be highly meritorious and at the            \"cutting edge\" of the computer science field.                                                                                                                   Funds provided by a planning grant will support a well-trained minority         investigator to develop a competitive research proposal for submission          to the MRI research initiation component.                                                                                                                       During the planning process the principal investigator will pursue the          following activities: participate in a study group concerned with               robotics, attend relevant research conferences, investigate the                 feasibility of using alternate hardware and software tools, and                 establish consultative relationships with research faculty.",
