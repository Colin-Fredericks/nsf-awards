 "awd_abstract_narration": "From the outset, Vaughn Jones' success, in 1981, of                        obtaining an index theory for Type II1 subfactors was recognized                as a significant advance in the theory of operator algebras.                    What was not foreseen, however, is the remarkable impact that                   this theory has had on other branches of mathematics,                           particularly on knot theory.  The operator algebraic setting for                Jones' work has revolutionized knot theory through the                          generalizations of the Alexander polynomial Jones and other                     authors have obtained.  More recently, numerous mathematicians                  have begun to recognize Jones' index theory as a powerful tool in               mathematical physics and even in mathematical biology.                                                                                                               This conference, with Professor Jones giving a series of ten               lectures, will record the advances that have been made to date,                 indicate the connections that have developed among various                      branches of mathematics as a direct result of index theory for                  subfactors, and explore the fascinating applications being                      considered in various fields by numerous mathematicians and                     scientists.",
