 "awd_abstract_narration": "Few practicing engineers and scientists, faculty, or                       students have a working understanding of the fundamentals and                   state-or-the-art knowledge of hazardous waste incineration.  The                objective of this seminar is to present a course and develop a                  problem workbook on hazardous waste incineration to address this                need and resolve this technology gap.  The course material will                 be drawn primarily from Theodore and Reynolds' 1987  Wiley-                     Interscience book \"Introduction to Hazardous Waste Incineration.\"               Problems and solutions in the workbook will be generated by an                  interdisciplinary team of engineering and applied science                       faculty.  Topics include:  regulatory considerations,                           stoichiometric and thermochemical calculations, incinerator                     design, ancillary equipment, dispersion calculations, computer                  software applications, and facilities design.  The first draft of               the problem workbook will be prepared during a two week summer                  seminar session in 1988.  The 1988-89 academic year will provide                an opportunity to classroom-test the effectiveness of the                       problems in the workbook.  A three-day follow-up summer session                 in late June of 1989 is also scheduled to provide an opportunity                to revise, update, and edit, the workbook, and finalize                         production and distribution plans for implementation in                         undergraduate engineering and applied science curricula.                                                                                                        In addition to the NSF funds, participants' institutions will                   contribute about 10% in travel costs to the operation of the                    project.  The grantee institution will provide another 20% toward               the operation of the project.",
