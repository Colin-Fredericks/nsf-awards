 "awd_abstract_narration": "Excavations conducted over 50 years ago demonstrated that the                   site of Combe-Capelle bas, located in the Dordogne region of                    Southwest France, contained rich, stratified archaeological                     materials which are termed \"Mousterian\" and date to the early                   part of the most recent glaciation.  A reconnaissance conducted                 by Dr. Dibble in 1987 confirms that the site contains both lithic               and faunal remains as well as the debris from stone tool making.                Building on this past work, Dr. Dibble and his colleagues will                  conduct three seasons of excavation at Combe-Capelle bas and                    analyze the materials recovered.  All material will be plotted in               three dimensional space and an attempt made through                             thermoluminesence dating to establish an absolute chronology.                                                                                                   The goal of the research is to gain greater understanding of the                Mousterian culture and how it changed over time.  Archaeologists                have, on the basis of tool types, defined a number of Mousterian                variants which have been accorded separate names.  However, it is               unclear what these different types actually reflect.  Some                      archaeologists have argued that all represent a single culture                  and the differences are the results of distinct sets of                         activities.  Others have argued that each variant is in fact                    produced by a separate \"tribe\".  To answer this question requires               carefully excavated, large stratigraphically secure samples which               are subjected to detailed typological analysis.  This is what Dr.               Dibble and his colleagues plan.                                                                                                                                 The broader goal of this research is to understand how humans                   developed and how modern humans are unique.  The Mousterians were               the immediate predecessors to ourselves.  Through a better                      understanding of their behavioral adaptations we can gain a                     better understanding of how we are distinct.",
