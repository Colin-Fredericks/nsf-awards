 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cephalopod theoretical morphology involves mathematical                         characterization of planispiral shell geometry.  Such analysis has              been instrumental in facilitating research on fossil cephalpood                 adaptation and evolution, particularly in matters relating to the               hydrostatic properties of the living animals.  However, this                    approach is handicapped by its strict applicability only to shells              with circular whorl cross sections.  The research described in                  this proposal will remove this shortcoming by developing equations              for generating curve area and other key geometric parameters of                 compressed and depressed shells.  In addition, this work will                   correct inconsistencies in the methods used by paleontologists to               evaluate stability and orientation of fossil cephalopods.  The                  new procedures will then be used to evaluate the effects of                     variation in shell geometry on buoyancy, orientation, and                       hydrostatic stability over a much wider range of shell form than                could be achieved in the past.  The objective is to determine how               shell compression and depression influence hydrostatic properties               of the shell.  The results of this work will substantially improve              knowledge of fossil cephalopod life habits and paleoecology, and                will make possible much needed work in hydrodynamics, locomotion,               and other areas of cephalopod adaptation and evolution.",
