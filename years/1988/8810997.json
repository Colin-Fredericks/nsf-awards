 "awd_abstract_narration": "When people are asked to do a number of cognitive tasks involving               vision, such as imaging an object or searching for a particular                 object in a large visual array, it is well known that certain                   physically measurable, \"objective\" aspects of the display, such                 as its complexity, influence how people do the tasks.  In                       addition, subjective aspects, ones that cannot be measured                      physically, such as familiarity or meaning, also influence                      people's performance.  Few experiments have separated objective                 from subjective variables sufficiently that one can tell                        conclusively which ones underly particular experimental effects.                                                                                                The experiments in this research project will isolate subjective                variables from objective variables and will examine the role of                 subjective variables in a series of visually-based cognitive                    tasks, including imagery tasks, search tasks, and perceptual                    reversal tasks.  These tasks are all potentially influenced by                  the viewer's knowledge regarding the structure of the shape to be               imagined or manipulated.  The research flows from the notion that               subjective effects in visual cognition are mediated by the                      viewer's structural knowledge regarding the particular components               from which a shape is constructed and the relative locations of                 these components; the greater the structural knowledge, the                     faster images can be manipulated, searched, and scanned, and                    hence, the more efficient the viewer's performance.  The                        experiments will test this notion and, in the process, will                     attempt to separate the construct of structural knowledge from                  that of wholistic processing and to examine the interaction                     between spatial attention and structural knowledge.                                                                                                             Finally, the research will develop a functional taxonomy of tasks               to identify the types of processing that yield subjective                       effects.  The hypothesis is that these effects will occur when                  tasks permit the mental manipulation of categorizable, basic-                   level shapes rather than requiring manipulation of detailed                     particular shapes.  This taxonomy of tasks, together with the                   construct of structural knowledge, may be useful in identifying                 the \"functional vocabulary\" of visual cognition that is employed                in real-world tasks requiring speed and accuracy.",
