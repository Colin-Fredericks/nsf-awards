 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to the University of Utah will allow the                        investigator to do ethnographic and ecological research in the                  Ituri tropical forest of Zaire.  The project will study pygmy                   hunter-gatherers to determine what cultural and ecological                      factors have promoted the establishment and perpetuation of two                 unique group-hunting strategies--bow and net hunting.  The                      project will study the geographic distribution of the two types                 of hunters in relation to forest composition and the location and               intensity of forest horticulture.  The relative efficiency of bow               and net hunting will be compared in various types of forest                     settings.  The project will acquire field data which will be                    integrated with data from remote sensing (LANDSAT) sources, to                  accurately measure the ecological situation the hunters operate                 in.  The focus will be to understand why net hunting has replaced               bow hunting in some but not all pygmy groups, and to understand                 how each type of hunting fits into the environment.                                                                                                                  This research is important because hunting groups have a                   uniquely intensive knowledge of the forest environment.  By                     studying the variation in their use of the various forest                       environments, with the precise and copious data available from                  remote sensing sources, the project will advance our knowledge of               tropical hunting and of tropical forests.  Increased knowledge of               how the tropical forest functions will help us preserve it, in                  the long run.",
