 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organic matter and nutrient dynamics in small mountain streams at               the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in western North Carolina, will               be studied.  Two factors controlling these dynamics will be                     considered - invertebrate consumer (i.e. leafshredding aquatic                  insects) activity and drought.                                                                                                                                  Leaf-shredding aquatic insects are hypothesized to be major                     processors of organic matter and nutrients in small streams.                    This hypothesis will be tested by comparing organic matter and                  nutrient dynamics in unmanipulated streams with those in streams                from which aquatic insects have been removed with insecticides.                 Part-way through the study period the insecticide treatment will                be halted and the relationship between the recovery of the                      invertebrate consumer community and changes in organic matter and               nutrient dynamics in these streams will be followed.                                                                                                            Drought conditions have prevailed at the Coweeta Hydrologic                     Laboratory since 1984, and data have been taken over this period                on stream organic matter and nutrient dynamics.  Continued                      studies of these dynamics will further document the small-stream                ecosystem responses to drought conditions; and if the hydrologic                regime should return to \"normal,\" the studies would document                    recovery of these systems from drought.  This research is                       important since very little information exists on the effects of                drought on organic matter and nutrient dynamics in streams.                                                                                                     The studies will be conducted using well-proven laboratory and                  field techniques.  Dr. Wallace and his colleagues, Drs. Webster                 and Suberkropp, have good research records and the institutional                support for the work is of high quality.",
