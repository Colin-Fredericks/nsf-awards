 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central multi-functional laser laboratory is being created.  The              laboratory is allowing the unique capabilities of laser light sources           and computer-assisted data acquisition and analysis to be realized by           undergraduate students.  The facility is providing the means to augment         the teaching of classical thermodynamics, integrating the teaching of           molecular spectroscopy across three years of study and providing an             opportunity for experimentation in kinetic studies.  Specifically the           laboratory consists of two laser light sources (an argon laser and a            nitrogen-pumped dye laser), associated optics, a monochromator, sample          holders, a detection system, and a microcomputer for experiment control         and data analysis.  The equipment is mounted on a common optical table          to allow for the modular design of experiments which share a common             source or detecter, providing an economy of scale.  The system allows           novel measurements of physical and chemical properties in ways which            more clearly elucidate these properties as well as illustrate the power         of modern optical techniques.  In addition, students' experience with           computer control and interfacing is being significantly enhanced.  It           is planned to describe the successful projects in the literature to             provide impact beyond the local facility.                                                                                                                       The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.",
