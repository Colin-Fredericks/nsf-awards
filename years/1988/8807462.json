 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in the area of small groups is important if we are to                  understand how classrooms, therapy groups, families, committees,                and friendship groups operate and how these groups can become                   more productive.  Much of the current group research uses                       theories and models developed for the study of individual                       behavior.  This individual focus is, in part, due to the current                limitation in the available statistical tools.  Commonly used                   analytic methods either ignore or treat as a nuisance the fact                  that persons interact and influence one another.  Five different                areas of investigation are proposed.  First, models will be                     developed and tested to explain the process by which members of                 the same group become more similar to one another than members of               different groups.  Second, methods to determine the ways in which               a person's behavior changes when he or she leaves one group and                 enters another will be developed.  Third, we will model the                     extent to which the norms of a group change when the one member                 leaves the group and a new person enters the group.  Fourth,                    methods to study how family members perceive one another will be                explored.  Fifth, methods to measure the extent to which                        competing groups develop antagonistic norms will be developed.                  For each area, procedures for data collection and statistical                   analysis as well as computer software will be developed.  For                   each area, data will be analyzed to illustrate the new analytic                 method.  Upon completion of this research, there will be a set of               tools that can be used to measure the process by which group                    members create norms and the extent to which these norms                        influence the group members.  The techniques can be applied in                  social psychology, organizational behavior, family studies,                     sociology and educational psychology.",
