 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project's aim is to develop a method to identiy patterns                   which represent the structural correlates of protein functional                 domains.  These will be constructed from protein primary                        sequences annotated with structural inferences derived from the                 primary sequences.  The basis for the approach is that common                   functions generally correlate with common protein structures,                   domains and/or regions of invariant or equivalent amino acids.                  This is true even for functionally related proteins with very                   different primary sequences.  The proposed method involves                      comparative analysis of sets of functionally related proteins for               a pattern consisting of elements of the common structure,                       invariant amino acids and other properties which can be predicted               statistically from the primary sequence.  The approach utilizes                 the input from the disciplines of molecular genetic,                            biochemistry, and computer science.  The project: will begin by                 extending newly developed methods, which have been proven                       successful upon initial application; and will culminate with the                generation of a pattern-indexed library of protein functional                   domain pattern descriptors.  This will be coupled with the                      software development required for their identification in new                   sequences.  The generation of this library will thus aid in the                 identification of the function(s) and domain substructure of                    newly sequenced DNA coding regions, which will be inmportant                    given the ease and anticipated rate of genome sequencing in the                 near future.                                                                                                                                                    Advances in biotechnology have led to the determination of the                  primary structure, or ordering of amino acids, of many types of                 proteins.  A computer based pattern recognition program would                   analyze known primary structures to find common patterns, and                   this information could then be applied to the study of newly                    determined sequences and to the design of new proteins with                     specific functions. This capability would increase fundamental                  knowledge in biology and lead to improved methods in                            biotechnology.",
