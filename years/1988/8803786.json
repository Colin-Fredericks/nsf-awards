 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposal for joint research with Harvard University                we request funding for the continuation of global and regional                  studies of earthquake source mechanisms using waveform inversion.               The research will cover the following topics.                                                                                                                   1.  Continuation of the centroid-moment-tensor (CMT) analysis of                    current events.                                                             2.  Utilization of the data from the High-Gain Long-Period (HGLP)                   network which operated between 1972 and 1976.                               3.  CMT and very broad band analysis of the HGLP data for selected                  events between 1972 and 1976.  This period is characterized by                  many large earthquakes lacking, so far, proper analysis.                    4.  Systematic search for earthquakes with a statistically                          significant non-double couple component.  Two events near                       Torishima Island, Japan, and three events on Iceland have                       mechanisms that appear to be consistent with magma injection.               5.  Global synthesis.  Compilation of a catalog CMT solution in a                   volume which would include discussion of the seismicity on a                    region by region basis.                                                     6.  Quasi-real time source studies.  The objective is to produce                    reliable source mechanisms one to two hours after the                           occurrence of the event.                                                    7.  Analysis of spatio-temporal distribution of earthquakes and                     its relation to tectonic processes.",
