 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work is a fundamental study of the Kraft delignification reaction          with the goal of identifying the key measurable reaction parameters             that can be used for following the progress of reaction.  A liquor-             analysis system will be used to monitor a comprehensive array of                liquor characteristics.  Depletion of active chemicals will be                  measured by monitoring in-situ the conductivity of the liquor and by            ion chromatography of the extracted liquor samples.  The quantity of            dissolved lignin will be monitored by absorbance.  Gel permeation               chromatography will be used to measure the molecular weight                     distribution of lignin.  The total dissolved solids in the circulating          liquor will be measured by using a refractive index detector.  A                kinetic model based on these measured liquor characteristics will be            developed.  The result will help develop a control system based on              measurable liquor property.  Such a control system will result in               increased productivity of the pulping operation by producing a uniform          quality of pulp at a higher yield and improve the overall economics of          the pulping operation.                                                                                                                                          The pulp and paper industry is the third largest industry in the                United States.  Even small increases in yield would have a large                dollar impact.  This work could lead to the enhanced control of the             wood chip digester thus resulting in a more uniform pulp,                       higher product quality, and higher yield.",
