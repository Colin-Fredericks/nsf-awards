 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide continuing support to the already                       established undergraduate research program at the Biological                    Sciences Department of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).  This                  department stresses a comprehensive undergraduate curriculum in                 modern biology, including strong preparation in the physical                    sciences.  The department has a long tradition of undergraduate                 involvement in research.  Over 60% of undergraduate biology                     majors at CMU do original research and more than 33% go on to                   graduate studies.  The department is therefore highly suited to                 provide a site for an undergraduate research experience.  Funds                 will be used to augment and formalize the already existing                      program.  In particular, the proportion of students recruited                   from other institutions will be increased.  Special efforts will                be made to attract minority students and students form liberal                  arts institutions.  Students with little or no prior laboratory                 experience will be provided with an intensive laboratory course                 before beginning an original research project.  A seminar series                will be given by faculty on topics in modern biology.  And                      finally, students will prepare a written summary of their summer                research and make an oral presentation at a closing symposium for               participating students and faculty.",
