 "awd_abstract_narration": "A wide-scale biogeographic pattern shows that a house gecko,               Hemidactylus frenatus, upon introduction to islands throughout                  the Pacific, replaces at least three other species.  This                       trajectory has been replicated in at least three archipelagoes:                 Vanuatu, Hawaii and Fiji.  Two of the species that are displaced                are asexual parthenogens:  Hemidactylus garnotii and                            Lepidodactylus lugubris.  This research will determine the                      ecological mechanism responsible for the displacement and the                   role played by the mode of reproduction.  Potential mechanisms                  fall into two categories:  competition and \"apparent                            competition\".  Under the heading of competition, the project will               examine hypotheses concerning exploitation and interference                     competition with a combination of manipulative field experiments                and captive experiments.  In the \"apparent competition\" category,               the potential role of parasites in the community dynamics will be               examined by screening each species for gut, lung and blood                      parasites.  Along those same lines, the clonal diversity of the                 asexual species will be both in Fiji and across the Pacific, with               an immunological technique known as the mixed lymphocyte reaction               (MLR).  Distributional ranges of different clones will be mapped                and associated with clonal differences in parasite burdens.                     Several models attributing ecological reasons for the maintenance               of sexual reproduction hinge critically on the number of                        ecologically significant clones in the asexual species.",
