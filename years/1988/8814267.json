 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will explore the electronic device potential of                          heterostructures using germanium-silicon alloys.  The investigations            to be performed will permit evaluation of the potential of germanium-           silicon heterostructures, in particular for application to                      heterojunction bipolar transistors.  Basic studies of film growth               using advanced gas phase epitaxy, including determination of critical           thickness for commensurate growth will be used.  Doping effects and             the processes of oxidation and diffusion which are not yet well                 understood will also be examined.  Abrupt multilayered structures will          be grown and a variety of analytic techniques will be brought to bear           for film characterization.  In particular, will be performed the                growth and evaluation of heterojunction bipolar transistor structures           which may be of great importance as high speed switching devices.               Research performed in this project will also permit the investigating           of the future advanced heterojunction concepts which involve the use            of sheets of dopant atoms.  These studies will advance the                      understanding of heterojunctions in general and will lead to improved           understanding of important devices.",
