 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to provide a sound theoretical                 basis for estimating gaseous emission fluxes at soil/air                        interfaces which arise from volatilization of subsurface                        contaminants, including those released at leaking or uncontrolled               treatment, storage and disposal sites for hazardous waste.                      Research on this topic involves the theoretical development of a                physically based mathematical model for predicting soil/air fluxes              of contaminants, application of geostatistical and other optimal                estimators for calibrating model parameters and quantifying model               uncertainty at the field scale, and validation of the model using               field data.  The project emphasizes consideration of the gas phase              transport and sorption processes in the unsaturated zone for                    volatile organic compounds and will explicitly represent temporal               and spatial heterogeneities in contaminant and media properties,                soil temperature changes, and determined in simulations of                      representative field conditions.  Kriging and Bayesian estimation               will be used to calibrate spatially and temporally correlated                   model parameters.  A data collection effort will supplement the                 limited field data available for model validation.                                                                                                              Emissions to the air of hazardous substances released at sites where            they are buried may pose significant environmental and health risks,            however, the current capability to assess and predict these emissions           is extremely limited.                                                           Results of this project are likely to provide a better basis then is            possible now for engineering design of soil-containment systems for             hazardous wastes.",
