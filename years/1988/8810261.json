 "awd_abstract_narration": "Odors are complex mixtures of substances.  It is difficult to                predict behavioral or physiological responses to odor mixtures                  from the responses to the individual componentsof the mixtures.                 Mixtures are often significantly less stimulatory than predicted,               a phenomenon called mixture suppression.  This is at least partly               due to poorly understood interactions that occur when multiple                  odorants activate the olfactory pathway simultaneously.  This                   project addresses this problem by considering several possible                  mechanisms in mixture suppression: namely, mutually interfering                 mechanisms of transduction by the receptors and inhibitory                      synaptic connections in the olfactory part of the central nervous               system.                                                                            The research animal is the spiny lobster, in which it is known               that receptor and central events both contribute to mixture                     suppression in olfaction.  Electrophysiological methods are used                to determine if different odor components activate opposing                     transduction processes inreceptor cells.  Similar methods as well               as cell staining and special techniques to localize the various                 substances by which nerve cells communicate with each other are                 used to identify inhibitory cells in the central nervous system                 and their connections in its olfactory areas.  Mixture                          suppression provides a specific context in which to interpret the               role of these inhibitions in recognizing odor quality.  Since                   basic molecular and cellular processes tend to be conserved in                  evolution, the results can be expected to contribute to the                     general understanding of how complex odors are recognized in                    animals other than lobsters, including humans.",
