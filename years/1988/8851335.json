 "awd_abstract_narration": "The equipment obtained through this project is enabling this               institution to provide an appropriate theoretical and practical                 background for students enrolling in  a Biotechnology minor that                addresses both the need for entry-level technicians in the growing              field of biotechnology and the preparation of undergraduates who will           go on to pursue advanced academic degrees.                                                                                                                           The new minor includes three laboratory courses (Molecular                 Biology Laboratory, Tissue Culture Techniques, and Protein Laboratory           Techniques) that are designed to give each student substantial amounts          of \"hands-on\" experience in basic and specialized techniques in these           areas.  Grant funds are being used to purchase essential equipment of           three types:  (a) small equipment needed to equip four student stations         (four students/station); (b) several intensive-use items such as HPLCs          and laminar flow hoods; and (c) specialty equipment that will introduce         undergraduates to \"state-of-the-art\" technology (e.g., a DNA                    synthesizer).  Such equipment is providing for a smooth sequence of             offerings, ranging from \"special topic\" experiences for only a few              students to the complete courses with labs that are essential to                creating a well defined curriculum.                                                                                                                                  This biotechnology program is regarded as having good potential            for becoming a national model that can be replicated in other                   institutions.  The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with           an equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
