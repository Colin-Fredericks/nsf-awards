 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies in three principal areas will be done:  (1) Viscous                     liquids, plastic crystals, and glasses, under which umbrella they               propose to refine the knowledge and understanding of fragility in               liquids, and to invoke the comparable phenomenology of plastic                  crystals, specifically seeking plastic crystals with \"fragile\"                  behavior.  A particular note is made of the challenge of systems                with slow structural degrees of freedom which couple only weakly                to the viscoelastic modes.  Finally, they identify the area of                  octapolar glasses as one worthy of attention:  (2) Liquids at                   negative pressure, in which area they wish to investigate                       physicochemical properties of liquids when in a state of tension;               they also propose molecular dynamics studies invoking negative                  pressure rupturing of initially normal liquid structures to                     produce and then study fractal structures and dynamics:  Finally                (3) they outline several problems in geochemical liquid and                     glass research.  They propose both experimental and computer                    simulation studies in this area.",
