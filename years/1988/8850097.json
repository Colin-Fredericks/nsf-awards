 "awd_abstract_narration": "The State University of New York/College at Old Westbury will implement         a two-year project to create the Long Island Mathematics Enrichment             Institute for High Ability or High Potential Young Women.  The proposed         effort will be established in collaboration with the Nassau County              Mathematics Association, the Suffolk County Mathematics Association,            and the Nassau County Mathematics Supervision Association.  For each of         two fifteen-Saturday morning cycles Old Westbury will work with twenty-         five high ability or high potential 10th or 11th grade young women per          semester in the region.  During the academic year, young women will             participate in career awareness sessions, consciousness-raising                 efforts, role model lectures, motivational workshops and specialized            mathematics instruction.  Attendees will undergo sixty hours of                 academic year project activities, and 12 hours of Summer follow-up              exposure.                                                                                                                                                       Participants will share Institute training and motivation with                  classmates in school districts.  Videotaping of workshops/seminars will         afford teachers the opportunity of viewing presentations with                   nonparticipating students. A \"how to\" replication manual after Year II          will be available for national replicability.  Four hands-on research-          oriented field visits/demonstrations during high school intersession            breaks will complement academic-year efforts.  Parental involvement in          workshops, a mentoring component and career planning sessions add a             necessary dimension to Institute design.",
