 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the last nineteen years, the principal investigator, his co-             workers and students have conducted research in the qualitative                 analysis of complex dynamical systems.  A great deal of this work is            concerned with Lyapunov stability, Lagrange stability, input-output             properties, well-posedness, existence and stability of periodic                 motions, decomposition, topological properties, and selected                    applications of interconnected dynamical systems.  He proposes to               continue his investigations of complex dynamical systems along the              following lines:                                                                                                                                                1.      Study qualitative properties of hybrid dynamical systems with an        emphasis on digital implementations of dynamic controllers in digital           feedback control systems.                                                       2.      Study the Lyapunov stability of infinite dimensional dynamical          systems, using decomposition techniques (e.g., transformation into              systems in block lower triangular form having strongly connected                components as subsystems), and he proposes to emphasize toxic waste             models in this work.                                                            3.      Views in neural networks as interconnected dynamical systems,           study qualitative properties as well as synthesis procedures for                several models of neural networks.                                              4.      Using recent results for Hamilton-like variational methods of           nonconservative dynamical systems, study power system models which              include transfer conductances; he aims to provide analytical                    justification for several existing heuristic results which make use of          path dependent energy functions for such systems.                               5.      Continue research on existence, nonexistence, stability and             instability of periodic motions in complex dynamical systems.  He is            particularly interested in establishing rigorously the validity of              various describing function methods.                                            6.      Apply interval analysis techniques in the study of dynamical            systems.  The emphasis will be on parameter tolerance problems.                 7.      Study the stability of controlled viscoelastic structures using         fractional time derivatives in the model formulation of the plant.                                                                                              These topics are clearly of great importance in theoretical studies as          well as in applications.  His methodology will involve functional               analysis techniques, results from Floquet theory, invariance and                comparison theory for differential equations, Lyapunov stability                theory (for finite and infinite dimensional systems), I/O stability             theory, interval analysis, etc.",
