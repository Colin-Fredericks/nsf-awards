 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Partnerships in Field Research and Curriculum Enhancement project is        designed to stimulate renewed interest in and improve the teaching of           science at the precollege level by providing opportunities for K-12             teachers to join University of California (UC) scientists on field              research projects in the natural and social sciences.                                                                                                           Workshops conducted before the field activities will provide an overview        of each of the disciplines involved, major developments and current             directions.  Teacher participants will then join U.C. field teams for           two to four week periods in the summer on research projects in the              United States and abroad.  They will live with the scientific team at           the field site, be instructed in basic field methods, and take an active        part in data collection and analysis.  After returning from the field,          teachers will develop classroom curriculum materials based on their             field activities.  A series of academic-year workshops led by university        scientists and curriculum specialists will provide assistance in                curriculum development.  Curriculum units developed by the teachers will        be disseminated to interested educators through a teacher Research              Resource Library.                                                                                                                                               The program is planned to operate over a 3 year period.  Approximately          100 teachers will participate.  The program's impact will be extended           through teacher presentations of field research experiences and                 dissemination of the curriculum materials.                                                                                                                      This project allows the Teacher Enhancement Program the opportunity of          placing teachers (K-12) in research situations.  Subsequently the               participants will plan teaching strategies to incorporate their research        experience into classroom activities.  Since many teachers have not been        involved in research activities of any type, this type of program should        result in a substantial change in doing science in the classroom.",
