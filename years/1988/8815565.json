 "awd_abstract_narration": "The area of expert system application to power system problems is               fairly new.  Some interesting applications and methodologies have been          developed over the last several years: for example, power system fault          location, alarm interpretation and reduction, operation and control,            etc.  Implementation of expert systems in the real-world control                centers is being performed in Japan and the U.S.  The area of expert            systems was one of the ten critical areas selected for discussion in            the NSF Power System Workshop in Tempe, Arizona, in April 1987.                 Although progress has been made in the field, many fundamental issues           remain to be investigated.  The Symposium is organized by the Royal             Institute of Technology, Sweden, with University of Tokyo, Japan, and           University of Washington, Seattle, U.S.A. as co-organizers.  The                International Advisory Committee of the Symposium is chaired by                 Professor Y. Sekine. C. C. Liu, the proposer, is serving as a vice-             chairman and the U.S. representative on the committee.  According to            the preliminary program a total of 89 papers will be presented in 18            sessions.  The authors come form 21 countries throughout the world.             Besides the U.S. papers there is an enthusiastic participation from             other countries:  Japan (17), Scandinavia (14), United Kingdom (5),             Holland (4), France (1), Germany (1), etc.  The Symposium covers                various aspects of expert system related to power systems:  from basic          methodolgies to expert systems for specific functions in power system           planning and operation.  Both industry and universities are well                represented according to latest registration figures.",
