 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Whittier Narrows earthquake offers an opportunity to assess the             impact that research conducted as a result of the 1971 San Fernando             earthquake has had on the earthquake design and performance of                  lifelines.  The San Fernando earthquake was a major turning point in            the seismic design of these systems, and Los Angeles has had the                opportunity to benefit from research conducted in this area.                    Therefore, collecting response and recovery data from the Whittier              Narrows earthquake would not only allow the preservation of important           but perishable data, but also an assessment of research application             and effectiveness.                                                                                                                                              The objectives of this proposed study are to (1) collect, review, and           document lifeline system performance (i.e., response and recovery)              data from the October 1, 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake; (2) develop          preliminary response and recovery models for different lifeline                 systems using data from the Whittier Narrows earthquake and the 1971            San Fernando earthquake; and                                                    (3) assess the impact that research in the lifelines area conducted             after the 1971 San Fernando earthquake has had on the improvement of            seismic design and emergency response and preparedness procedures for           lifelines.  Specific tasks that will be performed include (1) data              collection and review; (2)                                                      interviews with lifeline personnel; (3) development of                          preliminary response and recovery models; (4) comparison of                     lifeline response and recovery performance during 1971 San                      Fernando earthquake and 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake; and                   (5) assessment of impact of research conducted after 1971 San                   Fernando earthquake on seismic design and performance of                        lifelines.",
