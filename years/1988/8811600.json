 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is in the area of high-temperature                   ceramic superconductors involving the production of a                           superconducting fiber and further to produce a superconducting                  cable from a collection of superconducting fibers.  For the                     production of superconductive fibers a new piggyback process is                 employed.  Hollow or c-shaped carbon fibers serving as micromolds               are dipped in a ceramic precursor, then dried and fired.  Through               atmospheric control, either ceramic or ceramic/carbon fibers                    result.  The presence of carbon promotes added strength,                        toughness, abrasion resistance, and crack resistance in the                     fiber.  Precursors can be either of the wet chemical (sol-gel)                  type or particulate suspensions.  Both methods will be examined.                                                                                                The most difficult aspect of the procedure is the determination                 of an adequate firing schedule.  Production of bicomponent fibers               (ceramic/carbon) will be investigated first.  Although ceramic                  superconductors are usually formed at high temperatures, recent                 experiments indicate that formation reactions take place at                     fairly low temperatures.  Both high and low temperature                         formations will be investigated.                                                                                                                                This project involves a comprehensive interdisciplinary approach                which includes knowledge of fiber physics, textile science,                     mechanical engineering, solid state chemistry, and ceramic                      engineering and processing.",
