 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thirty Middle School teachers from the public and private schools               of Region 20 and Northside Independent School District in the San               Antonio, Texas area will be given the opportunity to participate                in a graduate Summer Institute utilizing the innovative \"trainer                of trainers\" approach toward enhancing field and classroom                      instruction in geology.                                                                                                                                         Prior to the three-week Institute, meetings will prepare                        participants for the course work, provide interaction with                      university faculty and introduce the \"training of trainers\"                     program. Field work, lecture and \"hands-on\" application will                    target essential elements of earth sciences which have been                     already identified by teachers in this region as requiring                      attention.                                                                                                                                                      A field trip to the Black Hills will introduce the teachers to a                stratigraphy that exists in Texas, but is scattered around the                  state making it difficult to study in a short period of time.                   This site will make the segmented Texas geology more available                  and comprehensible to the teachers. This experience will enable                 them to develop good field trip experiences for their students at               more home-based sites.                                                                                                                                          Approximately 60% of the participants will be from campuses with                more than 65% minority students. During the year following the                  summer component, participants and universtiy faculty will                      evaluate the results of the program and develop a package                       consisting of a teaching manual and video recordings for use in                 future training of teachers.  Both pedagogy and content will be                 emphasized in this project.",
