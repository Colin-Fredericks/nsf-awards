 "awd_abstract_narration": "The relationship between form and substance has long intrigued                  historians and philosophers of science and technology.  To what                 extent does a scientific theory affect and, more provocatively,                 is it affected by the form in which it is presented?  Dr. Broman                is studying the connections between form and substance in his                   study of biological theories and the genres in which they are                   presented.  He will seek to learn what kinds of problems were                   handled in different genres, how those genres were structured,                  and how information moved between them.  He will make a close                   reading of the logical and rhetorical structure of these writings               with the aim of discovering the explicit and implicit \"rules of                 scholarship\" contained in different genres.  Finally, he will                   attempt to demonstrate the extent to which these literary                       structures determined what sort of physiological theories could                 be articulated by them.                                                                                                                                         The specific context in which Dr. Broman will examine these                     questions is a study which seeks to connect the changing                        physiological theories between 1750 and 1820 with the                           introduction of new genres of medical writing during the same                   period.  At the level of theory, the change was from functional                 explanations of anatomical structures to two new areas of                       interest:  morphological studies of the laws of animal form and                 theories emphasizing regulation of vital processes.  At the level               of writing, doctoral dissertations rapidly fell after 1800 while                journals publishing reports of empirical research established                   themselves as a new genre in biological scholarship.  His                       argument is that the old genre made presentations of empirical                  research more difficult while the new one facilitated it.                                                                                                       This  study will greatly help historians and philosophers of                    science to understand the constraints of form on the substance of               scientific thought and how science moves to adopt new forms when                necessary.  Dr. Broman will undertake this research under the                   guidance of Dr. Frederic L. Holmes at Yale University.  Dr.                     Holmes' experience in studying the detailed methodologies of                    practicing scientists will provide Dr. Broman with a much needed                grounding in the \"substance\" whose form of communication he                     wishes to examine.",
