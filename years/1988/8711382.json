 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intra-arc basins are important but are little-studied                   component of complex island arc systems at consuming plate                      margins.  These basins commonly mark the sites of important                     tectonic features such as major strike-slip faults, incipient                   rifts, or trapped fragments of ocean crust.  The lack of                        investigation of these basins has resulted in an inadequate                     appreciation of their significance, in both modern and ancient                  arc terrances.                                                                          In this award the investigators would study several marine              and non-marine intra-arc basins in the Central Philippine                       archipelago.  They will use a combination of marine geophysical                 and geological tools such as SeaMarc II Sonar, Single Channel                   Seismic profiler, Piston corer, etc., along with land                           geological survey techniques.                                                           This investigation will focus on the present-day tectonic               setting and detailed structural evolution of basins, as well as                 on their stratigraphic and sedimentologic histories, and the                    spatial and temporal relations between sedimentation, volcanism                 and tectonism.  The study is intended to solve regional                         problems, and to contribute to the general understanding of                     processes of internal disruption and sedimentation in island                    arcs, and to develop practicable criteria for identifying                       intra-arc basins in ancient, accreted arc terranes.  The                        investigators have an excellent record of working in the                        Philippines water and the project has very high chances of                      being successful.",
