In ENCOMPASS, software is specified using PLEASE \u013180,81,83,84!         an executable specification language which builds on logic-programming          and database technology.  In ENCOMPASS, PLEASE specifications are               incrementally refined into Ada implementations; refinements can be              verified using testing, peer review or proof-based techniques.  PLEASE          supports the rigorous development of software: parts of a system can be         developed using completely formal methods, while other, less critical           parts are constructed using less expensive techniques.  Systems can be          constructed using all the features of Ada, although at present not all          Ada constructs can be formally analyzed.  The next phase of this                research will extend the formal description of both PLEASE and the              development process based on it; study the efficiency and scalability           of the technologies used to implement PLEASE and ENCOMPASS; investigate         the use of PLEASE in the development of large and parallel programs;            and extend ENCOMPASS with more sophisticated, knowledge-based tools.",
