 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because of the extraordinarily large size of its nervous system                 cells (some of which are almost a millimeter in diameter|) and                  the ability to recognize these cells as unique individuals, the                 sea hare (a mollusc, Aplysia) has proven extremely useful for                   studying the properties of individual cells, the patterns of                    interconnections, modulation of synaptic strength, behavior,                    learning and development.  The most fundamental advances in our                 understanding of the human nervous system largely began with                    studies of animals with very simple nervous systems, such as                    Aplysia.  The purpose of this meeting is to bring together, for                 the first time, the Aplysia neurobiology community throughout the               world and to initiate meetings that will subsequently be held in                alternate years.  The first meeting will provide a format for                   discussing new methods and findings that have emerged in the cell               and molecular biology of Aplysia.  These findings will be                       considered in seven different sessions, each concerned with a                   different level of analysis:                                                                                                                                              1.   Ion channels and channel modulation                                        2.   Peptides, small molecule transmitters,                                          and synaptic transmission                                                  3.   Cell imaging                                                               4.   Circadian rhythm                                                           5.   Neuronal circuitry and behavior                                            6.   Learning                                                                   7.   Development                                                                                                                                      This symposium represents an unique opportunity to determine the                direction of invertebrate research well in to the next decade.",
