 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantitative paleocurrent/paleoslope analysis, one of the most             powerful tools in the study of sedimentary basins, has not been widely          applied in problematic metasedimentary basins within mountain belts.            This award will confront some of the analytical difficulties which have         discouraged such work, in the context of a regional survey of                   paleocurrent and paleoslope directions in the Maine Appalachians.  We           introduce innovative approaches in two problem areas:  retrodeformation         of directional indicators, and kinematic analysis of soft-sediment              deformation structures.  A rational approach to retrodeformation of             directional indicators is illustrated in terms of bedding pole paths            during deformation, and a broad selection of possible tilt-correction           paths is thereby revealed.  A simple orthographic construction for              strain correction of directional indicators is proposed to supercede            comparable but more complex stereographic constructions proposed in             the early 1960's by Ramsay.  Proposed innovations in kinematic analysis         of soft-sediment deformation structures include slump fold vergence as          a more powerful alternative to the separation arc and mean axis                 methods, and the use of displacement stereovectors to better exploit            available information from soft-sediment faults.  The proposed                  research will thereby introduce several recent advances of structural           analysis to the sedimentological community.  An important by-product of         our work will be the development of a user-interactive Macintosh                software package for paleocurrent and paleoslope analysis, which will           ensure that the more difficult and/or laborious new procedures will be          accessible to non-specialists.",
