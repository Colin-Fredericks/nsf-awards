In this detritus.based ecosystem, lignocellulose from                 the emergent Macrophyte \u001aCarex\u001a \u001awalteriana\u001a is the most abundant               source of carbon.  Since lignocellulose is largely indigestible                 to animals they cannot use its carbon (energy) until it is                      degraded by microorganisms.  Thus, having an understanding of                   microbial transformations of lignocellulosic material and the                   factors controlling rates of its breakdown are key to                           understanding how the Okefenokee and other wetland ecosystems                   work.                                                                                                                                                           The research will be divided into three parts; detailed process                 studies, integrative system.level measurements, and modeling                    syntheses.  The detailed process studies will focus on                          decomposition in field and laboratory efforts designed to                       clarify the temporal and spatial aspects of transformations,                    fate, and controls on decomposition not only of lignocellulosic,                but also of non.lignocellulosic carbon.  Techniques to be used in               these studies include: the radiolabeling of substrates with .1.4C               to determine the fate of the decomposed material; and the                       labeling of bacteria with \u0131.3H! thymidine to determine the                      efficiency of particle incorporation.                                                                                                                           The system.level measurements are designed to put the                           decomposition studies in context of the site's overall carbon                   budget.  Standard methods including flow.through metabolic                      chambers and .1.4C \"spiked\" light.dark bottles will be used in the              system level studies.                                                                                                                                           Modeling will function as a synthesis tool in this research.                    Extant models of microbial degradation of lignocellulose will be                expanded to: 1) consider spatial and temporal aspects of decay                  related to detrital inputs; and 2) incorporate more explicit and                detailed controls on rates of decay including the influence of N,               P and S.  Finally, detailed flow and sensitivity analyses will be               made of the modified models.                                                                                                                                    The significance of this research is that it will help us to                    understand how wetlands, a major ecosystem type, worldwide,                     function.  This research should provide a scientific basis for                  wise management of this important landform.                                                                                                                     Drs. Hodson, Wiegert and Hopkinson are very capable scientists                  with strong research records.  The institutional support                        available to them is excellent.",
