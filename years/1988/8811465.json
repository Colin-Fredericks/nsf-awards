 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant cells synthesize a variety of defense compounds upon                      stimulation with pathogen-derived or plant cell wall-derived                    molecules termed elicitors.  While much is known concerning the                 nature of these elicitors and the types of defense molecules                    produced in response to elicitation, virtually nothing is known                 about the sequence of events involved in transducing the                        extracellular elicitor signal into the cell's nucleus.  The                     objective of this research is to identify those signal                          transduction and amplification processes which occur at the                     plasma membrane during elicitation.  Using signal transduction                  pathways in animal cells as models, the goals of this project are               to evaluate the possible participation of the following signaling               mechanisms during elicitation of phytoalexin formation:  1)                     calcium transport, 2) proton transport, 3) changes in membrane                  potential, 4) changes in trans-plasma membrane dehydrogenase                    activity, and 5) changes in phosphatidylinositol turnover.                      Emphasis will be placed on mechanisms 1, 2, and 3.                                                                                                              A detailed understanding of signal transduction processes in                    plant cells is of great intrinsic interest and may eventually                   contribute to the rational design of strategies for manipulating                the various defense and growth responses in plants.",
