 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will evaluate the characteristics and capabilities                 of the world's largest SWATH ship, the Japanese vessel KAIYO.                   Because of its superior seakeeping characteristics, the SWATH                   (Small Waterplane Area Twin Hull) is of considerable interest to                the oceanographic community as a platform for ocean science                     research.  The SWATH shows promise of taking science into adverse               sea conditions currently inaccessible to conventional monohull                  designs.                                                                                                                                                        This study will be the most extensive SWATH performance                         evaluation ever conducted.  It will examine the ship's structural               integrity, its acoustic and vibration transmission                              characteristics, its sea keeping and maneuvering ability in a                   variety of sea conditions including validation of and correlation               with scale model tank tests.  It will evaluate the ship's utility               as a platform for a variety of ocean science research and the                   long term effects of the SWATH's motions on personnel.                                                                                                          The project will gather data on SWATH ship design essential to                  long range planning for new ship construction and to the proper                 and safe management of the academic research fleet.  The                        knowledge gained will be of great benefit to ocean science                      planning and assessment activities of National Science                          Foundation, the Office of Naval Research, the Naval Sea Systems                 Command, other Federal agencies, the University-National                        Oceanographic Laboratory System and the academic science                        community.                                                                                                                                                      Through a Memorandum of Understanding between the Naval Sea                     Systems Command (NAVSEA) and the National Science Foundation                    (NSF), NAVSEA will provide funds to NSF for this \"SWATH RESEARCH                VESSEL EVALUATION STUDY\" to be carried out under the direction of               Dr. George D. Grice, Associate Director of the Woods Hole                       Oceanographic Institution.                                                                                                                                      The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will be responsible for                overall project management including subcontracts to provide                    engineering and technical expertise.",
