 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the experiments proposed is to elucidate                       mechanisms of peptide and protein export in bacteria.                           Specifically, the system to be used is the export of Microcin                   B17 (MccB17), a peptide antibiotic produced by E. coli.  Six                    genes, mcbB through mcbG, are necessary for production of and                   immunity to MccB17, itself the product of mcbA.  The                            antibiotic acts on sensitive enteric bacterial cells to block                   DNA replication.  The mcbE and mcbF gene products appear to                     mediate export of MccB17; mutations in mcbE and mcbF and                        extragenic suppressors thereof will delineate the roles,                        interactions, and functional domains of these components of                     the MccB17 export machinery.  Intracellular and extracellular                   MccB17 will be characterized by biochemical and cell                            fractionation studies and by electron microscopy.  Mutations                    in the MccB17 molecule that prevent its export will identify                    functional domains for transport; extragenic suppressors of                     these mutations that allow export of the altered peptide will                   identify interactions between the exported peptide and the                      proteins necessary for its export.%%%                                                                                                                           Dr. Skvirsky is establishing herself as an independent                          investigator through this Research Opportunities for Women                      Research Initiation award.  The work promises to be                             interesting because export of proteins to the exterior of the                   cell is rare in the bacterium E.coli.  The information                          obtained in these studies will have numerous possible                           practical applications to the commercial production of                          products of cloned genes in bacteria.***//",
