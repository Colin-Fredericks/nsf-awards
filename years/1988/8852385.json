 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Marine Science Department recently developed an area of               emphasis in Marine Analytical Technology (MAT), the aim of which is to          produce environmental technicians.  Particular emphasis has been given          to acquisition of organizational and analytical skills needed to                monitor environmental quality and to assess the impacts of pollutants.          This grant provides funds to purchase equipment needed to measure a             variety of federally-recognized Priority One Pollutants using methods           approved by the Environmental Protection Agency.  The equipment                 required is a gas chromatograph for pesticide, PCB and PAH analysis, a          graphite furnace for heavy metal analysis, and a silica cell for                petroleum-hydrocarbon fingerprinting.  The latter two pieces of                 equipment are accessories to equipment already on hand, i.e. an atomic          absorption spectrophotometer and an infrared spectrophotometer,                 respectively.  The machines will be used in laboratory courses                  required in the MAT program, as well as in elective courses and in              undergraduate independent research projects.                                                                                                                         The increasing amounts of environmental management being conducted         in this country and worldwide assure a large ongoing demand for well            trained environmental technicians.  Thus this project is significant in         that it supports a program expressly designed to teach students highly          marketable science/technology-based skills that can be acquired during          the undergraduate years.  The grantee institution is matching the NSF           award with a slightly greater sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
