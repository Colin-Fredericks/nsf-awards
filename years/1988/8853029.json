 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economics is a difficult subject to learn.  Undergraduates                 often fail to grasp the fundamental concepts and relationships of               the discipline and seldom develop the basic skills of economic                  anaalysis.  The three major reasons for this are the mathematical               nature of the discipline, the perceived abstract nature of the                  subject and the level of statistical sophistication necessary to                perform even fairly simple analysis.                                                 This project exploits the educational capabilities of the                  microcomputer to minimize these obstacles. Software and data                    bases tailored to the level of sophistication of the students are               used in a twenty one workstation laboratory purchased by this                   award for the introductory courses, four specialized upper                      division courses, and, in the future the bulk of the remaining                  upper division coursers.  In addition an entirely new course has                been developed using the work stations. Drill and practice are                  avoided, economics skills are developed throughout the entire                   undergraduate economics curriculum.  The award will be matched by               an equal sum from the grantee.",
