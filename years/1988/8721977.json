 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a three-year study of the thermal, mechanical, and              electrical characteristics of sea ice as evolutionary functions of the          environmental ice growth conditions.  The characteristics of sea ice            are complex, depending on external factors such as air and ocean                temperature, ocean salinity, dissolved gas content, winds and currents          at the ice/ocean interface, as well as the immediate ice growth                 history itself.  At this time the theoretically defined models of sea           ice growth and development cannot be adequately tested, because                 independently derived data is not available.                                                                                                                    The principal investigators have developed a sea ice simulation model           that takes a representative set of meteorological and oceanographic             conditions and estimates not only the ice profile properties, but also          the composite characteristics of sea ice sheets that have formed under          a wide range of environmental conditions.  The field phase of this              project, to be carried out on the sea ice off Barrow, Alaska, includes          the measurement of growth, structure and property profiles of                   undeformed first-year sea ice.  Several times during the growing                season ponds will be cut in order to stimulate the growth of new ice.           The measurement program will track the changes in growth and                    characteristics through the entire cycle from formation to                      deterioration and melt in the following Spring and Summer.  Supporting          observations of the meteorological and oceanographic conditions will            also be made.",
