 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research proposed will extend the PI's recent findings              that larval settlement of the coral, Agaricia agaricites, is                    specifically induced by a biochemical factor associated with                    certain cructose coraline red algae (CCA).  The proposed research               involves studies at the molecular level used to resolve chemical                cues controlling larval settlement in the field.                                                                                                                        The specific objectives of the proposed research are:  (1)              to identify the biochemical inducers of settlement and                          metamorphosis of the coral larvae, from identified inductive                    species of CCA; (2) to determine the basis for the algal                        specificity to the coral larvae; (3) to determine whether the                   identified biochemical cues purified from CCA and found capable                 of inducing settlement and metamorphosis in the laboratory                      actually do so in the field; and (4) to determine the                           contributions of such biochemical cues to the control of                        settlement in the field relative to other environmental                         parameters.                                                                                                                                                             The significance of this research is to assess the                      contribution of larval recognition of natural chemical cues for                 settlement and metamorphosis in determining patterns of                         recruitment.  This research is a first step in differentiating                  between ecological and molecular (\"marine biotechnological\")                    factors controlling settlement, metamorphosis and recruitment of                marine invertebrates.",
