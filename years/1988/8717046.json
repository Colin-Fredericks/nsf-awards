 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project in Experimental Physical Chemistry is designed                  to elucidate the flow of vibrational and rotational energy when                 it is deposited in isolated molecules which have been cooled to                 low temperatures by free-jet expansion.                                                                                                                            Dr. J. D. McDonald will conduct a variety of experiments                     using a combination of laser spectroscopic and free-jet                         expansion techniques to probe the intramolecular vibrational                    relaxation process.  One experiment will use visible or                         ultraviolet stimulated emission pumping spectroscopy to measure                 the spectrum of molecular eigenstates in the ground electronic                  state of alpha-dicarbonyl molecules.  A second experiment will                  use infrared pump-visible probe double resonance to gain                        similar information and to learn about the nature of the                        relaxed \"bath states\" by studying the visible fluorescence of                   the excited molecules.  A third experiment will probe a                         different subset of the bath states in the same molecules as                    the previous experiment by spectrally resolving their infrared                  fluorescence.  The last experiment will attempt many of the                     same types of studies with time resolution on a picosecond                      scale.  Collectively these four techniques will provide a very                  complete view of the intramolecular vibrational and rotational                  relaxation process in several molecular systems.",
