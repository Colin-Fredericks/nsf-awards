 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study examines the nature and extent of intergenerational change           among variously disaffected members of the Soviet population in regard          to their support for political institutions.  The investigators                 reanalyze data from the \"Harvard Project\" of Soviet refugees, which was         conducted in the early 1950's, and replicate and reassess some of the           key findings of the original analysis.  In addition the project draws           on two surveys of Soviet emigrants from the late 1970's and early               1980's:  the Soviet Interview Project (SIP) General Survey I and the            follow.up SIP General Survey II.                                                The findings of the Harvard Project revealed a significant generation           gap in the way people viewed the Soviet system under Stalin.  The young         and highly educated were the most supportive of the Soviet system under         Stalin.  More recent interviews suggest that this pattern may have been         reversed.  Alternative Soviet sources for analyzing the                         intergenerational cleavages in political support manifested by groups           in the population are minimal.  This investigation should provide new           understanding of the political attitudes of significant dissident               elements in the USSR overtime by replicating the findings of the                Harvard project and reexamining the generational cleavages in political         support.",
