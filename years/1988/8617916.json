 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research deals with a study of the phenomena of                        structural relaxation in borate and silicate glasses.  The                      objective is to achieve a fundamental understanding of these                    processes in various model glass systems as employed in fiber                   forming operations.  The approach taken here is to employ both                  bulk analyses-thermal and optical properties, and analytical                    techniques which relate to the fine (electronic, atomic,                        molecular) structure of the material-nuclear magnetic resonance,                X-ray photoelectron, and Raman spectroscopy.  In addition, the                  data analysis will be conducted in reference to a                               theoretical model for structural relaxation in glasses, to                      provide a rational basis for the experimental work, and to                      provide the possibilities for improved theoretical modelling.                        This work is relevant both to the processing of bulk glass                 articles, as in the process of thermal tempering, or in the                     minimization of residual stresses through optimization of                       thermal history, and to the production of glass fibers for                      various purposes (as structural materials or optical waveguides),               where the combination of thermal history and structural                         relaxation during the drawing process are crucial to the                        structure and properties of the glass fibers.  In both cases, the               fundamental scientific understanding of structural relaxation                   processes is crucial to improvements in materials and products.",
