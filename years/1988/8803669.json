Continuation of the centroid-moment tensor (CMT) analysis                       of current events using GDSN, and other - as available -                        data, with the results sent to the USGS on a monthly                            basis and submitted quarterly for publication in the                            Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors.                                                                                                               2.  Utilization of the data from the High-Gain Long-Period                          (HGLP) network operating between 1972 and 1976; this was                        the first global digital network and little use has been                        made of it; will determine station responses and                                sensitivities; permanent storage on the optical media                           (WORM type discs);                                                                                                                                          3.  CMT and very broad bank (VBB) analysis of the HGLP data                         for selected events between 1972 and 1976; this period                          is characterized by many large earthquakes lacking, so                          far, proper analysis;                                                                                                                                       4.  Systematic search for events with a statistically                               significant non-double couple component; it is highly                           likely that there are events which have an unusual source                       mechanism: two events near Torishima Island, south of                           Japan and three events on Iceland have mechanism that                           appear to be consistent with being caused by magma                              injection.                                                              ***",
