 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a group of researchers at Syracuse                      University under the direction of Prof. J. Fendler to carry out                 collaborative research with a similar group at the Instituto                    National de Investigaciones Nucleares in Mexico City, Mexico, under             the direction of Prof L. A. Fucugauchi.  Over the past several                  years the collaborators have been successfully engaged in the                   preparation and characterization of micelles, microemulsions,                   liquid crystals, vesicles and polymerized vesicles.  All of these               molecular aggregates have a common theme in that they mimic the                 functions of a biological membrane.  For the proposed period of                 collaboration, the researchers intend to pursue the investigation               of membrane mimetics using nuclear techniques with the long range               goal of increasing our understanding of the chemistry of biological             membranes.                                                                                                                                                      The collaborators' work has been characterized by its productivity,             and mutual benefits.  Vesicles and polymerized vesicles have been               prepared in the United States while microemulsions and liquid                   crystals have been prepared and characterized in Mexico.  The                   structures and morphologies of the aggregates have been                         investigated by the U.S. group using static and dynamic light                   scattering and intrinsic and extrinsic spectroscopic methods.  The              Mexican group, on the other hand, has used polarized light                      microscopy for the characterization of liquid crystals and is                   experienced in the use of positron annihilation techniques to                   determine phase changes in the different systems.  The use of these             techniques has allowed the investigators to detect subtle and                   significant changes in surfactant morphologies.  Additionally, the              proposed research has a significant potential for application to                enhanced oil recovery, controlled drug release, catalysis, and the              control of various chemical processes.",
