 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1987, the National Academy of Engineering issued a report                    entitled \"Strengthening U.S. Engineering through International                  Cooperation.\"  The report emphasizes that technology in the                     United States tends to flow out of the country to scientists and                engineers abroad, but that few mechanisms exist to enhance the                  flow of technology from foreign countries to the U.S. engineering               community.                                                                                                                                                      The NAE report recommends that NSF, NAE, and other organizations                \"organize and fund lecture tours by distinguished foreign experts               to present reviews of, and perspectives on, their nations'                      developments in engineering and technology to U.S. universities                 and industry.\"  Oklahoma State University proposes to organize                  these lectures, but plans to bring the foreign experts to the                   television studios at OSU and televise the live lectures to                     universities and industry throughout the United States.  It is                  proposed that each lecture be approximately one to two hours in                 length followed by a telephone call-in question-and-answer period               of approximately one hour.                                                                                                                                      OSU is supported in this proposal by the National Technological                 University and its 200+ Ku-band receiving sites located in U.S.                 industry and government facilities.  Also, OSU proposes to                      advertise the lectures to some 600+ U.S. universities that                      presently have satellite receiving equipment and that regularly                 organize teleconference events.                                                                                                                                 The OSU proposes to organize and produce one briefing in Phase 1                and then continue with five additional briefings in Phase 2.  The               results of Phase 1 will be reviewed on the basis of technical                   merit; i.e., topic interest and importance, qualifications of the               speaker, and overall presentation.  A VHS cassette of the Phase 1               lecture will be used for evaluation by selected users.  Phase 2,                which provides for five additional briefings will be awarded                    based on obtaining satisfactory results from PHase 1 and the                    availability of funding to continue Phase 2.",
