 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project involves a multifaceted approach to                    investigate two fundamental questions:  1) the molecular                        determinants of antigenic recognition of peptides and                           proteins; and 2) the molecular basis for signal transduction                    by the G protein family.  Drs. Hamm and Kahn will study the                     conformation of an antigenic determinant of bovine guanine                      nucleotide binding protein (G-protein).  They have shown with                   monoclonal antibody 4A studies that this region is the major                    site of interaction with rhodopsin, the light receptor in                       vertebrate rods.  Thus, studies of the structure of this site                   will simultaneously provide information on the stucture of a                    receptor-effector recognition site, as well as the structure                    of an antigen-antibody interaction site.                                                                                                                           Despite the central position which peptides and proteins                     occupy in the regulation of virtually all biological                            processes, a molecular understanding of their structure-                        function relationship remains relatively unknown.  To date,                     extensive and in several cases successful efforts have been                     mounted to modify peptides and proteins to examine this                         interplay.  These studies will yield molecular models of the                    site of interaction of G-protein with rhodopsin, and may give                   insight into the recognition and triggering mechanisms                          involved in enzyme activation by protein-protein                                interactions.  The work will also shed light on the                             importance of secondary structure and rigidity/flexibility in                   antigen-antibody interactions.***",
