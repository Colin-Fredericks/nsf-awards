 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigation exploits a target of opportunity by                 providing partial support to defray funding of data collection in               France.  The research involves a collaborative study of                         presidential selection in France and the United States in the                   1988 elections in each country.  The investigators have gained                  the cooperation of SOFRES, the leading public opinion polling                   organization in France, for conducting a post-election French                   national sample survey.  The survey instrument to be employed in                France is based on the survey instruments that have been used in                U. S. National Election Studies in the past and that will be used               again in the November, 1988, election.                                                                                                                          The possibility of collaborating with the French presents an                    unprecedented opportunity due to the fact that it has been                      exceedingly difficult, in the past, to organize collaborative                   work with French scholars in political science.  The SOFRES group               will underwrite forty percent of the total costs associated with                the project and has agreed with the request made by the Principal               Investigators to make the data available to the larger scholarly                community.  The data will be made available publicly within one                 year of the completion of this project and will afford numerous                 scholars the opportunity to undertake independent analyses of it.",
