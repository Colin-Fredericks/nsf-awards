 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Second International Symposium on Hydrogenase will be                  held September 19th to the 23rd, 1988 at Unicoi, a conference                   Center in Northern Georgia.  The last formal conference was                     held in 1985 and substantial progress has been made in the                      ensued time.  The conference is being chaired by Dr. Leonard                    Mortenson.  The organizing committee is composed of Drs. Harry                  Peck, Mike Johnson and Jean LeGall, all at the University of                    Georgia.  Other than reporting the current status; a determined                 effort will be made to initiate ways to put together a data                     base of information.  A cross fertilization of ideas and joint                  experimentation will be encouraged.                                                  The enzyme, hydrogenase, is essential for the survival of                  anaerobic organisms since it couples the oxidation of key                       reduced electron carriers to the reduction of protons, and in                   turn the H  produced is used as an electron source by other                     organisms, such as the electron source for CO  and sulfate                      reductions by methanogens and sulfate reducing bacteria,                        respectively.  In many organisms the function of the                            hydrogenase is known but in other organisms the function is                     unclear.  It appears hydrogenase is required to use the H                       released during nitrogen fixation.  Hydrogenase also functions                  in a variety of procaryotes that are important in geochemical                   regulation.  It is an important enzyme and a meeting dedicated                  the elucidation of its role in nature is strongly recommended.                       These funds will be targeted for young investigators.",
