 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will help Dr. Robert A. Herendeen, Illinois Natural                  History Survey, to collaborate with Dr. Sven E. Jorgensen, Royal                Danish School of Pharmacy, Copenhagen, Denmark; Drs. AnnMari and                Bengt-Owe Jansson, University of Stockholm, Sweden; and                         Dr. Karl-Erik Eriksson, Chalmers University of Technology,                      Gothenburg, Sweden.  They will study coupled ecological-economic                systems.  One goal of the research is to examine the viability of               several principles for predicting dynamic ecosystem behavior under              changing energy availability and cropping.  The researchers will                test the degree to which physically-based and ecologically-based                analyses provide practical inputs into economic analysis and                    planning.                                                                                                                                                       The research will bring together scientists who hold differing views            of physical resource theory, and enable them to develop a mutually              acceptable framework for applying the theory and identifying data               and experiments for testing it.  Several ecosystem principles                   leading to different predictions will be tested.  The principles                refer to the maximizations of (1) energy, (2) ascendancy, (3) power,            and (4) net system output weighted by energy intensities.                       Dr. Herendeen has done research on principle (4).  Dr. Jorgensen is             the author of the maximization of energy principle and he and his               group are experienced researchers on perturbed ecological systems.              The Janssons have extensively investigated the Baltic ecosystem.                Dr. Ericksson's specialty is modeling physical ecological systems.              The proposed research will lead to further interpretation of the                system principles and to a coherent statement of their applicable               temporal, spatial, and organizational scales.",
