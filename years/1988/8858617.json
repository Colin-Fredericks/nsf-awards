 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates the regulation of plant gene                         expression.  It focuses on two regulatory genes of maize, c1                    and p1, which control the synthesis of anthocyanin pigments                     in the seed and in the plant, respectively.  Genetic and                        recently obtained molecular data indicate that these genes                      are functionally duplicate with distinct tissue specificity.                    Analysis of these two genes afford the opportunity to study                     two very basic features of plant gene expression:  1)  How do                   regulatory genes coordinately govern the expression of                          several biosynthetic genes in a given pathway?  and  2)  What                   is the basis for tissue-specific expression of functionally                     duplicate loci?%%%                                                                                                                                              The answers to these questions will not only contribute to                      the specific aim of understanding the regulation of                             anthocyanin synthesis, but should also apply to the long-term                   goal of solving problems of potential agronomic importance.                     Likewise, the results of experiments to understand specific                     regulatory interactions between the genes involved in                           anthocyanin synthesis are likely to provide an excellent                        basis for eventually unravelling the complex genetic                            interactions that govern quantitative traits of plants such                     as the components of yield.",
