 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award focuses on the processes of sedimentation of                 reduced sulfur compounds in the Black Sea, with particular                      emphasis on determining whether a significant flux of                           particulate reduced sulfur and iron compounds is occurring in                   the present-day anoxic water column.  This work is part of the                  1987 Black Sea Cruise.  The objectives are as follows:  1)                      Compare the relative sizes of the \"reservoirs\" of different                     particulate reduced-sulfur compounds such as pyrite, iron                       monosulfides, and elemental sulfur;  2)  Determine where                        different sulfur phases occur in the Black Sea--at the oxic-                    anoxic interface, in the anoxic water column, the sediment-                     water interface, and in bottom sediments;  3)  Compare spatial                  and temporal changes in sulfur and iron flux to such variation                  in other sedimentary flux components;  4)  Determine whether                    metal adsorption onto particles such as clays or cellular                       matter occurs, whether sulfides form on such particles in the                   anoxic zone, and whether their contribution to the flux is                      significant;  5)  Search for other trace metals or metal                        sulfides which may form in anoxic water.                                                This work will involve analyses of sediment trap material,              sediment cores, and suspended particulate matter from water                     samples, using techniques developed for determining the kinds                   and amounts of reduced sulfur and iron compounds present, as                    well as determining whether these are associated with fluxes of                 other particulate materials.  The results of this study will                    contribute to understanding the processes of metal sulfide                      formation, transport and sedimentation in anoxic environments.",
