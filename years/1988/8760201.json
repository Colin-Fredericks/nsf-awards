 "awd_abstract_narration": "A systematic study of a new family of high power switches is proposed.          This study is directed toward applying recently obtained results and            knowledge to the need for improved switches for lasers and other                applications, and toward improving the understanding of these new               switches.  The new switch is an optically triggered thyratron, also             referred to as a back of the cathode, light triggered thyratron (BLT).          Several versions are to be studied.  Improved switches are needed for           excimer lasers in the medum power range and above, pulsed electron              beams, and various types of accelerators.  This need is important               because a significant part of the performance limitation of these               devices, and hence the industrial applications, are caused by                   limitations imposed by the types of switches that are available.                Improved switches will lead to much more useful devices for industrial          applications.  The BLT operates cold cathode, does not arc, and has             improved characteristics over existing thyratrons in the areas that             are most important for these applications, including considerably               improved current rate of rise, peak current and reverse current                 handling capability.",
