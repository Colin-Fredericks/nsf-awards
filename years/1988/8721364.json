This project is a study of the mechanisms of                        heme-catalyzed oxidations. The reactions of various forms of                    oxygen, e.g., dioxygen, hydrogen peroxide, superoxide ion, and                  peracids,  with iron porphyrins in biological systems are                       fundamental to oxygen metabolism, drug detoxification, steroid                  biosynthesis, and removal of hydrogen perioxide from living                     systems.  Additionally, these metalloporphyrin systems                          constitute potentially important industrial oxidation                           catalysts.                                                                                                                                                      The model compounds under study are related to the hemin                        enzymes horseradish peroxidase, cytochrome peroxidase,                          catalase, chloroperoxidase, cytochrome P-450, and perhaps                       cytochrome oxidase.  The goal is to mimic the rapid,                            high-turnover catalytic reactions catalyzed by these enzymes                    and consequently to develop new catalyst systems for synthetic                  oxidations.  The project involves the design and preparation of                 new catalysts and the detailed studies of all of the steps                      involved in the metalloporphyrin-catalyzed epoxidation of                       alkenes, hydroxylation of alkanes, oxidations of arenes and                     phenols, and the decompositon of hydrogen peroxide and                          hydroperoxides.  Kinetics and mechanisms of the formation of                    intermediate high-valent states and of their reactions with                     substrates will be investigated.  In addition, the utilization                  of dioxygen in such reactions will be studied.",
