 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among the most important features of life histories are the             rates and schedules of births and deaths because they determine                 the \"success\" of organisms in their environment.  In, insects,                  these schedules are also affected by migration and diapause (the                insect analogue of hibernation).  Dr Dingle's research is                       especially concerned with how life histories, including migration               and diapause, are influenced by genes and the environment because               these factors act in concert to determine rate and direction of                 evolution.  The lesser migratory grasshopper is particularly                    interesting because it ranges widely both latitudinally and                     altitudinally.  By studying it over an altitudinal gradient from                sea level to 10,000 feet it will be possible to determine how                   natural selection has molded life histories over a wide range of                environments.  This grasshopper is also interesting because                     females determine whether or not their eggs diapause, and                       crowding produces dramatic changes in morphology and development                rates.  The latter, of course, influences the schedule of births                and so affects life histories.  Genetic and environmental                       influences on the interplay of all these factors are the focus of               this study.                                                                             This research also has significant applied aspects.                     Grasshoppers, including the lesser migratory grasshopper, are                   notorious outbreak species and periodically produce large                       populations which devastate crops over wide areas.  It is                       important to understand the genetics and ecology of grasshopper                 life histories in order to understand why outbreaks occur and to                predict where they will occur so that control measures can be                   instituted.",
