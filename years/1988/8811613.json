 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is concerned with the desalination of                     seawater on an industrial scale at low operating costs compared                 to conventional methods.  Methodology involves the fields of                    nuclear power, superconductivity, and reverse osmosis,                          Superconductors have the capability to generate extremely high                  magnetic fields at low cost.  The principles of nuclear reactors                are used to trap ions in a magnetic field away from the                         containing walls allowing the water to be desalinated to run                    directly through the center of the magnetic field.  After the                   seawater passes through the magnetic field the impurities are                   reduced by approximately one order of magnitude.  A modified                    reverse osmosis unit which operates on the centrifuge principle                 generates high pressure to desalt seawater form brackish water to               drinking water.  The separation phase provided by the high                      magnetic field brings the water to brackish water standards and                 reduces the high osmotic pressure barrier that needs to be                      overcome to desalinate seawater by reverse osmosis.                             All of the various aspects resulting from the above concepts will               be studied and a system will be suggested which will make                       possible a desalinization process that is efficient and                         inexpensive.",
