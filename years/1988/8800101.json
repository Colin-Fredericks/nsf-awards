 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies indicate that phytoplankton can be                          significantly enriched in 13C during bloom conditions.  This                    study seeks to confirm this association in shelf and slope waters               of the northern Middle Atlantic Bight and Gulf of Maine.  High                  precision carbon isotope ratio measurements will be done on                     preserved samples from quarterly cruises as well as on laboratory               phytoplankton cultures and extracted chlorophyllide a from live                 phytoplankton.  In addition to these primary objectives, initial                studies of the utility of the nitrogen and carbon isotopic                      signatures in analyzing food web structure will be made.                        Isotopic analysis of selected higher trophic level organisms will               be made for this purpose.                                                            An element may exist in more than one atomic weight, and                   these various forms are called isotopes of that element.                        Although chemically similar, the ratios among the elemental                     isotopes vary among pools because of fractionation processes                    associated with chemical and physical transformations.  Isotopic                signatures have long been used in other areas of earth science,                 and  this study attempts to extend this usefulness into marine                  ecology.  This study examines the hypothesis that variations in                 productivity are associated with isotopic variations.  This is an               exciting prospect, in that such a relationship would serve as a                 useful adjunct to (or even replacement for) current tracer                      techniques of measuring productivity, as well as serve as a                     tracer for marine food web studies.  The study consists of both                 laboratory work and field sampling in Georges Bank, a productive                fishing ground off the U. S. New England coast.",
