 "awd_abstract_narration": "Orientation and migration are essential components of most                      animals' life-history patterns, permitting them to find and                     exploit favorable environmental conditions, locate and capture                  prey, and engage in reproductive and other social activities.                   An individual's ability to produce precisely timed movements                    coordinated with peak environmental and social conditions must                  depend heavily on its capacity to process and respond to relevant               sensory information from both its internal and external                         environment.                                                                                                                                                    Dr. Sydlik will examine the role of local environmental factors                 in the migratory movements of horseshoe crabs.  These animals are               ideal for such a study because (1) major environmental factors                  (lunar and tidal cycles, time of day) that influence the timing                 of their migrations are known, (2) large numbers of animals                     migrate repeatedly over short distances, ensuring availability                  for study, (3) we have extensive knowledge of their sensory                     systems, and (4) Dr. Sydlik's preliminary work indicates that                   ultrasonic tracking can be used to collect precise data on the                  timing and paths taken into and away from shore during migration.                                                                                               Data from ultrasonic and environmental transmitters carried by                  the animals, and from a submerged stand-alone environmental-                    monitoring unit, will be collected and processed by computers                   housed in a van located near the shore.  Using these data, Dr.                  Sydlik will evaluate the influences of water depth, surge                       direction, salinity, temperature, pressure, and flow rate over                  the animals' shells in stimulating and directing the migratory                  behavior of these long-lived marine invertebrates.",
