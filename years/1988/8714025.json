 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object of this research is a systematic evaluation of sources           and sinks of turbulent kinetic energy in the atmospheric surface                layer.  Effects of stability on the normalized terms of the turbulent           energy equation (the so-called \"phi functions\") are being                       investigated in a graduated series of comparatively small field                 experiments.  The particular forms of and the empirical constants in            relations for these functions now commonly used to parameterize the             lower boundary layer remain uncertain because of contradictory                  results of subsequent experiments and incomplete investigation of the           effects of stability.                                                               This experiment will measure wind profiles, turbulence spectra,             surface thermal energy balances, and Bowen ratios in order to                   evaluate the effects of moderate departures from neutrality upon (1)            the rates at which turbulence is produced by wind shear and buoyancy,           (2) the turbulence dissipation rate, (3) the net rate at which energy           is locally gained or lost by the sum of the divergence terms.  To               obtain this budget data, additional measurements will be added: the             depth of the mixed layer will be monitored acoustically and the                 vertical turbulent flux of turbulent energy will be measured by two             levels by eddy correlation.  All field experiments will be conducted            over extensive cropped surfaces of uniform roughness.                               Professor Frenzen is well qualified to make these measurements;             he has considerable experience in previous field measurements                   especially in the use of his unique low-inertia anemometers.",
