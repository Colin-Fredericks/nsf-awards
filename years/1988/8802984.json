 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intersecting optical waveguides are an essential element for                    integrated optic devices.  Previous applications have been limited              because of the absence of a rigorous theory for this geometry.                  Such a theory has already been developed by the P.I. and                        subsequently predicted several unexpected optical characteristics.              Also predictions were confirmed experimentally.  Theoretical analysis           will be extended to examine new optical waveguide devices based on              intersecting waveguides and incorporating the electro-optic and                 higher order nonlinear effects.                                                                                                                                 Electro-optic devices will include high density switch arrays, tunable          wavelength filters, and discrete spectrum analyzers.  The analysis              will be followed by design and fabrication of these devices in                  LiNbo3.  Theory of intersecting guides to treat the case of an                  optically nonlinear substrate will also be extended.  Incorporation of          the intersecting waveguide structure into a medium with (reasonable)            third order nonlinearity intended.                                                                                                                              The guided mode and radiation mode coupling results will be                     integrated into a single coupled-mode theory.  This will permit                 simultaneously accounting for radiation loss and interwaveguide                 coupling in the analysis and design of                                          intersecting waveguide devices.",
