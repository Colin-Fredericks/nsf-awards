 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Information Sciences Institute (ISI) of the University of                 Southern California using its extensive experience with computer                communication protocols and software, propose to continue their                 efforts in aiding the foundation's efforts to provide a reliable                and robust research network for scientists and engineers, NSFNET.                 ISI proposes to do work in two areas:                                         The first area is protocol engineering.  The particular                         requirements of the NSFnet user community as well as the general                need to resolve outstanding difficulties in the Internet                        architecture will require the design, testing, and                              standardization of new protocols, modifications to existing                     protocols, and further documentation and clarification of the                   underlying Internet architecture.  Examples of protocols which                  need protocol engineering work for NSFnet include: routing                      protocols, gateway monitoring protocols, network file protocols,                transaction protocols, and remote job entry protocols.  Within                  budgetary limitations, ISI proposes to perform protocols                        engineering in the first two of these areas.  In addition, ISI                  proposes to continue documentation and standardization of                       protocols and architecture.                                                       The second area encompasses technical planning and coordination               activities which are directly relevant to NSFnet development.                   These activities include participation on key technical planning                bodies for NSFnet and for the general Internet, as well as direct               advice to NSF.",
