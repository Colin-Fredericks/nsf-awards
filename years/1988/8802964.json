 "awd_abstract_narration": "City College - CUNY proposes the establishment of a Center for the              Analysis of Structures and Interfaces.  Investigators at the Center             will study the optical spectroscopy of semiconductors and adsorbates            and the time-dependent analysis of interactive phenomena between                surfaces.  Results from these studies will impact surface and                   materials science, solar cell development, photocatalytic systems, and          optoelectronics.  In addition, the Center will develop strategies to            strengthen partnerships with industry and other major research                  institutions and help motivate minority students to consider careers            in science and engineering.                                                                                                                                     This project meets the major goal of the Minority Research Centers of           Excellence (MRCE) program:  to increase the minority presence in                science and engineering by making substantial resources available to            upgrade the research capabilities of the most research productive               minority institutions.  The project will at the same time enable this           institution to use research as a tool to increase the effectiveness of          related science and engineering activities for minority groups in its           region.  The Center will accomplish this primarily by providing                 opportunities for faculty and students at City College and assisting            other nearby institutions with sizable minority student enrollments to          engage in meritorious research that leads to publications in refereed           journals.",
