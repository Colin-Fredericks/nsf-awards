Members of the delegation were selected from researchers                 who had submitted abstracts of papers which were selected for                   publication and presentation.  All of the delegation members are also           members of the NSF-funded \"U.S. Coordinated Program for Masonry                 Building Research (TCCMAR).  Attendance at the conference                       permitted researchers to participate in an international forum for              the exchange of masonry information.  The delegation was exposed                to researchers from all parts of the world and their work and                   correspondingly, made researchers elsewhere aware of U.S. research              and progress in masonry materials and structures.  Attendance at the            Conference facilitated establishing communication and dialogue                  between U.S. researchers and those elsewhere.",
