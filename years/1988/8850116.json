 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of North Carolina Mathematics and Science Education              Network (MSEN), 1988 Summer Scholars Programs will be a major component         of MSEN's Pre-College Program in mathematics and science for                    historically underrepresented students.  The MSEN Pre-College Program           is an academic enrichment program that has its goal graduating minority         and female students from high school with sufficient interest and               preparation in mathematics, science and English to pursue math or               science based fields at the university level.                                                                                                                   Summer Scholars Program activities will be offered to 320 junior and            senior high (grades 7-12) minority and female students at four campuses         within the statewide UNC System.                                                                                                                                The Summer Scholars Program is an integral component of the MSEN Pre-           College Program through which participating students receive intense,           experiential earning activities in mathematics, science and                     communications through small group and individual interaction.  The             Summer Scholars Program involves parents, teachers, and business and            university scientists and engineers in the students development.                                                                                                Each Summer Scholars Program consists of four courses that meet daily           for one hour--mathematics, science projects, communications, and                instrumental enrichment--as well as field trips, meetings with                  university and business scientists, and program involving parents.  The         courses are academically intensive, challenging and enriching                   supplements to regular school-year courses.  These courses enable               students to improve and refine their knowledge and skills with                  individual and group instruction from teachers, participation in                laboratory and field work, interaction with business and university             scientists and engineers, and through team approaches to learning.",
