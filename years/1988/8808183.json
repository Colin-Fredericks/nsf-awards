 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of inductively coupled plasma (ICP)               spectroscopy.  The thrust of this experimental project continues                studies initiated under NSF grant CHE-8503090 that focus on sample              introduction for inductively coupled plasma atomic emission                     spectroscopy (ICP/AES) and inductively coupled plasma mass                      spectrometry (ICP/MS).  A number of physical parameters which                   describe aerosol generation, transport, evaporation, and                        interactions with the plasma will be measured.  These parameters                include drop size distributions of aerosols, and mass transport                 values for analyte and solvent transport to the plasma.  A key                  aspect of the work is an investigation of the mechanisms of                     solvent liquid and vapor interaction with the plasma, which appear              to exert a major effect on important plasma properties, such as                 ionization temperature and electron density.  As part of this                   research, a working model of aerosol generation, using pneumatic                and other means of nebulization will be developed, based on                     experimental data obtained by laser Fraunhofer scattering.  The                 use of a monodisperse aerosol generator (MAGIC) interface as a                  means of introducing desolvated analyte to both atmospheric                     pressure and low pressure radio frequency discharges will be                    investigated, and the fundamental aerodynamic, particle dynamic,                and transport aspects of these interfaces will be studied.  The                 low pressure interface will be coupled to a novel low-pressure ICP              for use in both ICP/AES and ICP/MS.                                                                                                                             This research, which focusses on the historically weak link                     (sample introduction) in ICP-based analyses, opens the door to                  broader applications of analytically powerful ICP spectroscopic                 techniques and should enable the development of new technologies                which could be capitalized upon by private sector instrument                    manufacturers.",
