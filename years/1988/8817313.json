 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Iowa State University will fund the purchase of              small equipment items necessary for the effective participation of              Drs. Lee and Wendel in a collaborative research project with David              Hoisington and Ed Coe at the University of Missouri (NSF 8721921).              The project will continue and expand collaborative research aimed               at producing an integrated physical and genetic map of maize.                   Genetic mapping strategies of several types will be used to                     identify and correlate the positions of RFLP markers, cytological               markers (knobs, deletions, insertions and inversions), biochemical              markers (mutations responsible for isozymes) and other,                         conventional markers.  Although a substantial amount of positional              information for these various types of markers is now available,                relatively little has been done to correlate the map of                         cytological markers with that of the biochemical ones, the RFLP                 map with the cytological map and so on.  Particular focus is                    placed on the newly developed technique of RFLP mapping because                 the map is not yet complete, and because no single lab has yet                  assembled a complete set of RFLP marker DNAs that are available to              all researchers.  Although the research will be performed                       principally by Drs, Coe and Hoisington, collaboration with other                corn geneticists, especially those skilled in the identification                of biochemical markers, is required.  Thus, small concurrent                    awards are being made to these investigators at Iowa State, as                  well as others at Illinois State University and North Carolina                  State.  These awards will provide laboratory equipment that will                facilitate analysis and comparison of data developed in the                     separate labs and will insure that research materials developed by              each investigator will be readily accessible to all the                         collaborators.                                                                       Traditionally, techniques for genetic mapping have been a                  useful tool for researchers interested in a variety of basic                    questions in biology as well as for plant and animal breeders.                  The recent development of a powerful new technique called RFLP                  mapping will have a significant effect on the ease with which                   genetics can be brought to bear on both basic and applied                       problems.  However, it is important that the knowledge and tools                of the more traditional techniques be preserved and that they be                integrated (or correlated) with the new RFLP maps.  This is                     particularly true in the case of corn, which has been the subject               of extensive genetic study.  The proposed collaborative research                will accelerate the development of a complete RFLP map of corn and              will insure that the map is a tool available to all researchers                 and agronomists.  Moreover, by facilitating the integration of the              RFLP data with that obtained with other types of genetic markers,               the research will insure that the RFLP map is of maximum utility                for those who need it.",
