 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of photoelectrochemistry.  This                   research activity continues and broadens investigations of                      electrochemical and photoelectrochemical reactions and the                      characterization of semiconductor electrodes that were initiated                during the tenure of NSF grant CHE-8304666.  This research is                   providing fundamental insights into the nature of the                           semiconductor/liquid junction and the chemical and photochemical                reactions that can be carried out at such junctions.  These                     interfacial systems are of direct significance to applications                  such as solar energy conversion to electricity and useful chemical              products, photoetching of semiconductors, analytical sensors, and               nonlinear optical devices.  This research stresses new approaches               to the characterization of the semiconductor interface by scanning              tunneling microscopy and ellipsometry, and the study of size and                doping effects in particulate semiconductors.  Investigations of                the design and application of \"integrated chemical systems\" having              tailored arrangements of semiconductor, catalyst, sensitizer, and               redox couples within a support, with structural organization at                 the micrometer level, to promote desired photoreactions will be                 pursued.                                                                                                                                                        This broad research activity provides new, fundamental knowledge                of photoinduced charge transfer processes at semiconductor                      interfaces and the effects of structure and ordered chemical                    composition on the efficiency of these processes.  Additionally,                these studies should give rise to new photoelectrochemical devices              and enhanced technologies for the processing of semiconductor                   materials.",
