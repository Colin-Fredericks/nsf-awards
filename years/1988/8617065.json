 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between                          Professors James L. White and Mukerrem Cakmak, University                       of Akron, and Professor Hans G. Zachmann, University of                         Hamburg, Federal Republic of Germany.  They will study                          semicrystalline polymers undergoing stress-induced                              crystallization.  They will examine the phase transitions                       and the reasons for the transitions in various thermotropic                     liquid crystal polymers.  Their materials will be carefully                     chosen blends of polymers that are either miscible or                           immiscible with each other.  One reason for selecting the                       particular materials is their potential commercial                              importance.                                                                                                                                                     The primary purpose of the research is to learn about the                       fundamental structures of the liquid crystalline polymers                       and their blends and the sources and actions of the phase                       transitions of these materials.  The U.S. researchers will                      prepare the test materials and study them during                                melt-spinning to obtain preliminary optical and thermal                         measurements.  In Germany, the researchers will use the                         HASYLAB synchrotron as an x-ray source for small-angle                          scattering measurements.  The project will benefit from the                     competence of the investigators and their history of                            successful collaborations.  Professors White and Cakmak are                     experts in polymer engineering and Professor Zachmann is a                      highly regarded polymer physicist.",
