 "awd_abstract_narration": "New methods for light microscopy will be developed.  The focus                  will be on the digital imaging microscope, which can be used for                the analysis of changes in molecular distribution underlying cell               function.  The spatial and temporal resolution of current camera                and microscope systems will be improved by developing both new                  camera recording systems and a new high speed confocal                          microscope.  Further improvements in image quality will be sought               by the development of image restoration methods that incorporate                a priori information about the biology to enhance the reversal of               distortion and noise introduced by the imaging process.  In order               to facilitate subsequent interactive analysis, work will be                     carried out to develop image feature extraction systems capable                 of recognizing regular sub-cellular features of interest so that                images may be simplified and principle features of interest                     presented for subsequent analysis.  Finally, work will be carried               out to develop interactive 3-D graphics display systems allowing                the biologist to extract information in a quantitative yet                      flexible manner form such images.  These projects will be carried               out by a team consisting of biologists, computer scientists,                    mathematicians and physicists.                                                                                                                                  The research is motivated by the need to better understand how                  molecular distribution in cells and tissues determines their                    function.  While the development of tools address these issues                  will require the solution of problems that are physical and                     mathematical in nature, the ultimate benefit from these efforts                 will be in the area of biological research.  The method will have               an important impact on cell biology and neurobiology and                        ultimately on biomedical research as well.",
