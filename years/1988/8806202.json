First,the properties of a range of standard and less common                     patterndescriptors will be explored theoretically, through                      computersimulations of a general model and a number of more                     specializedmodels.  The descriptors to be used include                          semivariance,spectral analysis and fractals.  Next, the                         descriptors will beapplied to a well\u001a.\u001adeveloped data set for the               serpentine grass\u001a.\u001aland at Jasper Ridge, California.  The goal in               this case is thedevelopment of models that can describe                         vegetation pattern atJasper Ridge and other                                     disturbance\u001a.\u001ainfluenced sites.  Finally,the models will be tested              for tree communities of Barro ColoradoIsland, Panama, an                        experimental field in central Illinois, andthe Duke Forest.                                                                                                     The long\u001a.\u001aterm goal for these pattern analysis exercises is                    toimprove our ability to interpret landscape patterns and                       theircauses.  Ultimately, it will be important to explore the                   effectsof biotic patterning on ecosystem processes                              includingbiogeochemical cycling.                                                                                                                                Dr. Levin is a leader in the field of pattern analysis inecology.               The cooperation between Levin and Dr. Mooney, andempiricist in                  charge of the Jasper Ridge project, must beconsidered a strong                  point of this proposal.
