 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of transition metals exchanged into zeolites                    or into silicon-containing aluminophosphate molecular sieves                    (SAPOs) as catalysts for redox reactions.  The zeolites                         studied include silicon-enriched faujasites and other                           large-pore zeolites such as zeolite L and zeolite omega.  The                   kinetics of reactions such as the reduction of nitric oxide                     with carbon monoxide or ammonia, the decomposition of nitrous                   oxide, and the partial oxidation of methane are examined.                       Emphasis is placed on how the coordination environments of                      the transition-metal cations in these materials are related                     to their catalytic behavior.  Kinetic measurements are                          combined with studies involving isotopic tracers, and these                     findings are coupled with spectroscopic and calorimetric                        studies of the interactions of the cations with various                         adsorbate molecules.  A goal is to determine the sitings of                     exchanged cations and the natures of their interactions with                    the zeolite (or SAPO) matrix, adsorbed gases, and other                         coexchanged metal cations.  Spectroscopic techniques used                       include high-field magic-angle nuclear magnetic resonance,                      infrared spectroscopy (both midrange and far range), and                        Moessbauer spectroscopy.                                                                                                                                        The issues being addressed are of considerable fundamental                      importance.  In addition the systems under investigation may have               direct application in partial oxidation in a variety of                         industrial settings, fixation of                                                methane, automotive emission control, and acid rain amelioration.                                                                                               This is a collaborative effort between the Milwaukee and Madison                campuses of the University of Wisconsin.",
