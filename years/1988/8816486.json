To accomplish this objective, the plan is to           analyze experiences that have resulted in both successful and as yet            unsuccessful applications to determine whether there are consistent             patterns for the current status regarding adoption or application.                                                                                              This project is part of the educational program conducted by the                Worcester Polytechnic Institute through its Washington, D.C. Project            Center.  Results of this project are expected to be applied to                  improving the process by which results of research are made                     available to practicing environmental engineers.",
