 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information is essential to decisionmaking in all aspects of                    life, whether in making a simple decision concerning the                        purchase of a common household item or in making one that is                    far more complex and important, such as choosing options when                   confronted with a choice which may mean life or death.  It is                   important to assess whether the decisionmaking process can be                   improved by a legislative approach.  Ms. Caroline Bagley's                      doctoral dissertation research examines the impact of mandatory                 specific breast cancer disclosure legislation on physician                      practices to women newly diagnosed with breast cancer.  Under                   the direction of Dr. Horn, she plans to determine if there is a                 difference in the pattern of physician disclosure concerning                    treatment options for breast cancer in a state that has passed                  legislation on physician disclosure when compared to one that                   has not.  Specifically, Ms. Bagley focuses on a survey of                       surgeons in Michigan, a state with the legislation, and in                      Indiana, a state without the legislation, in order to assess                    whether requiring by law that certain standardized information                  sources be available for women diagnosed with breast cancer is                  having the intended effect on improving the health care                         decisionmaking process.  This project holds substantial promise                 of advancing our understanding of the impact of the law and the                 efficacy of the legislative approach to disclosure.",
