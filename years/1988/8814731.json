 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project provides for participation by 20                     U.S. scientists in an Indo-U.S. workshop on Bayesian analysis                   in statistics and econometrics to be held at the Indian                         Statistical Institute (ISI), Bangalore, India between December                  19 and 23, 1988.  The U.S. organizer is Dr. Prem Goel of Ohio                   State University, and the Indian co-organizer is Dr. N.S.                       Iyengar, head of the economic analysis unit at ISI, and                         president of the Indian Econometric Society.  Topics to be                      covered are:  Econometric modeling and forecasting; Bayesian                    computing; Reliability and process control; Foundation and                      decision theory; Hierarchical models and robust Bayes                           analysis; and Bayes and empirical Bayes inferences.  The                        proceedings are expected to be published.                                                                                                                       Scope:  Indian statisticians have been very active in India,                    and many Indians who work in the U.S. have contributed greatly                  to the field.  The proposed workshop is to impart the                           relatively new Bayesian approach to statistics and decision                     analysis, to the Indian Community of young statisticians who                    mostly emphasize the classic approach to the same problems.                     This interaction is likely to make a large impact on the                        future research in statistics in general and in its                             applications to India, by stimulating interest in this modern                   aspect of statistics research and in modernization of                           statistical education.",
