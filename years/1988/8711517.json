 "awd_abstract_narration": "Telomeres, specialized structures at chromosome ends, are                    essential to maintain chromosome stability.  Broken                             chromosomes are unstable, but may become \"healed\" by                            recombination with an intact homologue, or by more novel                        means to produce terminally deficient chromosomes.  These may                   arise either by de novo telomere formation or by                                translocations.  A detailed analysis of chromosome repair                       will be carried out in the yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae,                      using several methods to introduce chromosome breaksat one                      chromosomal location.  Strains containing de novo telemeres                     will be analyzed to determine the molecular mechaniswm by                       which these ends are added to broken chromosomes.                               Translocations will be monitored by an improved method of                       detection.  We have discovered a novel form of repair of                        broken chromosomes, by recombination between homologous                         regions well-separated from, but flanking the break-point.                      This intra-chromosomal repair system will be analyzed in                        detail, to determine how far homologous sites can be                            separated and how much homology is required.  This event can                    be induced synchronously and followed in \"real time\" by DNA                     analysis.  Special emphasis will be given to understanding                      the mechanism by which broken chromosomes become shorter.                       The structure of normal telomeres will also be examined to                      determine the origin of a high degree of polymorphism and                       rearrangement in the regions immediately adjacent to                            telomeres.  Finally, we will extend our study of the repair                     of broken chromosomes to another, evolutionarily divergent                      yeast, Schizosaccharomyces cerevisiae.  Linear dicentric                        chromosomes will be generated by meiotic recombination                          between a linear chromosome and a circular chromosome                           constructed by recombinant DNA techniques.  The differences                     in chromosome structure and DNA repair mechanisms between S.                    pombe and S. cerevisiae are expected to reveal different                        types of healing events.                                                           Little is known of chromosome structure and how it is                        maintained.  The stability of chromosomes which allows                          faithful segregation must be inherent in the structure and                      this work will provide insight into that structure.",
