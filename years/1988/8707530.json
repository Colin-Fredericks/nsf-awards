 "awd_abstract_narration": "The extracellular matrix has long been recognized as a scaffold                 for developing and regenerating tissues.  Recently the matrix has               been shown to have more specific effects on cellular                            differentiation.  In the case of regenerating muscle, studies                   demonstrate that molecules associated with the synaptic portion                 of the matrix direct the accumulation of specific components on                 myofibers and nerve terminals.  Although the functional                         components of nerve and muscle have been identified, little is                  known about how they are brought together into the orderly                      arrangement necessary for synaptic transmission.                                                                                                                Dr. Nitkin will examine the role of extracellular matrix factors                in the development of synaptic structure at the neuromuscular                   junction.  During regeneration, factors associated with the                     matrix direct the differentiation of both pre- and postsynaptic                 elements.  Dr. Nitkin and his colleagues will focus on agrin, a                 matrix molecule that induces discrete synapse-like patches on                   myotubes grown in culture.  They will use cellular and molecular                approaches in culture to examine the following aspects of synapse               formation:  (1) What is the biochemical nature of the active                    molecule?  (2) How is agrin integrated into the extracellular                   matrix at the neuromuscular junction?  (3) How does agrin                       interact with myotubes to bring about synaptic differentiation?                                                                                                 The results of these experiments will increase our understanding                of the mechanisms of synapric organization, and may eventually                  contribute to the design of clinical strategies for facilitating                regeneration of nervous tissue.",
