 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is to analyze the 2000-3000 km scale geoid                  anomalies and the corresponding sea floor topography in the                     central Pacific to determine their source and determine the mode                of convective motions in the mantle. The essence of the problem                 is how to get temperature anomalies to shallow depths in the                    mantle.  The PI proposes to address this question by two-                       dimensional finite difference numerical modeling of high Rayleigh               number, infinite Prandtl number Boussinesq fluid convection with                temperature and pressure dependent viscosity.                                   %%%                                                                                     One of the fundamental problems in earth sciences today is              to understand how motion of the earth's mantle occurs and how                   that motion can be deduced from an examination of things we can                 observe at the earth's surface.  Seafloor bathymetry and the                    earth's gravity field are observables that are related to mantle                motions.  In this work models of a variety of types of mantle                   motions will be developed and their gravity and bathymetric                     signals calculated and the results compared to anomalous features               of the observed field.  These calculations should help deduce                   which classes of mantle motions are most probable.",
