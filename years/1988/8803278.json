 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several hardware description mechanisms for digital circuits will be            investigated, with the goals of obtaining a better theoretical                  understanding of the comparative advantages and disadvantages of                alternate mechanisms, formalizing new models where appropriate,                 developing efficient algorithms where possible, and revealing                   computational difficulty where present.  Issues to be studied include           how expressive power and the computational complexity of analysis and           synthesis problems are affected by varying the model of a given                 description mechanism, or imposing restrictions on its features.                                                                                                Hierarchical, recursive, and algebraic descriptions will be                     investigated, and descriptions at varying levels of abstraction will be         considered.  Definitional and computational issues arising from the             specification and computation of attributes associated with the                 exploded tree corresponding to a hierarchical circuit description will          be explored. Alternate methods of describing combinational logic, their         relative economy of description, their inter-translatability, and their         suitability for automatic circuit synthesis and test generation, will           be studied.                                                                                                                                                     Also to be investigated are issues involved in the use of massively             parallel computers, particularly in uses pertaining to hardware                 analysis. Possible algorithmic factors posed by these machines are the          effects of the interconnection network topology, and computation in a           single instruction stream, multiple data stream mode.",
