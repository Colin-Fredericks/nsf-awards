 "awd_abstract_narration": "With previous NSF funding and support from IBM, an electronic                   network, PSI-NET, has been established which links all state                    science supervisors, and is accessible by the NSF, NSTA, and                    other organizations concerned with school science education.                    This system will now be extended to science teachers in six                     states to test the technical feasibility and the utility of                     this further networking through a single system.  IBM will                      continue to support the development of the system                               technically.  A committee of state science supervisors will                     guide and evaluate the use of the system in the six trial                       states to provide a basis for decisions on the desireability                    of ultimate extension to science teachers in all states.                        Introduction of state mathematics supervisors onto PSI-NET                      will also be initiated to evaluate the utility of this                          additional extension.                                                                                                                                           Cost sharing by the partners will total 159% of the NSF                         funding.",
