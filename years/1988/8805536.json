 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            designed to increase the participation of minorities in scientific and          engineering research.  The program provides support to strengthen the           research environments and capabilities of institutions that have                substantial minority student enrollments.  Eligible institutions must           also have graduate programs in science or programs in engineering.              The principal investigator at North Carolina Central University will            use RIMI support to study geophysical and manmade hazards and how               geographic information systems (GIS) may be utilized to determine the           causes, consequences, prevention, and mitigation of such                        disturbances.  Investigators will analyze rainfall patterns,                    flucitations in surface temperatures, flooding, and factors that                affect ground water chemistry.  In addition, studies will examine the           indirect social and economic effects of hazards and what mechanisms             may be used by humans to cope when these events occur.                                                                                                          This project will help address the research goal of an urban                    institution that is attempting to build its research and education              base in the sciences.  The principal investigator is a well-trained             geographer who publishes regularly in refereed journals.  Minority              faculty and students will have their research capabilities                      strengthened by their performance of meritorious research using GIS             and modern instrumentation.",
