Everything from a large number of automatic teller              machines, bank and brokerages to aircraft trying to land at O'Hare              International Airport were affected.                                                                                                                            The objective of this research is to track all of the losses and                attendant costs that resulted from this single structure loss                   situation.  Losses in terms of revenue, jobs, increased costs of fire           and police et cetera, will be tracked through the system in order to            develop an understanding of the importance of these types of                    situations to the nation and to the individual suppliers of goods and           services.  The model created can then be considered for introduction            to earthquake, wind and flood economic loss models.",
