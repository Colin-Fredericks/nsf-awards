 "awd_abstract_narration": "The physics of lithospheric deformation is primarily a                     continuum problem relating stress and strain through rheological                properties.  Progress towards understanding physical processes                  involves laboratory experiments that directly measure rheological               properties in earth materials, and through well-posed natural                   experiments of lithospheric deformation.  This project is aimed at              determining the response of the lithosphere to extreme tectonic                 unloading in an extensional environment.  A potential study area                is located along the western margin of the Colorado Plateau in the              Virgin Mountains, where large-scale mid-Miocene extensional                     tectonism along down-to-the-west normal faults has transported                  crustal fragments originally adjacent to the plateau 50-100 km to               the west.  In the wake of these transported fragments the                       extensional \"breakaway zone\" at the edge of the plateau                         experienced at least 5 and possibly as much as 20 km of uplift.                 This proposal will examine the Gold Butte block in detail, by                   structural mapping and laboratory fluid inclusion studies, to                   determine the degree of internal disruption and the amount of                   differential uplift and erosion across the rotated block.  Results              will bear directly on the appropriateness of this area determining              the role of isostatic uplift in continental extension, and also on              extensional response of the lithosphere generally.",
