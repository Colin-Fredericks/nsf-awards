The                  activation of hydrocarbons is of great importance in the                        chemical and pharmaceutical industries, since hydrocarbons are                  the ultimate starting materials for the synthesis of most                       organic compounds.                                                                                                                                              The overall objective of the research is to explore and develop                 the chemistry of highly reduced complexes of the early                          transition metals with aromatic ligands, particularly their                     potential as intermediates in a novel sequence for                              electrophilic arene substitution under mild conditions. These                   experiments build on the recent observation that electrophiles                  such as benzyl chloride or the hydrogen ion add readily to the                  eta-4-complex of benzenechromiumtricarbonyl, giving                             cyclohexadienyl complexes analogous to those prepared by                        nucleophilic addition to this chromium compound. Specific                       objectives of the project include 1) establishing the                           mechanistic details of the oxidative addition of benzyl                         chloride to the eta-4-benzenechromiumtricarbonyl dianion, 2)                    exploring the range of electrophilic functional groups which                    will add to the activated arenes in                                             eta-4-arenechromiumtricarbonyl dianion complexes, and 3)                        determining the range and regioselectivity of reductive                         activation/electrophilic addition procedures with                               chromiumtricarbonyl complexes of a variety of substituted                       arenes. The possibility of reductive activation sequences with                  arenes coordinated to other metal/ligand templates will also be                 examined, as will the feasibliity of reductive activation of                    cyclopentadienyl ligands. Napthalenide reduction will be used                   also as a route to substituted carbonylmetalates of early                       transition metals with cyclopentadienyl and pi-heterocycle                      ligands.",
