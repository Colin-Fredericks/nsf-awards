 "awd_abstract_narration": "Faculty adviser Dr. Beryl Simpson and graduate student Jan                 Saunders will study the tropical tree genus Waltheria and related               species, using herbarium specimens and new field collections made               in Brazil.  Because the genus is poorly known, work will focus on               improved species descriptions, maps of geographic distribution,                 identification keys, and inferences about evolutionary                          relationships of the estimated 50 species, 25 of which occur in                 Brazil.  The resultant taxonomic monograph will also resolve the                nomenclature of the 120 scientific names currently applied to                   these plants worldwide.  In addition, the unusual breeding system               of distyly (two floral forms, on separate plants) will be                       studied.  Pin plants bear flowers with long styles and short                    stamens, whereas thrum plants bear flowers with short styles and                long stamens.  The floral dimorphism typically is linked by a                   supergene to a diallelic sporophytic incompatibility system which               reduces the amount of inbreeding that can occur within a plant                  population.  In this study, the morphological differences between               pin and thrum forms in several species will be analyzed                         extensively, especially the pollen.  Possible stages in the                     evolution of distyly will also be studied, in the course of                     comparative analyses of Waltheria and related genera of the                     Sterculiaceae family.",
