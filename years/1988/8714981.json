 "awd_abstract_narration": "Strong correlations exist between secondary mechanical                          relaxations in glassy polymers and their mechanical properties.                 Previous dynamic mechanical studies have not yielded precise                    information on the nature and origin of the mechanical                          relaxations.  Advanced NMR techniques have provided detailed                    information on certain molecular motions, but these motions are                 not necessarily representative of those detected by DMS.                        Molecular motions most directly relatable to mechanical                         deformations are likely to be highly cooperative.  Cooperative                  molecular motions in copolymers of polycarbonates will be studed                by systematically varying sequences of mobile and less mobile                   repeat units.  The in-chain correlation distance will be                        determined using dynamic-mechanical measurements.  By measuring                 dynamic bulk relaxation, one can assess the extent of                           intermolecular interaction associated with these cooperative                    motions.  By measuring the yield stress and post yield cold                     drawing dependence on temperature and strain rate, one can                      establish correlations between molecular architecture, molecular                cooperativity, and mechanical properties.                                                                                                                       This research could ultimately lead to polymers with                            improved mechanical properties by relating those propertes with                 the structure of the polymers and their molecular motions.",
