 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides for the participation of David Hofmann of the               University of Wyoming in the third National Ozone Expedition                    (NOZE-3).  He will make balloon borne measurements of ozone,                    temperature, humidity and aerosol profiles from McMurdo,                        Antarctica during the late winter and early spring.  Hofmann's                  previous work has lent much insight into the development and                    causes of the annual springtime depletion of ozone over                         Antarctica.                                                                                                                                                     Balloons will be flown from August, throughout September and into               October.  A variety of payloads will be flown that will provide                 not only ozone profiles, but aerosol size distributions and                     profiles as well.  It is becoming increasingly evident that the                 aerosols and Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSC) play an important                 role in the destruction of the ozone and understanding them is                  crucial to increasing understanding the ozone hole.                                                                                                             This group has been extremely productive in the past, and without               doubt they are the world's experts in stratospheric aerosol                     studies of this kind.  The facilities are unparalleled.",
