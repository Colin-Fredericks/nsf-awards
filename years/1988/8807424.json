 "awd_abstract_narration": "Alginate is an exopolysaccharide synthesized by mucoid                          Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  Its production is transcriptionally                    regulated involving several chromosomally encoded loci.  The                    alginate system is one of the best characterized in                             Pseudomonas and offers solid basis for studying gene                            regulation in these important bacteria.  The purpose of this                    research is to study how environmental and genetic factors                      influence the emergence of mucoid P. aeruginosa strains                         exploiting recent findings of the molecular events governing                    alginate production.  Research will include: 1. Analysis of                     environmental and metabolic factors influencing transcription                   of the algD gene coding for GDPmannose dehydrogenase, a                         critical enzyme for mucoid phenotype.  This will be                             accomplished using the well characterized algD-xylE                             transcription fusion system.  2. Analysis of critical domains                   of the algD promoter by site directed mutagenesis and                           monitoring expression using mutant algD-xy1E transcription                      fusions and S1 nuclease protection analysis.  3. Subcloning,                    DNA sequencing and expression analysis of the algR and algQ                     genes, the positive regulatory elements of algD.  This will                     be done using new methods and vectors for rapid gene                            subcloning and expression, dideoxy chain termination method                     and RNA-DNA hybridization studies.  4. Studies of the nature                    of the algR gene product and algD promoter interaction by in                    vitro and in vivo footprinting and transcription analyses.                      5. Surveying potential role of DNA rearrangements in the alg                    regulatory region for the emergence of mucoid P. aeruginosa                     strains.  6. Comparative studies of the structure and                           function of promoters controlling alginate genes.                                                                                                               These experiments should provide greater understanding of                       the molecular events controlling alginate production by                         mucoid P. aeruginosa.  More general, the proposed studies                       will broaden our knowledge of gene regulation and                               coordination in Pseudomonas and increase our understanding of                   the signal transduction in transcriptional activation                           processes in bacteria.",
