 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major emphasis of recent marine geological studies has                been to relate the detailed geochemistry and petrology of crustal               rocks to the fine-scale features present along mid-ocean ridges.                Initial models of the sea-floor spreading process had assumed                   that crust was created from long, fairly continuous, axial magma                chambers. Although minor variations in chemistry were allowed in                these models, the composition of the erupted lavas was assumed to               be fairly constant. With the advent of detailed mapping systems                 such as Seabeam and Seamarc, a whole new class of processes were                revealed in ridge crest bathymetry. New models emerging from                    these data indicate that the ridge axis is composed of a series                 of small, discrete magmatic segments or individual volcanoes. The               lavas produced from these volcanoes appears in many cases to be                 chemically distinct.                                                                    The objective of the present project is  to examine the                 chemistry of basalts in several of these segments along the East                Pacific Rise using the research submersible Alvin. Previous                     surface ship sampling has defined the gross changes in basalt                   chemistry related to features such as overlapping spreading                     centers, off-set ridge axis, and transform faults. Alvin will now               be used to sample in detail at boundaries between such features.                These data will be used to constrain the nature and distribution                of subsurface magma chambers and their relation to the individual               morphological segments along the ridge axis.                                            The principal investigators are well qualified to complete              the proposed project.",
