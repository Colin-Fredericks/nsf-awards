 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, supported under the U.S.-Japan Program of Cooperation               in Photoconversion and Photosynthesis, will enable collaborative                research between Dr. Judith Croxdale of the University of Wisconsin             and Dr. Kenji Omasa of the Japanese National Institute for                      Environmental Studies in Tsukuba, Japan.  During this research the              investigators will study the sequence and timing of component                   assemblage as photosynthesis develops in light-grown leaves.                                                                                                    Using non-destructive methods, reactions of the photosynthetic                  system will be evaluated by the measurement of chlorophyll                      fluorescence transients, and stomatal opening will be assessed by               infrared thermography.  These measurements will be made using                   recently developed equipment that is interfaced with a digitial                 imaging system which provides in situ determinations.  Dr. Omasa                has developed the new instrumentation at his laboratory at the                  National Institute for Environmental Studies of the Japan                       Environment Agency.  Dr. Croxdale will provide the experimental                 leaf material and the data on structural and biochemical                        differentiation of light-grown leaves.",
