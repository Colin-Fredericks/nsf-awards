 "awd_abstract_narration": "High vacuum technology underlies much of current experimental                   science and \"high technology,\" and provides an excellent basis                  for training advanced undergraduates.  The Physics Department at                Augsburg College will complete the development of a high vacuum                 laboratory featuring four multipurpose vacuum stands (medium high               vacuum, gas analysis with mass spectrometry, gas mixing, and                    ultra high vacuum), and to continue ongoing curriculum                          developments related to this laboratory.  Experiments will                      include topics in atomic and molecular properties using mass                    spectroscopy, plasma physics, gas-surface interactions, and                     vacuum technology.  The equipment to be purchased includes a                    modern quadrupole mass spectrometer, PC-based computer                          controllers and computer-compatible sensors, and selected vacuum                items needed to complete stand fabrication.  The vacuum                         laboratory will be used by both physics and chemistry students in               several upper division courses, and by technical employees in                   local industry enrolled as part of an ongoing educational                       partnership.
