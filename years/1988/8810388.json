 "awd_abstract_narration": "The current trends in computer architecture suggest that in the future          it will be common to use computer networks where some of the nodes are          multiprocessors - either shared memory multiprocessors or distributed           multiprocessors.  In such an environment a parallel application need            not be confined to a single parallel machine.  Instead it can be                composed of several components each executing on a different node of            the network to yield the best possible results.  Each such component            can be viewed as a shared resource providing services to the other              components of the parallel application and the interactions between the         components can be implemented as remote procedure calls.  The issues in         programming the remote components of a parallel application as shared           resources are similiar to the issues in programming shared resources in         general such as file servers and database systems.  In both cases it is         important to implement a shared resource as a parallel system so that           the speed-up possible in parallel applications is not compromised due           to delays in accessing the resource.  This project is to develop an             object oriented parallel programming system called ALPS using which a           parallel application can be implemented efficiently on the multiple             nodes of a network of parallel machines.  The ALPS programming systems          consists of a strongly typed high-level language and a kernel that              forms the run-time support for the ALPS language and which can also be          used from other languages such as C, Pascal and Fortran.  The ALPS              system is currently being implemented on 16-node transputer network.            In the future it is plan to implement it on a 12-processor Encore               Multimax.",
