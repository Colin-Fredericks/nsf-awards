 "awd_abstract_narration": "To enhance our understanding of the operation of the criminal justice           system, systematic study of the way ethnicity affects victimization and         punishments is needed.  Examining the experiences of ethnic groups,             Dr. McKanna studies homicides and lynchings in nineteenth century               California, within two mining camp areas and, during a period in which          Hispanic dominance of agriculture was being replaced by Anglo                   dominance, in the coastal regions.  The data sources being used by this         investigator are rich and varied, including county registers of                 indictments, coroners' reports, prison files, and records on                    applications for pardons as well as newspaper accounts and secondary            sources.  This period in Californian history (1850-1900) is a                   particularly ripe context for examining the interrelationship between           ethnicity, violence, and mechanisms of social control because it was a          time in which power relationships were in flux, and there were                  social tensions surrounding race and ethnicity.  Dr. McKanna's research         contributes to our understanding of violent crime and the operation of          the criminal justice system by carefullly considering the important             questions of what the role of ethnicity is in homicides and whether             minorities receive equal justice before the law.",
