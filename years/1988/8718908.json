 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Wendorf and his international team of collaborators will                    conduct one season's field research at a series of archaeological               sites located in the Eastern Sahara Desert in Egypt.  Previous                  work indicates that a series of Middle Paleolithic sites which                  date to ca. 100,000 years ago are preserved in ancient lake                     sediments.  Dr. Wendorf plans to excavate these and to analyze                  the stone tools and faunal remains which are recovered.                         Information thus obtained will provide insight into both the                    subsistence practices and social organization of these early                    inhabitants of the Sahara.  The team will also collect materials                which will permit reconstruction of the changing environment and                hopefully allow absolute dates to be obtained.  The research will               provide insight into the development of human behavior and show                 how these groups adapted to a highly variable environment.",
