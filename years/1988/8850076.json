 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-week enrichment program in molecular biology at Iowa State           University for twenty high potential rising 7th and 8th grade students          will stress both content instruction and science practice through               laboratory experimentation utilizing research techniques and equipment.         Participants will design, execute and present the results of an                 independent project and will interact with scientists in industrial,            government, and academic laboratories.                                                                                                                          Twenty five lectures will cover relevant topics in chemistry,                   biochemistry, cellular and molecular biology, and biotechnology.  A             college-level text will be used as a reference.  Participants will              spend a minimum of 20 hours per week in the laboratory, carrying out            over twenty projects and developing research skills.  The preliminary           results of their independent projects will be presented at public               forum.  Career exploration will be emphasized through interactions with         scientists, visits to industrial and government laboratories and formal         career planning exercises.  Participants will be encouraged to continue         their independent research project during the academic year by means of         a mentor program, access to research equipment, and a periodic                  newsletter.  They will be assisted in presenting papers at science              fairs, symposia and junior academy of science meetings.",
