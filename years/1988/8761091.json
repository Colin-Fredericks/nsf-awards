 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a great need for safe, energy efficient, on-site methods               for the decontamination of various chemical toxins.  99.8% of all               polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in current electrical                          applications are used as dielectric fluid and amounts to about                  30,000,000 gallons.  The USEPA is reducing the risk of exposure                 to PCBs by requiring the accelerated phaseout of PCB transformers               but there is presently no method available for the on-site                      treatment of PCBs and there is no mild chemical method for their                ultimate disposal.  Envirocon Systems has evaluated a novel PCB                 dechlorination method developed at the University of Louisville                 and believes this method has potential utility for the                          detoxification of transformer PCB fluids that presently represent               a significant health hazard.  Currently the University of                       Louisville hydrogenation method uses expensive noble metal                      catalysts but operates at room temperatures to achieve virtually                complete dehalogenation in minutes.  We propose to work with the                University of Louisville group to systematically evaluate                       different catalysts, solvents and processes in order to find a                  commercially feasible and mobile PCB treatment protocol.  Among                 the major advantages of the method is the avoidance of extreme                  conditions such as high temperatures which, in the case of                      partial pyrolysis, leads to increased production of dioxins and                 dibenzofurans.",
