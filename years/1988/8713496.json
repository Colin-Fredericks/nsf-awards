 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to design and construct a BIOacoustic Sensing                Platform And Relay system (BIOSPAR).  This is an autonomous dual                beam acoustic profiler that will automatically measure and                      telemeter biologically produced acoustic backscattering and target              strength data from remote oceanic locations to shore based                      laboratories.  The down-looking system, with 420 and 120 kHz dual-              beam echo sounders, will be packaged first for autonomous                       deployment in a spar buoy and coupled to a satellite telemetry                  system.  Profiles of acoustic backscattering by range gating                    returns into 1 meter depth intervals in the upper 100 meters will               be obtained.  All data will be stored on a mass storage unit in                 the buoy for post processing.  Partially processed data in the                  form of a target strength histogram and integrated intensity for                10 depth intervals at each frequency will be averaged over 2 hour               intervals for daily transmission to shore.  The system will be                  tested at sea and used on a research cruise in 1990 to study                    variations in the abundance and size-frequency distribution, and                diel migration of plankton and nekton in a Gulf Stream ring.  The               field tests will involve the use of a towed net system to collect               zooplankton and micronekton for comparion with acoustic data.                                                                                                   Designs for alternate deployment modes (bottom landers, deep-sea                moorings) will also be planned.  This instrument offers the                     potential to revolutionize our ability to obtain information about              the distrubution and interactions of important oceanic plankton                 and neckton over periods of time.  Such data is now extremely                   complex and costly to obtain.",
