 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's will test a speculative model for the tectonic setting of              the late Triassic to early middle Jurassic arc in Arizona and                   California.  This continental arc has occupied a deep, fault-                   bounded depression, similar to the present-day arc of Central                   America.  While the modern analogue provides a \"snapshot\" of                    surficial processes in an arc graben-depression, the early                      Mesozoic arc of Arizona and California provides a three-                        dimensional view of what was an extensional arc, as it evolved                  over 50 million years.  The work will either document the                       speculative model or modify it, but the relationships to be                     documented include: (1) determination of patterns and rates of                  subsidence along the arc, using U-Pb zircon geochronology to date               sections of continental  strata; (2) characterization of the                    abundance of high-level rhyolitic intrusions and associated                     calderas, relative to mesozonal plutons; (3) documentation of                   patterns of alkalic volcanism within the arc, using major and                   trace elements that are relatively immobile during greenschist                  grade metamorphism, and (4) recognition of syndepositional normal               faults through facies analysis of sedimentary and volcanic rocks,               as well as by zircon dating of cross-cutting relations between                  faults and intrusions.                                                               Implications of this speculative model, which is based in                  part on our new U-Pb zircon age data, include the possibility that              craton-derived quartz sands were funneled along the length of the               arc graben-depression and distributed across its width, and beyond              to forearc regions, throughout lower and middle Jurassic time.                  These quartz sands would thus be used as \"tracers\" to recognize                 exotic terranes that have been displaced from their site of origin              in the Jurassic arc or forearc region of the southwest Cordilleran              U.S., particularly if the sands can be fingerprinted through U-Pb               dating of detrital zircon.                                                           Continuous belts composed of thick continental arc                         successions may largely originate in extensional settings.  The                 PI's will integrate facies analysis and petrologic study of                     metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks with U-Pb zircon dating to               document patterns of faulting, subsidence and volcanism in a long-              lived arc.  These results can then be applied to interpretation of              more disrupted continental arc successions of all ages and                      localities.",
