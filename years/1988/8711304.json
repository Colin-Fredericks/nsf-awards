 "awd_abstract_narration": "Embryonic growth in viviparous matrotrophic fishes is facilitated by            structural and functional adaptions for maternal-embryonic nutrient             transfer.  Although much is known about the mechanisms of such transfer         in mammalian systems, some reptiles, and teleost fishes, very little            information is available on sharks.  Lombardi proposes to identify and          examine the major cellular, developmental, and physiological mechanisms         of maternal-embryonic nutrient transfer in two representative species           of viviparous matrotrophic shark; Mustelus canis and Rhizoprionodon             terraenovae.  The ultrastructure and physiology of transplacental and           paraplacental transfer will be examined. Objectives of this study are           to: l) describe the ultrastructural morphology of both the maternal and         embryonic adaptions for maternal-embryonic nutrient transfer; 2)                establish a developmental series for both species; 3) determine                 nutrient transfer efficiencies for both species; 4) describe and                quantify protein uptake by embryonic tissues in utero  and in  vitro;           5) analyze the composition of uterine secretions and maternal blood             sera during gestation; 6)assess apendicular function in R. terraenovae;         and 7) identify, characterize, and compare transplacental and                   paraplacental routes of protein transfer in both species.  These                studies are significant because they establish, for the first time, a           morphological and physiological basis for maternal-embryonic nutrient           transfer in viviparous matrotrophic sharks.  Since many of the                  structures involved in maternal-embryonic nutrient transfer in higher           vertebrates are also present in the sharks, the results of these                studies will be integral to an understanding of the function and origin         of the maternal-embryonic relationship in both the fishes and higher            vertebrates.",
