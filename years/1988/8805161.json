 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies on a roughly five million year long Middle Ordovician                   sequence in the Taconic Foreland Basin, New York are addressed to               these questions: How did water temperature and oxygen content vary              with depth in going from a continental carbonate platform down the              outer slope of a subduction trench?  Was oceanic deep circulation               driven by sinking of warm, saline water from low-latitude                       platforms, as has been suggested for this and other times of                    highest sea stand?  Twelve years' background work on the                        stratigraphy and paleontology of the sequence, including an                     ongoing two-year feasibility study, has made a unique opportunity               for answering these and related questions from carbon and oxygen                isotopic studies on shells of bathymetrically wide-ranging benthic              invertebrates, and from carbon analyses of sediments.  Relative                 water depth is measured in terms of position on downslope                       transects along individual volcanic ash layers and, over time,                  through gradient analysis of fossil assemblages.  Relative water                temperature will be determined from oxygen isotopic composition in              one articulate brachiopod (low-Mg calcite), two inarticulate                    brachiopods (calcium phosphate), and other taxa selected for                    comparison.  Evidently, texturally and chemically well-preserved                calcareous brachiopods are isotopically little-altered: specimens               from the same sampling station yield tightly clustered   18                     values similar to those of the best-preserved Middle and Late                   Ordovician material.  The density of puncta on the articulate                   brachiopod's shell (proportional to temperature in modern forms)                is proportional to relative depth, and may provide a check on  28               as a temperature measure.                                                                                                                                       Research will aid in paleoceanographic reconstruction and in                    identification of possible areas for resource exploration.",
