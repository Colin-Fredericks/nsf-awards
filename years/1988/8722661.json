 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This award supports cooperative research by Dr.                   K. Gopalan of the National Geophysical Research Institute, in                   Hyderabad, India with Dr. Douglas Macdougall of Scripps                         Institute of Oceanagraphy.  The work covers geochemical and                     petrogenetic research in the Deccan basalts of India.  The                      field research is to be carried in three areas, in Gujarat in                   western India, in the Rajasthan and in eastern India.  Each                     of these areas contains a different geologic structure and                      possesses a unique relevance to the general field of mantle                     geochemistry.  Samples will be collected and shipped to the                     U.S. where laboratory work will be done at Scripps.                                                                                                             Scope:  Drs. Gopalan and Macdougall have collaborated in this                   research area for several years with significant published                      results and with a number of U.S. graduate students obtaining                   samples and data, for their Ph.D. research, from the field in                   India.  The collaborative effort is productive and the                          results of high quality.  Dr. Macdougall is currently funded                    under two grants:  INT8613485 for field expenses in India;                      and EAR8618554 for research costs in the U.S.  This action is                   being funded under INT8722661 to National Geophysical                           Research Institute and INT8813233 to Scripps Institute.",
