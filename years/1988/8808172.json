 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is the renewal of a study of antarctic sea ice deformation.        It consists of setting out an array of nine data buoys on the annual sea        ice cover of the Ross Sea in June 1988, in order to determine its               movement, rate of deformation, strain rates, and divergence/production          statistics.  The buoys will be dropped from a C-141 aircraft in the             course of the McMurdo mid-winter airdrop mission.  Buoy sensors will            measure surface air pressure and temperature, and transmit this data, as        well as location data, via satellite approximately every two hours.  The        buoys are expected to operate for at least four months, and possibly up         to ten months.                                                                                                                                                  The data will be used in the statistical characterization of the sea ice        kinematics, the sea level pressure field, and the geostrophic wind.  The        strain rate and divergence data when combined with passive microwave            data, can be used to assess the regional and sub-regional ice budget.           The sea ice movement in response to the mean and fluctuating component          of the wind field may be used to assess the relative importance of              forcing by wind and currents, and of the momentum dissipation by                internal ice stresses.                                                                                                                                          The observations from the 1987 array are now in the process of being            analyzed and are being collated with automatic weather station data.            Preliminary studies have shown that the buoy motions can resolve both           synoptic and tidal movements of the sea ice cover, and indicate general         divergence and ice production in the eastern Ross Sea, and convergence          and ridge formation in the western Ross Sea.  This is the first time            that a quantified analysis of this kind has ever been undertaken, and           the first time that the differential motions of the Ross Sea ice cover          have ever been observed.",
