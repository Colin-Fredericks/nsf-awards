 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in physical                     chemistry between Dusan Bratko of the University of Ljubljana and               Lesser Blum of the University of Puerto Rico addresses statistical              and mechanical problems of solvation phenomena in simple solvent                systems and in ionic colloid systems.  The investigators will                   emphasize the thermodynamic and transport properties.  The research             consists in three parts:  study of hard sphere fluid in a confined              system, solvation pehomena in a waterlike liquid and colloidal                  interactions.   The co-investigators have published jointly and are             well recognized for contributions in this field.                                                                                                                This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a                joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and               Yugoslav governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually by            the Department of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  The grants are            composed principally of Yugoslav dinars and made to the principal               Yugoslav institute.  Grants include travel for U.S. scientists to               Yugoslavia and a modest dollar allowance for Yugoslav scientists'               living expenses in the U.S.",
