 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is a planning project that will hold a series of seminars          to focus on the special needs that women have in the study of calculus          and mathematics.  The culminating event will be a faculty retreat and           the writing of a report on the faculty member's \"shared experiences.\"           The project will be at Spelman College, a traditional black institution         for females with strong academic traditions.  The program will include          formal participation by the chairman of the mathematics department at           Agnes Scott College, a female institution with equally strong academic          traditions.                                                                                                                                                     The year will start with three seminars lead by consultants with                special expertise in the area of female studies in mathematics.  The            consultants are:  Elizabeth Fennema, Lenora Bloom and Rhonda Hughes.            These presentations and consultations should senistize the faculty              participants to the special elements of females studying mathematics.           Three additional consultants will assist with three later seminars that         will concentrate on the role of computers in the study of calculus.  In         the spring term, a pilot section of calculus will use and investigate           computer software specially designed to assist in the study of                  calculus.  Three undergraduate students will help with the evaluation           of the materials.  The year will end with a two day retreat in which            the senior personnel and a graduate student will conetrate on the               successful experiences that the faculty members have had in their years         of instructing female students.  With the help of the specialized               consultants, the faculty will be sensitive to the issues, able to               recall and clairify their collected experiences and compile a report of         \"successful shared experiences.\"",
