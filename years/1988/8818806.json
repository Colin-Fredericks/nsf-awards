It           is held biennially in New Hampshire to review the state-of-the-art and          promising directions.  Although the program is structured to cover all          relevant aspects of the field, considerable flexibility is built in so          that truly creative discussions can take place and new directions               emerge.  In the many scientific areas covered by the Gordon program,            the name has become synonymous with quality.                                                                                                                    A 12-month grant is recommended in the amount of $5,000.",
