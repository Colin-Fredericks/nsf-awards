 "awd_abstract_narration": "The severe 1982-83 ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation)                  event caused historically unprecedented and catastrophic                        disturbances to the Eastern Pacific coral reefs.  In the                        aftermath of this event, disturbances to the reefs have                         continued and may have accelerated.  Coupled with low coral                     recruitment, reef recovery could well take many years.  The                     ecological effects and cause(s) of this regional disturbance                    have been investigated by a team of Latin and North American                    colleagues and students in Costa Rica, Panama, and Ecuador                      (Galapagos Islands) from 1983 to 1984 (Smithsonian Institution                  support) and from 1985 to 1987 (NSF support).  This proposal                    focuses on coral reef recovery, disturbance processes per se,                   and retrospective analyses to be studied by a                                   multidisciplinary, international team.  Secondary or delayed                    disturbance effects that will be studied are (a) the disruption                 of biotic barriers allowing predator (Acanthaster planci) entry                 to coral prey refugia, (b) predator (corallivore) concentration                 on surviving coral prey, (c) post-El Nino sea urchin bioerosion                 of damaged reef frames, (d) damselfish colonization of damaged                  massive corals, and (e) damselfish/sea urchin/corallivore                       interactions vis-a-vis massive coral survival.  Recovery                        processes will be studied chiefly with respect to the                           recruitment of calcifying organisms (corals and coralline                       algae) onto formerly occupied reef surfaces including                           examiniation of patch size, character of colonists (asexual or                  sexual propagules), and relative abundances of surrounding                      species.  Retrospective studies (sclerochronology, oxygen and                   carbon stable isotope analyses, cadmium analysis, and                           fluorescent banding patterns) will also be performed on coral                   cores dating back at least to 1601 to provide a long-term                       record of ENSO disturbances. Since it is likely that major El                   Nino disturbances are recurring events, such information should                 provide a firm basis for understanding the processes                            controlling coral reef development and distribution in the                      tropical eastern Pacific.",
