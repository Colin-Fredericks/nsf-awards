 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                    Organometallic Chemistry Program is high oxidation state                        organometallic compounds of osmium, ruthenium and iron. Of                      particular interest is the synthesis of organometallic                          complexes of osmium(VI) and ruthenium(VI) containing two                        pi-donor ligands, which are expected to have greatly enhanced                   reactivity relative to mono-oxo, imido and nitrido complexes.                   The synthesis of organometallic complexes containing high                       oxidation states of iron will be explored as well, beginning                    with attempts to convert stable oxides of iron(IV) and iron(VI)                 to oxo-alkyl complexes. The mechanism of the recently                           discovered method for selective coupling of organic halides and                 Grignard reagents, mediated by nitridoruthenium(VI) complexes,                  will be investigated. Following up on the discovery of a                        heterobimetallic catalyst for the selective oxidation of                        primary alcohols to aldehydes, the oxidation of olefins and                     alcohols with a variety of osmium and ruthenium chromate                        complexes will be explored. The mechanisms of these reactions                   will be studied and their applications in organic synthesis                     will be investigated. Chiral heterobimetallic complexes will be                 prepared for use in asymmetric oxidations.                                                                                                                      This project is expected to lead to useful new catalysts for                    facile transformations of organic compounds.",
