 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Doctoral Dissertation project on the leadership styles of                  black congressmen deals with a topic of considerable interest and               importance to scholars in political science.  The project focuses               on how leadership styles relate to changing district                            characteristics and the need to crate, maintain and satisfy                     biracial coalitions.  At the core of this research is the attempt               to enhance understanding of issues involving the formation and                  maintenance of biracial coalitions and minority representation.                                                                                                 Employing a multiple methods research strategy, the investigator                combines interviews, participant observation, and content                       analysis of secondary data sources.  The objectives of the study                are:  to identify differences in black leadership styles, and the               impact that these styles have in legislative and electoral                      arenas; to determine how these styles relate to changing district               characteristics and the formation and maintenance of biracial                   coalitions; and, to describe how a subset of black congressmen                  view and present themselves to their constituencies at various                  times in their legislative careers.                                                                                                                             This study promises to increase our understanding of legislative                behavior and leadership styles of legislators.",
