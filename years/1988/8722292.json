The object of the conference is               to promote awareness of the relevance of behavioral science                     research and theory to the design of computer and communications                systems for collaborative work, and to stimulate both design                    efforts based on that knowledge and interdisciplinary research                  regarding user satisfaction and competence with advanced                        information systems, as well as the behavioral impact of these                  systems.  Participants include social scientists who have made                  empirical and theoretical contributions to the study of relevant                social and cognitive processes, studied particular forms of                     collaborative work or carried out investigations of the impact of               new technologies, as well as information systems designers. The                 conference includes technology demonstrations at the Planning and               Decision Laboratory at the University of Arizona, a state-of-the-               art facility designed to support computer-mediated brainstorming                and decision-making.",
