 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fractal geometry is a mathematical treatment of the geometry of rough           surfaces that has been applied recently to describe a generic                   turbulent flame.  The proposers believe this method may provide a               mechanism for a modeling breakthrough for the 4-stroke homogeneous              charge spark-ignition (SI) piston engine application.  Unlike the               burning rate models used in previous quasi-dimensional engine codes,            the proposed model for the turbulent burning rate will not require              experimental calibration of adjustable modeling constants.  The                 sensitivity of the model predictions to various modeling parameters,            such as the fractal dimension and the scale of the large eddies, will           be investigated.  The model predictions will be tested against                  available experimental data.                                                                                                                                    The availability of a fractal based turbulent diffusion model would             enable designers to predict combustion phenomena with a model both              simpler and more generic than the current ones.  The current need for           guessing and experimental checking would be largely eliminated, and             computer performance could be dedicated to other aspects of engine              combustion (e.g. geometrical aspects)                                           not currently manageable with the existing unwieldy turbulence                  models.",
