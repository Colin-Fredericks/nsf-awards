 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this research program are to conduct molecular                genetic analyses of the Rhizobium-Legume symbiosis, which, in                   world food production, is  of great agronomic importance.  The                  study of symbioses at the molecular level challenges us to                      understand how two different organisms intertwine their                         fundamental biochemical life processes and interregulate the                    genes responsible for these processes.  To accomplish this, as                  genetic probes, translational, in-frame gene fusions will be                    constructed between Rhizobium N 2 fixation genes and either E.                  coli lacZ (encoding B-galactosidase), uidA (encoding B-                         glucuronidase), or V.  fischerii lux (encoding bacterial                        luciferase) genes by perfect gene replacement.  To understand how               N 2 fixation is orchestrated during both symbiosis and free-                    living bacterial growth, using these gene-engineered Rhizobium                  strains, the regulation of N 2 fixation processes will be                       compared in culture and in planta.  To understand how these                     processes are genetically controlled, the genes responsible for                 this regulation, will be isolated defined Rhizobium mutants in                  which these genes have been altered, will be constructed and the                phenotypes resulting from such alterations will be tested.                      Because it offers a powerful method to manipulate genes in                      defined ways, the capacity to deliver to any bacterium defined                  DNA sequences via phage will be exploited.                                                                                                                      Rhizobium is a genus of gram-negative bacteria which can invade                 the roots of legumes and stimulate the development of root                      nodules.  ln this symbiotic relationship, the bacteria and plant                are able to convert atmospheric nitrogen  (dinitrogen) to                       biologically useful forms by the process known as nitrogen                      fixation.  The goal of this project is to understand the genetic                regulatory events that bring about this symbiosis.  Emphasis                    will be placed on isolating the Rhizobium  genes that participate               in nitrogen fixation and on identifying the mechanisms that                     regulate the expression of these genes.  This is an economically                important area of research as symbiotic nitrogen fixation                       represents an efficient alternative to nitrogen fertilizers.",
