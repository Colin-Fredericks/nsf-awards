 "awd_abstract_narration": "This effort represents the first comprehensive development              of data for U.S. immigrant and emigrant scientists and engineers                (S/E's), much-needed components of the National Science                         Foundation's (NSF) Scientific and Technical Personnel Data System               (STPDS). The proposed work will include a survey of immigrant                   S/E's, verification of emigrant S/E estimates, development of a                 system to measure flows of both immigrant and emigrant S/E's in                 order to derive net immigration, and a feasibility study of non-                immigrants, i.e. \"visitors.\"                                                            Since foreign participation has become an increasingly                  important part of the U.S. S/E labor force, data on immigrant and               emigrant S/E's have become vital to U.S. policy makers in all                   sectors. At present, however, these data represent the most                     serious data gap in the STPDS, the System which measures the                    numbers and characteristics of the Nation's scientists and                      engineers. Major components of the STPDS include: the Survey of                 Natural and Social Scientists and Engineers, the Survey of Recent               Science and Engineering Graduates, and the Survey of Doctoral                   Recipients. All three surveys are conducted biennially for NSF.",
