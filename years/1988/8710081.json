 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI has developed several maintenance-center inventory models; in            each she has considered the problem of determining how many repairable          spare parts to stock at a maintenance center. Complex machines receive          scheduled overhauls at the maintenance center, at which time all                failed parts are removed and replaced by spares. The failed parts are           repaired and returned for use as spares. If a part is needed for an             overhaul while all spares are in the repair shop, the resulting                 shortage is remedied by emergency repair at premium cost. Objectives            have included: (1) maximizing job-completion rate subject to a                  constraining on total inventory investment; (2) minimizing expected             shortage costs, under a similar constraint; (3) determining  the                optimal number of spares and repair strategy when there is a choice of          repair rates, using a Markov decision model; and (4) determining the            optimal replenishment policy when failed spares are sometimes                   condemned as irreparable. In the proposed research, PI will study (1)           multi-echelon inventory models and (2) cyclic queuing networks, in              order to incorporate these ideas into more realistic models.                    This research has been reviewed and recommended for funding under the           program for Research Opportunities for Women, which incorporates                considerations of professional development, in this case through                participation in the operations research program at Stanford                    University.",
