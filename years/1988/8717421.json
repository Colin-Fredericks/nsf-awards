 "awd_abstract_narration": "Copper is released into the environment from many sources,              including the burning of fossil fuels and wood products, mining                 and smelting operations, and through the application of copper                  compounds in agriculture for plant disease control.  Copper has                 accumulated in certain soils and water systems to levels that                   have caused toxic effects on plants, animals, and microorganisms.               Little is known about how organisms can adapt to increased levels               of copper, but such information could have practical value in                   designing methods for detoxifying copper or for genetically                     modifying plants and beneficial microbes for increased tolerance                to copper.                                                                              Dr. Cooksey has isolated copper-resistant bacteria from an              agricultural system where copper compounds are routinely applied                to plants for bacterial disease control.  He has also cloned and                partly characterized the genes that determine copper resistance.                This proposal is to further characterize the genetics of this                   system, and to investigate the physiological basis for copper                   resistance.  Since these bacteria accumulate high levels of                     copper, such that they become bright blue, this system probably                 involves a unique mechanism of metal resistance; other known                    metal resistance systems usually involve either the exclusion of                the toxic metal (with reduced accumulation), or the                             detoxification of the metal by reduction or methylation.  The                   combined molecular genetic and biochemical approaches described                 in the proposal should provide new fundamental information on how               microorganisms can adapt to toxic levels of copper and how they                 interact with this metal at the molecular level.",
