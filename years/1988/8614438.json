Asper will design and construct three                      complimentary camera systems to study the abundance, flux and                   in situ sinking speed of marine snow aggregates.  The first                     system will photograph a well-defined volume of water for                       assessment of the concentration of these aggregates either                      along a vertical profile or through time on a stationary or                     floating mooring.  The second and third cameras are mounted                     normal to (side-looking) and beneath (upward-looking) a                         transparent settling chamber/sediment trap.  The side-looking                   camera will determine the sinking speed of aggregates within                    the settling chamber by observing their fall over a specified                   time interval.  The third camera will measure the flux of                       aggregates by observing their successive arrivals on the clear                  bottom of the trap.  Material collected by the trap will also                   be compared to the images of aggregate arrivals for estimation                  of the composition and mass flux contribution of these                          aggregates.  Combining these measurements will allow accurate                   determination and modeling of the role of these aggregates in                   the vertical flux of particulate matter in any oceanic water                    column.",
