 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfields of mass spectrometry and surface                 science.  The unifying theme of this broad experimental thrust is               the development of new mass spectrometry instrumentation and its                exploitation in the solution of challenging problems in trace                   analysis and materials characterization.  Two related subareas are              being addressed in this project.  One focusses on the study of the              interactions of low energy ions with surfaces.  It seeks to detail              the charge transfer, dissociation, and reaction phenomena that                  occur when relatively low energy monatomic and polyatomic ions                  strike the surfaces of metals and molecular solids. In order to                 carry out these studies, Professor Cooks and his students are                   building a new hybrid mass spectrometer that enables mass, angle,               and kinetic energy selection of both reactant and product ions                  involved in these surface processes.  This instrument also permits              investigation of the chemical modification of surfaces by low                   energy ion deposition and high energy ion impact.  The second                   subarea focusses on the development, characterization, and                      application of two other new mass spectrometry instruments, an ion              trap mass spectrometer and a hybrid magnet and electric sector                  machine.  With these two instruments, collision-activated                       dissociation, photoionization, photodissociation, and ion-molecule              reaction techniques will be used to study phenomena of remote site              fragmentation, thermodynamic vs kinetic control of gas phase                    dissociation processes, the use of doubly charges ions as chemical              ionization reagents, the role of excited electronic states in the               dissociation of small perfluorinated ions, and the formation of                 and reaction chemistry of energetic hypervalent species.                                                                                                        This research will lead to the development of new mass                          spectrometric instrumentation and to improved, sensitive methods                of chemical characterization.  Additionally, this work should give              rise to the continued reassertion of U.S. technology in the area                of mass spectrometry.  This is of particular interest at present                inasmuch as the leading commercial firms in the mass spectrometry               world market are currently in the United Kingdom and in Japan.  It              is expected that the efficient transfer of technology from the                  laboratories of Professor Cooks and other NSF grantees to U.S.                  manufacturers could significantly alter this picture in the next                few years.",
