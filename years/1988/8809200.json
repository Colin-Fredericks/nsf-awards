 "awd_abstract_narration": "A pervasive feature of modern industrial economies is the                       existence of large and persistent wage differentials among                      seemingly similar workers.  Industries such as durable-goods                    manufacturing, mining, transportation, and utilities appear to                  pay wages on the order of 15 to 30 percent higher than those paid               by the retail trade and many service industries to                              observationally equivalent workers.  The pattern of industry wage               differentials is remarkably stable over time and similar across                 countries with distinct labor-market institutions.  These facts                 suggest that the differentials are neither largely transitory                   disequilibrium phenomena nor the artifacts of particular                        collective bargaining institutions or government interventions in               the labor market.                                                                                                                                               This project develops theoretical models that can account for the               stylized facts concerning the observed pattern of these                         differentials across industries and establishments and implements               empirical tests of the new predictions of the models.  This is                  important because the competing explanations of industry wage                   differences produce very different positive and normative                       implications in analyses of several much-debated policy issues.                 For example, one set of theories is consistent with involuntary                 unemployment and labor-market segmentation.  The others are not.                                                                                                In addition to seeking to explain certain kinds of wage                         differentials, the project theoretically and empirically examines               the effects their existence has on labor-market decisions such as               the mobility decisions of employed workers, the recruiting and                  retention policies of employers, and the job-search behavior of                 unemployed workers.  The research emphasizes the roles of                       matching, learning, and asymmetric information in the labor                     market.",
