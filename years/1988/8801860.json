 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed that calcium acts as a messenger in the response                 of plant tissues to signals such as hormones (auxin and                         cytokinin) and light.  The overall objective of Dr. Poovaiah's                  research is to understand this role of calcium ions in plants.                  Recent studies have demonstrated the presence of calcium-                       dependent and calmodulin-dependent protein phosphorylation in a                 number of plant systems.  The focus of the next experiments in                  this study will be calcium- and calmodulin-promoted protein                     kinases and their substrates, with a view toward understanding                  their physiological roles.  Two goals will be pursued:  1.                      Calcium-regulated protein kinases and their substrates will be                  isolated, characterized, and localized by immunocytochemistry.                  2. The substrates for calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein                 kinases will be identified and characterized in order to obtain                 more insight into the physiological significance of calcium and                 calmodulin-dependent protein phosphorylation.                                                                                                                   Hormones, light, and gravity control diverse physiological                      processes throughout the life cycle of plants.  How the cell                    senses these signals and converts them into a response is poorly                understood and is a subject of great interest.  Recent                          investigations support the concept that some hormone and light                  dependent changes in plants involve calcium as a messenger.  The                proposed research is directed toward understanding this function                of calcium.  The results of these studies will advance our                      knowledge of both the cellular functions of calcium and the                     molecular mechanisms involved in the transduction of hormone and                light signals in plants.",
