 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project belongs to the field of macroeconomics, the study of               the behavior of economic aggregates such as employment, inflation               and economic growth.  The objective of the project is to perform                parametric tests for the existence of an economic monetary                      aggregate consistent with economic theory.  Minflex Laurent and                 generalized Barnett models of consumer demand are estimated for                 monetary assets, goods consumption and leisure.  Statistical                    tests are performed against the null hypothesis that different                  groups of monetary assets are weakly separable from other                       consumption goods.  A broad range of monetary assets are analyzed               empirically, stretching from currency and checking accounts to                  small time deposits in credit unions.  The results are used to                  identify groups of monetary assets that are weakly separable from               other goods and can be aggregated into an economic monetary                     aggregate.                                                                                                                                                      Monetary policy is now pretty much hit-or-miss on account of our                inability to get a fix on the demand for money.  A significant                  part of the problem is the establishment of an appropriate                      measure of money.  The official simple sum monetary aggregates                  require the untenable maintained assumption that the summed                     monetary assets are perfect substitutes for one another.  This                  project provides new evidence on the elasticity of substitution                 among different monetary assets and develops a measure of a                     monetary aggregate that is better for formulating monetary policy               than the official measure.",
