 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lipid tubules are rigid, straight, thin-walled, hollow cylinders                with a fixed diameter of about 0.75 micrometers and axial ratios                as high as 2000:1.  The two methods found by the principal                      investigator for fabricating them rely only on the                              self-organizing properties of surfactants in solution, and yet                  allow high yield and good control of the length distribution.                   Once formed, tubules can be stabilized by polymerization, and                   further stabilized by coating with some metals.  Tubules could                  potentially replace graphitic fibers in many of their current                   uses, and they have the added attraction of being intrinsically                 biocompatible for use in biotechnological and medical                           applications.  Research in this emerging area has concentrated on               single-component dispersions of a few similar diacetylenic                      lecithins which were the first found by the principal                           investigators to form tubules.  Unusual packing of the                          hydrocarbon chains and head groups in these lipids may lead to                  the production of a crystalline helical ribbon that can convert                 to a complete tubule.                                                                                                                                           This project initiates two systematic, exploratory searches based               on this theory:  one for the thermal and morphological effects of               mixing tubule-forming lipids with others not believed to form tubules,          and another to determine if lipids not currently known to form tubules          will form them if subjected to appropriate conditions.  The primary             characterization techniques are high power optical microscopy                   under controlled temperatures, and, for higher resolution,",
