 "awd_abstract_narration": "The peripheral nervous system is formed, almost in its entirety                 by neural crest cells that migrate and associate in specific                    areas of the developing embryo.  During the process of                          gangliogenesis these cells acquire particular traits and                        eventually differentiate into the various phenotypes found in the               adult.                                                                                                                                                          The aims of this research are:  (1) to document the development                 of peptidergic phenotypes in the sympathoadrenal branch of the                  peripheral nervous system, from neural crest cells to the                       terminally differentiated state found in the chicken and quail                  adult and (2) to examine the influence of extrinsic factors on                  peptidergic expression by culturing neural crest cells and                      dissociated embryonic ganglion cells in the presence of                         conditioned media, cell free extracts, or hormones, and other                   factors likely to be encountered by developing crest cells.                                                                                                     Results from this project will provide a precise map of the                     peptidergic cell populations in the developing peripheral nervous               system and the time course of their appearance.  They will also                 define the contribution of environmental mechanisms to the                      induction and maintenance of peptidergic phenotypes.  In                        addition, these results will provide basic embryological                        information that could aid considerably our understanding of the                mechanisms underlying the development and plasticity of                         peripheral nervous system.",
