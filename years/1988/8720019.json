 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is one component of collaborative research between                    U.C.-Davis and Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory to determine               the domain structures that are most characteristic in Ti-rich                   titanomagnetites.  Despite many years of study, an adequate                     understanding of the complex domain structures observed on                      titanomagnetite has proved elusive.  Recently, however, it                      has been suggested that most of these structures are controlled                 by strong non-uniform residual stresses which cause their domain                style to vary dramatically with position within single particles.               This hypothesis has profound implications.  However, it is                      possible that the stresses responsible for these unusual domain                 structures are largely artifacts produced by the surface pre-                   paration methods used for domain pattern studies.  Therefore,                   it is imperative to determine which domain structures are truly                 representative of Ti-rich titanomagnetites.  A combination of                   theory and experiment will provide a better understanding of the                domain structures in titanomagnetites and will lead naturally to                a better understanding of their magnetic properties.  Full                      funding is recommended.",
