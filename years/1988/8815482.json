The objective of the research is to                   study the role of induced oxidation prior to biodegradation                     treatment of toxic chemicals.  Three prominent model toxins have                been chosen for study due to their prevalence, differences in                   composition, and expected response.  Hydrogen peroxide oxidation                is studied by adding peroxidase enzyme and hydrogen peroxide                    chemical.  Microbes from toxic waste sites specific for each                    model compound is selected for the microbial degradation process.               Biodegradation rates for each model compound with and without the               forms of hydrogen peroxide is determined.  The acceleration of                  biodegradation due to pre-oxidation is determined by the                        difference in these rates.",
