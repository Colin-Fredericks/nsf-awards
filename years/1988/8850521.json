 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goals of the project are to provide, over a three year period          to fifty elementary and middle school teachers, five graduate level             computer courses to establish a firm base of computer knowledge; and to         apply the didactical structures to enable the teachers to become                computer specialists in their respective schools and districts. A model         has been developed by the principal investigators to retrain teachers at        the grade levels k-9. An aspect of this proposal is to explore the              efficacy of the model. The model includes, in addition to the content           and methodology courses, seminars for elementary and middle school              principals; seminars for the presidents of the home and school                  associations; establishment of a teacher network for the exchange and           dissemination of ideas and materials; designing assessment criteria,            evaluation instruments, and questionnaires for acquiring formative data;        and assessing the extent to which aptitude, attitude, and previous              experience are useful as predictors of performance. The main programming        languages integral to the program are Logo and BASIC. The work is a             cooperative effort by the departments of computer science and                   educational Psychology at Temple University in close collaboration with         Philadelphia School District.                                                                                                                                   Participants for this project are teachers at the elementary and middle         school levels selected from the School District of Philadelphia. An             announcement is sent to each of the schools in Philadelphia with                information on how to apply.     Teachers are selected based upon their         motivation to work with computers, their professional plans when they           finish the program especially how they might apply the results of the           program to their schools as resource teachers.                                                                                                                  The courses offered fall into five categories: Application programs and         how to use them; Introduction to problem solving with Logo; Problem             solving with advanced Logo; Problem solving using structured BASIC; and         Software evaluation and effective uses of computers for teaching. These         courses are to be distributed over the 3 years of the project as the            model dictates.                                                                                                                                                 There is a considerable cost sharing provided by Temple University. The         University has committed $216,740 to the project. At a request from             National Science Foundation (NSF) of $357,042, the University's rate is         216,740/357,042 or over 60% of the amount requested from NSF.",
