 "awd_abstract_narration": "Twenty high school students of high ability and limited chemistry               education background will work for 8 weeks during the summer of 1988 in         the Chemistry Department of Georgia State University.  Women and                students from minority groups will be especially encouraged to apply.           Participants will develop basic research skills and knowledge of                chemical science as they work with practicing scientists in an                  intensive, hands-on, laboratory-oriented project.  In general students          will evaluate the fundamental character of their assigned mixed ligand          solvent extraction reagents, and attempt to use the extraction reagents         to find a solvent extraction system for separating and recovering a             vital metal from a low-grade ore, scrap metal, industrial by-product,           or waste effluent.                                                                                                                                              The need to solve the practical laboratory problem will provide the             rationale for lecture-recitation topics.  Personal contact with the             participants will be maintained about once a month during the following         academic year.  About 25 percent of the lecture time in the summer and          academic year will be devoted to career development and science ethics          topics.  A 2nd summer continuation project is planned wherein about 3/4         of the first summer's participants return to work with their choice of          a faculty research director.",
