 "awd_abstract_narration": "Approximately 30 international experts will be brought together                 in a workshop to discuss the current state of long-term                         ecological research, primarily in North America and Western                     Europe.  They will also consider the future directions for and                  possible future cooperation among long-term research sites on                   both continents.                                                                                                                                                The development of an international network of sites dedicated to               conducting long-term ecological research is a necessary component               of the world scientific community's efforts to study global                     change.  Careful long-term measurements of key ecological                       parameters at sites distributed over the face of the earth will                 permit us to document, in an unambiguous way, changes in                        ecosystem structure and function, and the aerial extent of the                  changes.  With additional information from atmospheric and ocean                scientists we will be able to develop hypotheses about the causes               of change at large scales.  To the degree that we are able to                   link cause and effect we will then be able to develop predictive                models of ecosystem responses to global change.  These models can               be used to develop strategies for the management of the earth's                 ecological resources.  The results of the workshop will be shared               with the world's scientific community through the publication of                the proceedings as a book.                                                                                                                                      The organizing committee for the workshop, lead by Dr. Risser, is               made up of experienced scientists from through out the world.                   The preliminary list of workshop participants is outstanding.                   The opening address is to be given by Dr. Gene Likens, a co-                    founder of the long-term (25 year) ecological study at Hubbard                  Brook.  No better scientist could have been chosen to set a more                appropriate tone for the workshop.",
