 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to provide an interdisciplinary approach for                 undergraduate study of modern data management techniques and an                 interdisciplinary team approach to environmental problem solving.  This         program builds on the Biology Department experience with microcomputer-         based laboratory work stations and the Civil Engineering Department             Design Center concept.  The work stations interface digital laboratory          equipment, hand-held data loggers and weather telemetry instruments with        data acquisition hardware providing rapid data aquisition, computer             analysis and evaluation.  The program focuses on collaborative work in          sanitary and toxic waste management, which requires training in modern          data management techniques and interdisciplinary approaches to problem          solving.  Students learn data management and instrumentation techniques         through course work, laboratory exercises and an interdisciplinary              design project.  Students benefit through learning and practicing modern        data management techniques appropriate to their disciplines and have the        experience of working together as a team to find solutions to the               environmental problems.  This interdisciplinary approach models real            life situations, increases student confidence in problem solving                ability, and opens new career opportunities for students in both                departments.  The grantee provides funds for this project that are an           equal match for the NSF award.",
