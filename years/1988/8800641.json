 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be conducted in the general area of the                      dynamics of conformational change in polymer molecules                          in solution. Experimental studies of oscillatory flow                           birefringence (OFB), viscoelasticity (VE), oscillatory flow                     dichroism (OFD) and time resolved elastic light scattering from                 solutions subjected to periodically time varying flows are to be                carried out.  Some studies will utilize existing instrumentation                for wide effective frequency range measurements in highly viscous               solvents which also provide extensive temperature dependence                    information; new instrumentation providing moderate to high                     frequency VE data will be employed to obtain wide frequency                     coverage in low viscosity solvents.  Additional OFB                             instrumentation for high frequency studies in low viscosity                     solvents will be constructed and characterized.  Detailed                       experimental studies of the effects of concentration,                           temperature, molecular weight, and overall chain topology on OFB                and VE properties will be continued and compared with various                   theoretical predictions.  Bead-spring model calculations of the                 frequency dependence of the polymer contribution to VE and OFB                  properties (dilute solutions) will be continued for regular combs               with randomly placed branch sites, stars with unequal arms, and                 randomly branched chains to assess the potential of chain                       dynamics in general, and these techniques in particular, for                    detailed branching characterization of more typical industrial                  polymers than have been modeled in our previous work.  Studies of               the role of local structure (side groups, tacticity,                            microstructure) and solvating environment modifications in the                  neighborhood of polymer chains will be continued and expanded to                include more widely different polymer structures.",
