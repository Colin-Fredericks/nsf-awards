 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Community College is located on the Lac Courtes Oreilles                    Reservation of rural Northern Wisconsin.  The College population is 95%         Native American, of which 70% are women.  Due to the isolation of the           Northern Wisconsin woodlands and the limited resources of the students,         the College has become the focal point of educational services within           the area.                                                                                                                                                       Prefiously science courses were taught with a minimum of laboratory             work.  Instuctors prepared demonstrations for students to view in the           local high school laboratory which is not equipped for scientific               investigation beyond the secondary curriculum.  The new laboratory              equipment is providing the means to begin to explore Biology and                Chemistry beyond the post-secondary level.  Furthermore, Native                 American students are being given the opportunity to research                   scientific concepts at the experimental level which is consistent with          Native American learning styles.
