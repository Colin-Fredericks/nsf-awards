 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Lynes proposes to develop sensitive and specific polyvalent             antiserum and monoclonal antibody probes to several plant plasma                membrane componments, and to use these probes to analyze those                  components.  He proposes to investigate the tissue and species                  distribution of each component, and to purify these components for              biochemical analysis.  Two specific components of the plant cell, the           fusicoccin receptor molecule and the auxin binding molecule, will be            analyzed and isolated using anti-idiotypic antibodies.  Other components        of the plasma membrane will be analyzed using antibodies generated from         immunizations with relatively crude membrane isolates.  Once antibodies         against the receptor molecules or other membrane constituents have been         induced in the immunized animals, their reactivity will be assessed with        a number of immunological assays, and then the specific immunoglobulins         will be purified.  These antibodies can then be employed in affinity            purifications of components of the plasma membrane that should prove to         be exceptionally fast and efficient, surmounting problems encountered           with previously devised techniques for the purification of membrane             constituents.                                                                       An analysis of the developmental patterns of expression of plasma           membrane associated structures made possible with the tools developed in        this project, will yield insights into the genetic regulation of those          traits, and the differentiation patterns of the cells that express those        traits.",
