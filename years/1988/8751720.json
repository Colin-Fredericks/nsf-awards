 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goals of the project are to offer to 70 elementary and middle          school teachers over a sixteen state region and at schools that service         primarily American Indian students an inservice program that has been           piloted on a much smaller scale on funds contributed by the Bureau of           Indian Affairs (BIA). It is intended to build up a cadre of 70                  mathematics and science teacher-leaders for the BIA operated elementary         and junior high schools across the country. These leaders are to take on        various roles, such as providing demonstration lessons, conducting              inservice sessions, coordinating curriculum development and working with        local agencies to plan improvements at the school or regional levels.           The activities are centered around workshops and their extensions that          were developed in the pilot studies over the past three years. The              initial summer workshop covers a period of eight weeks and emphasizes           these activities: 1) there are to be mathematics courses taught by the          PI according to the methods developed from the pilot experience; 2) one         of the senior faculty members, with assistance from the staff and               participants of the pilot, emphasizes diagnostic and remediation methods        for mathematics skills; and 3) applications of science and mathematics          teaching are to be developed for the American Indian setting by two of          the staff members who have experience in this area and are assisted by a        teacher from a reservation who has applied these methods in her                 teaching. Graduate college credit is available to the participants upon         request. There are to be extensive science and mathematics laboratories         and field trips under the direction of the instructors. The BIA plans to        contribute significantly to the project as well as to provide input to          the project plan and selection of teachers. The BIA, for example, will          fund the development of a curriculum kit at one of the target schools           and will build on the previous work to help in the implementation of the        cadres' contributions in the local regions.",
