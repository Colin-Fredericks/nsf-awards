 "awd_abstract_narration": "Statistics, one of the founders of the discipline, Francis                      Galton, argued, \"are the only tools by which an opening can be                  cut through the formidable thicket of difficulties that bare the                path of those who pursue the science of man and society.\"                       Despite the value of statistics for modern governments, the                     discipline of statistics in the Soviet Union has followed a                     history of wide swings in official acceptance, following, in its                way, the checkered history of genetics in the Soviet Union.                     Professor Kotz, under this grant, will examine these dramatic                   events in order to gain a better understanding not only of the                  turbulent history of this discipline and the difficulties it                    encounters in absorbing and harnessing modern technologies but                  also of how the Soviet Union uses science in the pursuit of                     governmental policies.                                                                                                                                          The history Soviet statistics has gone through essentially five                 periods:  a \"Golden Age\"  (1919-1930) when Soviet statisticians                 were at the forefront of the discipline in the world and provided               important information for the Soviet State;  Stalinist repression               (1931-1952), including the disastrous War years and an imposition               of a rigid, ideological suffocation and isolation for statistics;               a period of slow, erratic recovery under Khrushchev (1953-1964);                stagnation under Brezhnev (1964-83); and a current period of                    substantial reassessment and even upheaval under Gorbachev (1985-               1988).  Professor Kotz will trace the developments through these                periods by following the careers of four prominent Soviet                       statisticians.  He will carry this research out through analysis                and synthesis of the existing scattered, fragmentary publications               (in both Russian and English) available at the Library of                       Congress.",
