 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is mathematical research in the theory of                     operator algebras.  These objects turn up in some formulations of               quantum mechanics, where they (or rather their selfadjoint part)                represent the observables of the system being modeled.  One of                  the basic constructions in this area is the formation of the                    crossed product from a group action on a given algebra.  (In                    physics, the group would most likely be the real numbers, acting                on the algebra of observables by time translation to give the                   dynamics of the system.)  Recently, a dual construction called                  the crossed coproduct has turned out to be very useful,                         especially when the group in question is nonabelian.                                 Professor Gootman will continue his investigations of                      crossed products and coproducts, particularly with an eye to                    studying various properties of these algebras (ideal structure,                 dual topology, type, etc.) by interrelating the use of non-                     commutative duality theory, non-abelian harmonic analysis, and                  representation theory.",
