 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate the use of using acoustic                   signals for quality control in the manufacturing of composites.                 Recent efforts in acoustic microscopy have been found to be very                successful in studying near surface defects in a material.                      The acoustic material signature of a specimen (obtained using an                acoustic microscope) is significantly affected by the surface                   roughness and near surface defects of a material.  However,                     acoustic microscopes still lack the ability to correctly detect                 internal cracks or manufacturing defects within a material if                   these defects are at a depth of a few millimeters or greater from               the surface.  This is because the operating frequency (100 MHz. -               2 GHz.) of acoustic microscopes is too high for penetration into                a material.  In this research, an acoustic microscope operating                 at low frequency (0.1 to 3 MHz.) will be tested in the detection                of internal cracks in a composite plate.  Several modifications                 in the microscope design will be investigated to arrive at the                  best possible design.",
