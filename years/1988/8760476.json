 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Marron lobster, Cherax tenuimanus, is a freshwater                  lobster or crayfish indigenous to southwest Austalia, and is a                  promising new species for United States aquaculture.  It looks                  and tastes like Maine lobster and grows well at high densities in               pond culture, feeding on detrital organisms.  Travers Group, Inc.               (TGI) will conduct Phase I experiments to determine growth rate,                density effects, and reproduction potential of Marron under                     environmental conditions and temperatures found in the                          southeastern U.S.  Phase I experiments will be conducted by TGI                 from February 1 to July 31, 1988 at Auburn University, which                    provides excellent facilities and climatic conditions similar to                southwest Australia.  The experiments will build on initial                     bioassys conducted by TGI and Auburn University in 1986-1987.                   Phase I findings, combined with those from TGI's Marron project                 in Dominica (Caribbean), begun in 1986, and existing Australian                 research results, will be used to design an expanded Phase II                   research and development program.  Density, feed, and polyculture               experiments will be run at two sites in Phase II in preparation                 for Phase III commercial scale project.",
