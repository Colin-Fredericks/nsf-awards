 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this Young Scholars Program at Northern Kentucky University         is to increase the awareness and interest of junior high school and             high school students in mathematics, science and engineering as                 potential career options, by presenting these fields as the tools to            solve exciting problems.  To provide the necessary opportunities, a             two-phase program is proposed for forty 8th, 9th and 10th graders.  The         first phase is a five week commuter program during the summer of 1988,          where activities will focus on research methodology.  The academic year         workshop will focus on selected topics in science and mathematics.              Again, these activities will not only increase participants' skills in          math and science, but encourage them to select courses in school that           will allow them to pursue careers in science, engineering and                   mathematics.  As always, women and minorities will be encouraged to             participate.",
