 "awd_abstract_narration": "Failure-proof performance of tied-back walls during earthquakes is              critical to maintaining transportation corridors for emergency vehicles.        Yet very little research has been done on the seismic response of tied-         back walls.  More importantly, there are no formalized procedures for           the seismic design of tied-back walls.  Possible failure modes have been        identified through computer finite element studies:  what is lacking is         observation of the performance of actual tied-back walls during moderate        to large earthquake shaking.                                                                                                                                    During the Whittier Narrows earthquake, a number of tie-back walls for          building excavations - mostly temporary - were subjected to moderate            earthquake shaking.  Because of temporary nature of these walls, the            information is available for a relatively short time, after which the           data is lost.  In addition, eye witness accounts of the excavation              response may provide information for interpreting the data.                                                                                                     The objective of this research is to collect data on tied-back wall             response during the Whittier Narrows earthquake in order to compare the         field observation of the performance of the tied-back walls to the              results of numerical analyses.  This will help validate the analytical          models for the performance and damage of tied-back walls to earthquake          loading, and it will also help to determine the dependence on wall              geometry, soil profile, location of the anchors, tieoff loads, and              ground motion.  Each case history is being documented in sufficient             detail to facilitate comparison between sites with the numerical                studies.",
