 "awd_abstract_narration": "Commercially available dissolved oxygen probes for bioreactor                   applications have a number of undesirable characteristics such as               calibration drift and flow sensitivity.  By making use of the state-            of-the-art integrated circuit fabrication technology, it is proposed            to develop a steam-sterilizable dissolved oxygen probe, which does not          exhibit these shortcomings.  Also, microprobes with a sensing tip of a          few-micron size are to be developed for monitoring local                        concentrations of various fermentation substrates and products within           the immobilized cell layers.  These proposed sensors are especially             useful for monitoring bioprocesses involving shear-sensitive mammalian          cell cultures and immobilized cells, which gained significant                   industrial importance in recent years.                                                                                                                          A successful application of the microcircuit fabrication technology to          constructing dissolved oxygen probes is expected to open wide ranging           possibilities in fabricating sensors for bioprocess monitoring in               general.  By integrating several sensors on a single chip, many                 parameters can be monitored simultaneously.  By incorporating enzymes           and monoclonal antibodies, sensor chips can be made for detecting               various small and large molecules involved in downstream as well as             upstream bioprocesses.  The proposed microprobes for immobilized cell           applications will enable measurements of layers.  Such                          measurements, which have not been possible previously, are                      expected to help scientists and engineers greatly in studying the               physiological behaviors of the immobilized cells.  The knowledge                obtained can then be applied to optimitzing bioreactor operations               and designs.  The proposed sensors are thus expected to                         contribute significantly in advancing biotechnology, an area of                 national prominence.",
