 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modelling complex large facilities such as manufacturing and assembly           plants, hospitals, airports, and other building types is                        a difficult task because of the great volume and complexity of mixing           traffic streams, the contention for finite resources, and the                   corresponding difficulty of analytically solving this model                     representation.  A new technique, called the Generalized Expansion              method, which models open finite queuing networks with general                  service times, finite waiting room, and multiple classes                        (chains) of customer types will be developed for the design and                 modelling of large complex facilities.  Analytic state dependent flow           models for capturing customer and occupant movement within the                  circulation system of building as a function of congestion in the               circulation system has been recently developed.  The main goal of               this research is to integrate these state dependent flow models with            the Generalized Expansion methodology in order to model large scale             facility planning and design problems.  Techniques such as the                  Generalized Expansion method are very effective and powerful tools              for analytically modelling large scale facilities as queuing networks           because of the complexity of the network, the large number of servers           within the network, and the resultant mixing and superposition of               traffic streams.",
