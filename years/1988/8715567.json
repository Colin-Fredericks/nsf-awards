 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dynamic storage and loss moduli of polymer solutions                   will be measured using an extremely sensitive resonator                         instrument which has been constructed in the principal                          investigator's laboratory.  For dilute polymer solutions, the                   intrinsic moduli will be obtained by concentration extrapolation                of measured moduli; these moduli reflect the molecular relaxation               processes of the polymer chain.  Linear, star, and cyclic random-               coil polymers of matched molecular weights will be studied in                   dilute solutions; polymers in solvents with varying thermodynamic               quality or specific solvent-polymer interactions; polymer with                  side chains which modify their molecular flexibility; block                     copolymers where the blocks can be preferentially solvated;                     polyelectrolytes; and polymers which undergo reversible                         transformations of structural conformation.  In addition, a                     systematic study will be undertaken with respect to modification                of chain relaxations caused by initial chain interactions at low                concentrations where chains just begin to overlap.  For all well-               characterized polymers will be used so that the results will be                 suitable for testing theoretical predications and for comparisons               to complementary experiments.",
