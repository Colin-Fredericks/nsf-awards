 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Joyce and her associates will conduct archaeological research               in the Oloman and Cataguana Valleys located in northeast                        Honduras.  Previous work has indicated the presence of materials                which date to the Late Formative and Classic periods but no                     detailed work has been conducted.  Dr. Joyce and her team will                  use areal photographs to locate probable sites.  During a first                 field trip they will make necessary government and scientific                   contacts in Honduras, find a location for a field headquarters                  and establish a logistic system.  Finally, during a second field                season they will survey promising areas identified from the                     photographs and surface collect ceramics and other cultural                     materials.  On this basis they will then plan a full scale                      project.                                                                                                                                                        Northeast Honduras appears to mark the boundary of the                          prehistoric Mayan empire.  Mayanist archaeologists who wish to                  trace the rise and decline of this entity want to know where                    boundaries were established and how they changed over time.  Dr.                Joyce's project will help to answer this question.  It will also                address the dynamics of so-called \"marginal\" regions.  Some                     archaeologists think these can best be understood in terms of                   relations with core areas, while others argue that such regions                 are best viewed in their own terms.  Dr.Joyce's work will also                  address this issue.",
