 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Association of Systematic Collections will hold a                      workshop on Living and Culture Collections on May 13, 1988 at the               Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois.  The                      purpose of the workshop is to discuss the problems of assembling,               maintaining and using living collections and other non-                         traditional research collections.  Zoos, botanical gardens,                     culture collections and other living and frozen collections,                    including collections of clinical specimens and seed banks, will                be represented.                                                                      The workshop will identify research needs leading to                       formation of living collections, the types of collections that                  exist, approaches to funding (including user fees), and problems                relating to long-term maintenance.  It will also seek a mechanism               to locate the existing collections and evaluate their quality,                  accessibility and importance for research.                                           The workshop will consist of a series of roundtable                        sessions.  Working papers will be distributed prior to the                      meeting.  Follow-up will include formation of a living                          collections committee that will develop strategies possibly                     leading to accreditation of living and culture collections.                          This award provides partial funding to allow some of the key               participants to attend and to defray some of the administrative                 costs of preparing the working papers and reports.//",
