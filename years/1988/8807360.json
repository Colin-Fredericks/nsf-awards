 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation will continue the study of cellular                     control models.  There are three main areas of study in this                    project.  First, the principal investigator will extend his                     analysis of compartmental models which include both time delays                 and spatial effects.  These models are studied to show the                      stability of the differential equations describing the biological               system.  The second area of study details a model for the                       initiation of replication at OriC in E. coli.  The model, which                 is based on biochemical kinetics, is being developed in                         conjunction with ongoing experiments.  The final problem is to                  examine a linear delay differential equation with two time                      delays.  For fixed delays the bifurcation surface is examined                   with respect to the coefficient parameters.  For all three                      problems the project will be applicable to broad classes of                     equations that occur in modeling certain biological and physical                phenomena.",
