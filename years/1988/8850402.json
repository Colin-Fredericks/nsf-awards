 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Massachusetts will plan and convene a small                   invitational conference to stimulate science and mathematics                    department faculty at major research universities to become                     actively involved in the scientific preparation of teachers by                  redesigning introductory science and mathematics courses.  The                  conference will seek to produce collaboration among scientists,                 mathematicians, educators, and cognitive scientists in modernizing              course content, incorporating recent educational research results,              and in the case of science courses, providing opportunities for                 hands-on experiences.  If the conference is successful, the result              should be the development of introductory science courses in which              elementary education majors and liberal arts majors will gain a                 better understanding of science concepts and the nature of                      scientific inquiry.  Cost sharing for the conference by the                     University of Massachusetts is 20%.",
