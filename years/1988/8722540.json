 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the last several years the debate over the litigiousness                of the American population has continued unabated.  On one side                 of the controversy are the observers, scholars, and policymakers                who cite evidence of apparently ever increasing demands on                      America's civil justice system, particularly in the federal                     courts.  On the other side are writers who cite historical,                     comparative, and other analyses that suggest that use of the                    litigation alternative by Americans does not differ greatly                     either from past patterns or from patterns of behavior in other                 developed countries.                                                                 Drawing on a number of existing data sets, Dr. Kritzer will                carry out a comparative analysis (United States and England) of                 the propensity to sue.  The analytic framework will involve                     decomposing \"propensity to sue\" into a sequence of stages and                   transitions, with each of the transitions involving the                         overcoming of a particular type of barrier (i.e., the recognition               barrier, the attribution barrier, the confrontation barrier, and                the litigation barrier).  For each stage of the analysis, a                     variety of factors will be considered--structural factors,                      cultural factors, informational factors, resource factors,                      predisposition factors, and problem-specific factors.  Existing                 data sets (three from the U.S. and four from England) dealing                   with consumer problems and compensation for injury will be used                 supplemented by semi-structured interviews carried out in                       England.  The analysis will focus on the relative influence of                  the factors on the production of grievances (from problems),                    claims (from grievances), and lawsuits (from unsatisfied                        grievances).                                                                         The basic question of people's propensity to sue is an                     important one.  At its core, propensity to sue is a fundamental                 component of the citizenry's attitude toward the legal system and               the role that that system is seen to play in the larger socio-                  political system.  Legal mobilization is a central component of                 political behavior that has been largely neglected by political                 scientists and only recently explored empirically and                           systematically by students of the legal system.  The results of                 this research should considerably advance understanding of                      litigation processes and trends.",
