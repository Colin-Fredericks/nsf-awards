 "awd_abstract_narration": "The accurate measurement of concentrations or fluxes of                    trace gases in the atmosphere is crucial to many areas of                       atmospheric research.  Instrumentation based on tunable diode                   laser absorption spectroscopy has wide generality for detection                 of many atmospheric species.  To date, however, such systems                    have usually been bulky and awkward to operate and do not have                  adequate sensitivity for the measurement of a number of                         important species in the atmosphere at low concentrations.                           The goal of this program is to develop a rapid response,                   high sensitivity sensor using single-mode liquid nitrogen-                      cooled lead-salt diode lasers.  In Phase I of this program,                     techniques that substantially reduce the problem of optical                     fringes in multiple pass absorption cells were developed.                       These fringes are often the limiting factor for achieving high                  sensitivity.  The major objectives of the Phase II research are                 to improve further the sensitivity for infrared diode laser                     absorption and the study methods for simplifying instrument                     design using infrared fiber optics.  A prototype spectrometer                   will be assembled for local field measurements of ambient                       hydrogen peroxide concentrations in order to demonstrate                        ultrasensitve, real-time detection of trace atmospheric                         species.  Results of the Phase II study will provide the                        required design information for Phase III commercial                            development of instrumentation for atmospheric research.",
