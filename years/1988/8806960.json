 "awd_abstract_narration": "The P.I. plans to study the splicing of pre mRNAs carried                  out by HeLa nuclear preparations.  This project will focus on                   the separation and charaterization of proteins and the U-rich                   RNAs that are involved in this process.  He will continue to                    study the interaction of SnRNPs with pre-mRNA as well as                        auxiliary activities that are directly involved in splicing or                  contribute to the specificity of this system.  He specifically                  plans to examine the synthesis of SnRNPs from RNA and proteins                  that constitute these particles.  For this purpose, he plans to                 use labeled RNAs snythesized from cloned DNA sequences that                     code for the U-rich RNAs.  The proteins that interact with                      these RNAs will also be isolated from HeLa cells.  The goal of                  this approach is to reconstitute SnRNPs and to study their role                 in the splicing of pre-mRNAs in higher eukaryotes.                                   The P.I. also proposes to examine the replication of                       bovine papilloma virus with the goal of determining how the                     replication of this DNA is regulated by the host cell cycle.                    He has initiated studies on the replication of this DNA by                      cell-free extracts from mouse cells carrrying a BPV plasmid.                         Significance:  In recent years it has been learned that                    ribonucleic acid (RNA) as well as proteins can act as catalysts                 (enzymes) of metabolic reactions.  In the former case the                       reactions catalyzed have been restricted to those splicing out                  pieces of the RNA transcipts from gene to form a \"messenger\" RNA                of reduced size.  The applicant proposes to continue his studies                of the mechanism by which these RNA catalyzst are put together.",
