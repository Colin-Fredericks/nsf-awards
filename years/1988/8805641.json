 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aging is among the most profound of biological phenomena.               It potentially influences the biology of animals at all levels;                 and the deleterious aspects of aging raise intriguing                           theoretical, empirical, medical, and social problems.  Not                      surprisingly, aging has become a major foucs of research.                       However, most studies have foucsed on aging in laboratory stocks                of inbred animals, and bery few studies have attempted to                       determine whether the resulting findings apply to animals in                    natural populations.                                                                    This proposal investigates aging in natural populations of              lizards.  Huey and Dunham will gather information on how the                    physiology and behavior of these lizards cange as they grow old.                Then they will determine whether declining performance of old                   lizards leads to increased risk of death.  By comparing patterns                of aging in two populations, they will also test an evolutionary                hypothesis on the timing of aging.                                                      This will be the first comprehensive study of aging in any              natural population.  This multidisciplinary approach will be a                  useful advance and further a general understanding of the biology               of aging.",
