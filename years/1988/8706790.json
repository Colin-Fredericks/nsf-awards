 "awd_abstract_narration": "This ia a proposal for continuation of ongoing research                    examining the synaptic circuitry in the mature (Study I) and                    developing (Study II) rat striatum.  The objectives in Study I                  are to determine the synaptic relationships between:  (1)                       dopaminergic afferents from the substantia nigra and intrinsic                  striatal neurons containing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA),                     opioid peptides (Met-and Leu-enkephalin), and acetylcholine; (2)                cholinergic neurons and medium spiny neurons containing GABA or                 opioid peptides; (3) cortical afferents and neurons containing                  one or more of the three intrinsic transmitters.  The major aims                in Study II are to determine whether removal of dopaminergic                    afferents by 6-hydroxdopamine in the early postnatal period                     alters the regional densities of immunoreactivity for                           transmitters in intrinsic neurons; the density or distribution of               cortical afferents; or the ultrastructural morphology of targets                neurons or terminals in the mature striatum.  The primary method                to be used in these studies is electron microscopic                             immunocytochemistry with peroxidase, and radio-iodinated markers                for identification of one or more antigens in single sections of                tissue.  The results from the two studies should be complimentary               and broaden our knowledge of interactions between three major                   types of intrinsic striatal neurons and their synaptic relation                 to dopaminergic and cortical afferents.  This information is                    important for further understanding the etiology and for                        developing improved therapeutic measures for a number of movement               disorders including Parkinson's disease and Huntington's chorea.",
