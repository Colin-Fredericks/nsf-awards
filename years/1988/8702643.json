 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support a theoretical study of tangential               and rotational discontinuities in collisionless plasma by means                 of computer simulations.  Such discontinuities are common and                   important structures in the solar terrestrial environment.  A key               example is the earth's magnetopause, the boundary between the                   terrestrial and solar magnetic fields.  The simulations will be                 performed using one and two dimensional hybrid codes which                      incorporate ion kinetic effects such as viscosity.  The                         simulation results will be used to obtain one and two dimensional               models of the equilibrium structure of these discontinuities.                   The stability of the models, which will include the possibility                 of plasma velocity shear, will be examined.  The results will                   have implications for plasma diffusion, heating, and acceleration               at the magnetopause and discontinuities in the solar wind.                      Throughout this study in situ observations will be used to                      constrain the models.                                                                   The importance of this work in S/T relations concerns the               energy flow form the solar wind to the magnetosphere.  the                      magnetopause transition is clearly important to this process                    which in effect powers much of the magnetosphere's activity e.g.                substorms and aurora.",
