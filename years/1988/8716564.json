 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate the feeding rates, trophic               relationships, and impact of the benthic boundary layer (BBL)                   zooplankton in deep-sea near-bottom communities.  In the                        collaborative investigations, Drs. Wishner and Gowing will obtain               indicators of zooplankton activity in the deep sea and estimate                 of their impact as particle modifiers and energy consumers.  The                new methods for measuring in situ zooplankton ingestion rates,                  with the use of fluorescent particles as unambiguous tracers of                 ingestion, will allow documentation of gut passage time and the                 ability of these zooplankters to respond to the presence of                     food.  Examination of the gut contents of the zooplankton, along                with similar analyses of water column particulates, will enable                 them to determine specific trophic pathways in the deep-sea BBL.                Electron microscopy will make it possible to resolve material                   often labeled amorphous, determine the ultrastructural condition                living or detrital) of the gut contents, and recognize organisms                such as metal-precipitating bacteria.  Since zooplankton ingest                 particulate material and repackage it as fecal pellets, they                    alter the size, density, and composition of the near-bottom                     particulates, and thus may affect benthic and pelagic community                 dynamics and BBL chemical and particulate fluxes.",
