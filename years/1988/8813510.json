 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project provides travel and partial support                  for Dr. Yogesh Jaluria to spend a sabbatical academic year at                   the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, India.  During                    that period he is expected to conduct research on the                           transport processes associated with continuous casting.  The                    study is aimed at a numerical investigation of the effects of                   axial diffusion, thermal buoyancy and conjugate transport on                    the interface shape and characteristics and on the resulting                    thermal field in continuous casting.                                                                                                                            Scope:  Dr. Jaluria is an active scientist with considerable                    experience in the area of metal casting.  He is funded                          separately by CBTE for research in the same area to be done in                  the U.S.  This project allows him to conduct analytical and                     computational study in the area while spending his sabbatical                   at Kanpur, in collaboration with Dr. M.M. Oberai of IIT                         Kanpur.  He will have the necessary computer facility (DEC1090                  computer available at IIT Kanpur) with necessary perpherials.                   Indian graduate students and programmers will assist in the                     work.",
