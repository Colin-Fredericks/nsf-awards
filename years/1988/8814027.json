 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is involved with parallel algorithms for solving for the          roots of large-scale algebraic polynomial and certain general                   nonlinear systems.  These algorithms will be developed based on the             so-called probability-one homotopy method and they world guarantee              finding all the roots.  Particularly, the algorithm techniques are to           be applied to obtain all steady state solutions of the load flow                problem for practical large-scale power systems.  A special                     probability-one homotopy method will be tailored for the load flow to           reduce the computational complexity while still guaranteeing the                finding of all solutions computationally.  A simpler load flow model            will be identified and employed first.  Then its solutions will be              used in order to efficiently obtain the solutions of the full load              flow model.  More importantly and practically, numerical                        implementation of the solution techniques will exploit inherent                 parallelism in the techniques to be efficiently executed on massively           parallel distributed-memory multiprocessors.  This constitutes the              first phase of the proposed research.                                                                                                                           The second phase of this research project is concerned with local               stability and the possible bifurcation of the solutions to the load             flow as well as their role and impact on the dynamic behavior of power          networks.",
