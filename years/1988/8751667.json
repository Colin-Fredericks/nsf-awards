 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the next three years the University of Tulsa will conduct a series         of four week workshops for regional elementary and secondary biology            teachers, and their principals, in the areas of modern molecular                genetics and cellular biology.  This project was designed in direct             response to the expressed needs and requests of regional teachers,              principals and superintendents who, in every instance, listed a lack of         knowledge in modern molecular genetics and cellular biology as their            primary deficiency in the teaching and/or understanding of modern               biology.                                                                                                                                                        Twenty teachers per year and their principals will participate in this          program which will serve as the basis for an articulated regional               biology program.  The workshop will be heavily content-based with               researchers from universities, research institutes, and private industry        acting as presenters on the specific topics with which they are working.        Half of each day will be spent in the laboratory dealing with the               experiential aspects of the topics covered in the lecture portions.             Teachers and Master Teachers working together will also \"translate\" the         lab activities to the appropriate level for students.                                                                                                           Elementary and secondary teachers and administrators will work together         to create an articulated educational model. Presentations by                    superintendents who have been successful in implementing an articulated         curriculum, a concurrent principal's workshop, and a rigorous evaluation        of the project will be implemented.  Previous experience has                    demonstrated that a combined elementary/secondary program can be                extremely successful in fostering change in a school district.                                                                                                  The University of Tulsa, the Tulsa Educational Foundation and the               participating school districts have contributed 24% as their share of           the cost of this project.",
