 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the use of polyoxometalates and                   other inorganic oxometal species, which are themselves                          resistant to oxidation, to catalyze redox transformations of                    organic compounds of low reactivity, such as alkanes. The                       immediate goals are to establish the origins of the stability                   of these catalytic hydrocarbon functionalization systems and to                 determine the mechanistic and structure-reactivity features of                  these processes by kinetics, spectroscopic and structural                       studies.  These new polyoxometalate-based catalytic                             photochemical processes are of potential utility with respect                   to not only alkane functionalization but also the conversion                    and storage of radiant energy. The work should lead to                          improvements in the existing processes, delineation of new                      spectroscopic phenomena, and development of new catalytic                       processes.                                                                                                                                                      There have been two types of homogeneous catalytic hydrocarbon                  functionalization processes based on polyoxometalates. The                      first involves the photochemical functionalization of alkanes,                  and coupling potentially useful synthetic transformations with                  the simultaneous conversion of light into chemical energy.  The                 second involves the thermal transfer of oxo and related groups                  into hydrocarbons. The physical, photochemical and                              photophysical attributes of several recently documented                         interactions between various classes of organic substrates and                  polyoxometalates will be probed by picosecond and other                         spectroscopic studies, X-ray crystallography and photochemical                  experiments.These experiments are expected to yield further                     information on the potential applications of soluble oxometal                   species to redox transformations of organic and inorganic                       molecules.",
