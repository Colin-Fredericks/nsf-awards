 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Phytotron at Duke University is a large integrated                     facility for biological research under controlled environments.                 Central mechanical and environmental monitoring equipment                       operated by a trained professional staff provides excellent and                 dependable environmental control.  The facility is available to                 all scientists who require well-controlled environmental                        conditions for their experiments.                                                    Future developments planned for the facility are to install                new lighting and control systems to improve the quality of                      environmental control and the dependability of equipment.  A new                computerized monitoring system will provide more environmental                  sensing and more frequent updating of chamber conditions.  Energy               conservation measures initiated by the staff and by the Duke                    University Energy Management Section will be continued.                              Efforts will be continued to develop unique analytical                     capabilities.  In addition to the high-energy carbon-11                         analytical facility now in operation, a mass spectrometer                       facility will be installed by Duke.  Existing storage space will                be renovated by the University into modern physiological research               laboratories to support a growing program in ecological research.                    This project will provide funds for the continued basic                    operation of this national environmental control facility.   NSF                funds will be supplemented by space charges to users and by an                  operational budget from Duke University.",
