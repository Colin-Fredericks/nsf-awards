 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will contribute to fundamental understanding of           the role plant growth regulators or hormones play in mediating plant            growth and differentiation.                                                                                                                                     The objective is to clone and characterize the gene(s) for 1-                   aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase in tomato.  ACC              synthase is the limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of ethylene, a              hormone whose level acts to coordinate the expression of many genes.            Physiological studies indicate that this synthase is a highly regulated         gene/enzyme that is induced by wounding, application of auxin or                ethylene and plant development e.g. during fruit ripening.  Its                 expression represents an important plant response to integrate the              immediate environment with the plant's developmental programs.  The             project seeks to characterize the expression of this gene(s) in the             various organs of the tomato plant, with a special focus in tomato fruit        during ripening.  ACC synthase activity, protein and RNA will be                quantitated with gene specific probes, in order to determine what limits        ACC synthase expression and to determine whether the various inducers           and developmental programs use common and/or diverse mechanisms.                Genetic studies indicate that only a small number of genes are required         for the control of ACC synthase expression in fruit.  As an initial             test, two of these mutants rin and nor that do not undergo fruit                ripening will be characterized.  It will be determined whether these            mutations have altered ACC synthase genes or whether they define other          genes, possibly receptors that regulate, ACC synthase expression in             tomato fruit.",
