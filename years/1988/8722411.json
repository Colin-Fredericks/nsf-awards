 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the interaction of plastocyanin                       with cytochrome f and the interaction of cytochrome f with                      the Rieske iron sulfur protein to learn the interacting                         domains and the path of electrons through these proteins.                       The function of cytochrome c550 in cyanobacteria and algae                      will be studied to learn the catalytic role of this protein.                    The synthesis and structure of a special class of carotenoid                    proteins in cyanobacteria will be examined.  The structures                     of proteins in a halophytic cyanobacterium will be                              investigated to understand the adaptation of protein and                        membrane structures to extremely high salt concentrations.%%%                                                                                                   This project supports a study of the structure of proteins                      which participate in photosynthetic energy conversion.  The                     objective is to better define the structures of and the                         interactions between these proteins.  Cyanobacteria will be                     the main objects of study since they afford unique                              experimental advantages.  Cyanobacteria are, in most                            respects, very similar to other O2 evolving algae and higher                    plants.  They are easily grown and are especially well suited                   for recombinant DNA experiments.  Their simplicity provides                     advantages to the understanding of photosynthetic processes                     in all plants.  Their long history and special adaptations to                   harsh environments provide advantages for understanding the                     evolution of the photosynthetic apparatus.***//",
