 "awd_abstract_narration": "This equipment is for the support of an interdisciplinary effort to             address both scientific issues and technological problems related to            extremely thermophilic archaebacteria and their associated                      biomolecules.  Initially, two microorganisms capable of growth at               temperatures at or above 100\u001aC (Pyrodictium brockii and Pyrococcus              furiosus) will be used in these studies.  Work will focus on their              microbial physiology, optimization of growth rate and biomass yield,            protein purification, and structure/function relationships for                  selected enzymes (including hydrogenases).  Efforts to clone genes for          selected enzymes from these thermophilic bacteria into mesophilic               bacteria will also be pursued.                                                                                                                                  The results from this study will be important in several areas ranging          from understanding the basis for protein thermostability to the myriad          of engineering problems associated with large-scale cultivation of              these and related microorganisms.  Among the many applications that             might result from this work are the isolation of thermally stable               enzymes that offer advantages over those now finding widespread use,            such as proteases, amylases, lipases, ligases, polymerases, etc.                These advantages include higher reaction rates, better stability, and           lower sensitivity to denaturing conditions.  Another interesting                application of the                                                              sulfur-reducing potential of these bacteria is the removal of                   certain sulfur forms from coal.  Opportunities involving novel                  biotransformations should also arise and will have to be explored               as our understanding of these unique bacteria develops.",
