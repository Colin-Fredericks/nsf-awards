 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry                        Program supports basic research which involves synthesis,                       structure, dynamics and reactivity of early transition metal                    compounds.  This area of research has significance to synthetic                 fuels made from carbon dioxide.                                                                                                                                 This project requests funds to support synthetic organometallic                 research to prepare thermally stable and highly reactive                        early-transition metal complexes possessing both methylated                     allyl ligands and halide ligands.  These new compounds will                     allow replacement of the ubiquitous cyclopentadienyl ligand                     with allyl ligands in heterometallic early-late-transition                      metal complexes.  Such heterometallics have not yet                             demonstrated the kind of cooperative bimetallic reactivity that                 has been hoped, such as CO2 complexation.  By replacing Cp                      ligands with allyl ligands in these complexes, reactivity at                    the early-transition metal center and the first instance of                     true early-late-transition metal cooperativity should be                        achieved.  The main efforts of this research project, the                       preparation, manipulation, and characterization of new                          air-sensitive early-transition metal allyl complexes, are being                 performed entirely at Hope College by undergraduate researchers                 involved in semester and summer research.",
