 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports several short term research visits to the Federal           Republic of Germany by Robert Soare and Theodore Slaman of the                  University of Chicago and Steffen Lempp of Yale University in order             to collaborate with Klaus Ambos-Spies of the University of Heidelberg           in several topics of mathematical logic.  In particular, they will              pursue research on recursive function theory and the theory of                  computation.  The University of Chicago (where Lempp recently                   obtained his PhD) is a major center of research on these topics and             these U.S. mathematicians have produced some outstanding                        contributions to the field.  Germany has a long and distinguished               tradition in this field as well, and Professor Ambos-Spies is a                 leading figure in recursive function theory there.  He has also done            extensive research in applications of the methods of recursive                  function theory to computational complexity.  Previous intermittent             collaboration between Professors Soare and Ambos-Spies has been                 mutually stimulating and productive.  The proposed visits will allow            more frequent collaboration between them and the inclusion of two               other U.S. mathematicians whose work is directly relevant to that of            Ambos-Spies.                                                                                                                                                    Mathematical logic and particularly recursive function theory and the           theory of computation have recently been very active in the U.S. and            abroad.  Recursion theory arises from an attempt to formalize what it           means for a set to be mechanically definable, and thus it has                   applications to theoretical computer science and the theory of                  computational complexity.",
