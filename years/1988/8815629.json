 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to examine the influence of                   different polymeric substrates on cell behavior, cell morphology,               organization of cellular structural proteins, and gene expression.  It          will also assist understanding cell/polymer interactions to develop             novel polymeric systems for sustained cell growth.  The sustained               growth and function of mammalian cells on solid substrates depends on           the physiochemical nature of the substrate.  Although the molecular             basis of this phenomenon is not well understood, it is of major                 importance in the development of large-scale cell culture and                   artificial internal organs.  The approach is interdisciplinary,                 involving the integration of engineering methods with biochemical and           molecular biology techniques.  Unique polymer surfaces, including               bioerodable surfaces, will be created by custom synthesis and by                modification with supercritical fluid solvents; these surface will be           completely characterized in terms of surface chemistry, roughness, and          surface energy. Fibroblasts and hepatocytes will be cultured on a               variety of polymer surfaces.  Changes in cell behavior, cytoskeletal            organization, and expression of specific genes in response to these             surfaces will be determined by quantitative computer-assisted                   microscopy and biochemical analysis.  By controlling and examining              molecular changes at several different levels -- from the polymer               surface to cellular protein -- changes in substrate properties with             the precise effect on cell function will be correlated.  Finally,               novel substrates will then provide a local release of biologically              important factors without the addition of media serum supplements,",
