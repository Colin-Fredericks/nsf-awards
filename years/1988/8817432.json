These changes have been brought about by the                introduction of advanced solid-state control technology, new materials          that are being or can be applied to advanced machine designs, more              powerful computational techniques for analyzing electrical machines             and drives, and the user need to have drive systems that are more               efficient and that precisely match the requirements of the process.                                                                                             A workshop is being held to present and review needed research in the           field of advanced electrical machines and drive systems.  The results           of this workshop will be an identified research program, the goals of           which will be to advance the state of energy conversion.  It is                 expected that new and novel drive system ideas and research objectives          that extend beyond the traditional technologies will result from this           workshop.",
