 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigators (PI) will conduct research to:                 (1) develop new conceptual frameworks and models for studying                   multiaccess communication, optical fiber communication, and data                networks.  The framework is a collection of models, theoretical                 structures, and bodies of engineering understanding that                        interface appropriately with insights flowing from one to the                   other, (2) to solve the problems posed above by analysis and by                 creation of new algorithms, and (3) to synthesize these solutions               into insights about the tradeoffs in the engineering of                         efficient, reliable communication networks.                                          The research will be interdisciplinary and involve                         information theory, particularly coding theorems of point-to-                   point and multiaccess systems; communication systems,                           particularly modulation, signal structures, detection,                          synchronization, and acquisition; queueing theory, and computer                 science, particularly distributed algorithms, algorithmic                       complexity, and hierarchial layering.",
