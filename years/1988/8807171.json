 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knowledge-based techniques are being used to solve an increasingly wide         range of complex problems and this has resulted in higher performance           demands for symbolic computation.  Researchers have therefore shown             great interest in exploiting the inherent parallelism in logic                  programming languages such as Prolog.  Among the many approaches which          have been proposed, DeGroot's Restricted And-Parallelism (RAP)                  execution model seems particularly promising.  This model is notable in         that it achieves a great deal of parallelism automatically, i.e.,               without explicit commands from the programmer, yet the run-time support         mechanisms have low overhead.  This is accomplished by compiling                programs into special control expressions, called Execution Graph               Expressions (EGEs), which initiate goals on the basis of tests on               program variables.                                                                                                                                              Research on the RAP model has focused primarily on the problem of               implementing EGEs efficiently on multiprocessor computers.  The                 research proposed here will focus on the complementary problem of               compiling clauses into EGEs.  A clause is first converted into a graph-         based computational form which achieves Maximal And-Parallelism.  This          graph is then gradually transformed into an EGE, potentially at a loss          of parallelism, using two rewrite rules over a hybrid execution model.          A specific compilation algorithms for Prolog using this framework will          be designed, developed and evaluated.",
