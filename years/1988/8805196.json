These            meetings are held at the Marine Biological Labs in Woods Hole, MA, where        200-300 participants gather in an area isolated from other diversions.                                                                                          The meeting this year is on the control of secretion, which involves the        molecular mechanisms which induce and bring about secretion, as well as         the physical processes which occur within the cell -                            compartmentalization, vesicle fusion and endocytosis.  New technology           has led to investigations on calcium and other ion channels in the              stimulus and secretion.  Many aspects of these processes, in a variety          of cell types, will be discussed at this meeting.  The meeting is open          to students as well as senior investigators, and there are plans for            publication of the talks.  This is an important area in biology, which          because of technical developments is likely to provide new information.",
