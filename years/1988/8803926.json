 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although soil scientist have been studying the chemistry of                iron in soils for many years, there have been relatively few                    studies of the magnetic properties of soils.  Most of the studies               have focussed on the enhancement of the magnetic susceptibility in              the upper portion of the soil.  For the past year and a half, the               Principal Investigator has been studying the rock magnetic                      properties of three soil chronosequences in California, noting                  that the rock magnetic properties vary within different horizons                of the same soil profile or pedon and between pedons of different               age developed in the same parent material.  Results have also                   shown that the enhancement of the magnetic susceptibility is a                  more  complex phenomenon than previously thought.  This project                 investigates other chronosequences in California and extends work               to include additional rock magnetic parameters.  The goal of this               research will be to gain new insights into the basic pedogenic                  processes involved in the translocation and transformation of iron              in soils and to use that information to develop a relative, if not              an absolute, method of dating soils.  Such a dating technique                   would have wide applicability, not only for the dating of soils on              stable geomorphic surfaces but also for the dating of various                   surficial processes such as hillslope development and landsliding.",
