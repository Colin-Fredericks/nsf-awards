 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is to develop a methodology based on fuzzy set            theory for the utilization of uncertain and imprecise data in                   regression and interpolation, with further application to reliability           analysis.  Specifically, fuzzy regression modeling in the cases of              both symmetric and non-symmetric membership functions will be                   investigated using various regression performance measures, applied to          linear and nonlinear regression.  Fuzzy interpolation techniques will           be developed using spline interpolation and kriging.  As a result of            the proposed methodological developments, guidelines will be provided           for the proper use of fuzzy set and Bayesian techniques in technical            areas including design issues in hazardous waste facilities and the             reliability assessment of structures and geo-environmental systems.                                                                                             This project is in cooperation with proposal ECS-8802920 by                     L. Duckstein.  Both PIs are renowned in fuzzy set research and well             qualified to conduct the research.  Their respective institutions,              Nebraska and Arizona provide more than suitable environments for the            work.  An award at the level of $19,865 is recommended for FY88 with a          continuation for $44,579 for FY89.",
