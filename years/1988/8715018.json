 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to understand why animals have evolved to behave in               the ways that they do, it is necessary to understand the function               of their behaviors within particular social or ecological                       contexts.  A basic idea about male mating behavior is that in                   species where single females are abundant, males will mate with                 several females, but in species where females are rare, males                   will mate monogamously and may physically defend their mate from                other males.  However, the value of this generality is weakened                 because the varied species used to make such a comparison differ                in many biologically significant ways that may also affect their                mating behavior.  Dr. Charnov and his student, Mr. Carroll, have                chosen to study a single species of semi-social insect, which in                some habitats has equal numbers of the sexes and in other                       habitats has many more males than females.  The investigators                   will compare the mating behavior of males between the two                       habitats to see whether the insects have evolved the responses to               female availability that the theory predicts, and thereby provide               a more direct test of the theory than has been possible with                    multi-species comparisons.                                                           In addition to testing theoretical predictions in an active                area of biology, the research will focus attention on the                       importance of studying differences between individuals within                   insect species, rather than simply lumping variations into the                  species-wide averages and generalities that have often typified                 the study of economically important insects.  Greater                           understanding of such differences is likely to lead to the                      identification of key points in the life cycle at which control                 measures can be taken with minimal impact on the environment.",
