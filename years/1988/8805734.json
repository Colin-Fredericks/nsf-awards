 "awd_abstract_narration": "Term rewriting systems have gained considerable attention in recent             years for being a convenient tool in programming languages, automated           deduction, data type specification and verification, computer algebra,          and as a bridge between logic and programming.  The theory of term              rewriting has developed rapidly and new areas of applications are being         explored.  However, not much seems to be known about the computational          aspects of rewrite operations.  This proposal addresses the basic               operations that are pertinent to rewriting and the means to design and          analyze the associated algorithms.  Both practical algorithms and lower         bound complexities, on sequential and parallel machines, will be                studied.  Research in the design of good algorithms for rewrite                 operations will be useful in improving the efficienty of rewrite-based          systems as well as in providing an understanding into the inherent              complexities and limitations of rewrite methods.",
