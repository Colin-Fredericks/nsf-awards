 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a collaborative workshop between a group of             U.S. researchers headed by Professors Darrell Doyle and Morton                  Rothstein of SUNY at Buffalo, and a similar group of Italian                    researchers headed by Professors E. Bergamini and P. L. Ipata of the            University of Pisa on the subject of protein metabolism in aging.               Alterations of protein metabolism represent an important facet of the           aging process.  While it is known that a number of changes take                 place, the mechanisms behind these changes are poorly defined.  For             example, cell-free protein synthesizing systems from various tissues            of old animals function less effectively than those from equivalent             young preparations with highly significant differences.  More recent            work has demonstrated that old rat liver ribosomes are deficient in a           protein factor present in young ribosomes.  On a broader scale,                 protein turnover has been shown to slow substantially with age,                 although the reasons are obscure.  Alterations in enzyme structure              with age is an area that can be presumed to lead to physiological               consequences also.  Modifications of hormone receptors would also be            expected to play a role in regulation of metabolism regulation.                 These are a few examples of a variety of current and ongoing                    investigations related to aging and protein changes.  The purpose of            convening the proposed meeting is to increase our understanding of              what is known about protein structure, regulation, and metabolism as            it relates to aging.                                                                                                                                            While there have been other meetings related to protein turnover,               none so far has focused on age-related changes in protein structure             and metabolism, together with selected topics in important related              areas.  Giving the aging population in the U.S. this topic is one of            increasing interest for basic research.  A workshop getting together            researchers in the U.S. with leading researchers in Italy, where a              strong focus on aging research has developed, has the potential to              lead to successful exchange of information and to future                        collaborative projects in this important area.",
