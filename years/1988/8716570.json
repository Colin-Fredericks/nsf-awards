 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program                  supports research by Prof. J. K. Kochi, University of Houston,                  aimed at understanding the dynamics of oxidation-reduction and                  single-electron-transfer processes in the activation of organic                 and organometallic compounds.  Though this work is directed at                  elucidating the fundamental steps involved in bond activation,                  it also has direct applicability to homogeneous catalysis of                    industrially important chemical reactions and to understanding                  enzymatic catalysis of biological processes.                                                                                                                    This project will focus on six studies designed to elucidate                    and utilize the charge-transfer phenomenon in chemical                          dynamics, especially of transient ions and radicals formed in                   solution from molecular electron donor-acceptor complexes.                      This work has potential application to solar energy storage and                 to development of molecular memories.  Specifically, work will                  be carried out on:  (1) charge-transfer theory and the                          activated complex, using time-resolved spectroscopy; (2)                        isolation and molecular structures of donor-acceptor complexes;                 (3) direct examination of the dynamics of transient ion                         radicals and ion pairs; (4) photochemical promotion of organic                  donor-acceptor interactions; (5) organometallic compounds as                    electron donors in solution and in the solid state; and (6)                     photoredox reactions of cations and anions.  This work                          continues research previously supported by Foundation grant,                    CHE-8401324.",
