 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of the punching shear resistance of thick plates and shells           made of reinforced concrete will be conducted.  In order to perform             the study, a new constitutive law for cracked concrete will be                  developed which allows cracks to form in many non-orthogonal                    directions and which correctly models the interface shear transfer              characteristics of concrete, in particular the friction and dilatancy           behavior of cracks in combination with the fracture energy associated           with the crack.  Existing test results will be analyzed and used to             quantify and refine the improved material models.                               The analytical study will be performed using two dimensional finite             elements, solid three dimensional finite elements and a new                     innovative approach to layered plate and shell elements whereby shear           deformation is more accurately represented than in usual layered                theory.  Further, both the possibility of shear failure and the                 inclusion of stirrups are considered.                                           A series of plates and shells will be analyzed to verify the validity           of the approach and the appropriateness of the new material models.             The final series of plates and shells to be analyzed will be the                series of tests that were recently performed at the National Bureau             of Standards under a separate contract.  These tests simulate                   punching shear due to concentrated ice forces acting on offshore                structures.  These tests have already been analyzed reasonably                  successfully using improved material models.                                    Finally, the program developed will be used to perform a series of              parameter studies in order to develop simplified design equations.              Parameters to be studied include shear reinforcement ratios, shell              curvature, and boundary conditions.",
