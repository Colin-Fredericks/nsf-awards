 "awd_abstract_narration": "Killer yeasts produce extracellular proteins that are toxic             to other yeasts.  The yeast Pichia kluyveri has several forms                   that differ in their ability to make killer toxins.  The                        differences are known to be determined by nuclear genes in the                  natural populations of this yeast.  The research described in                   this proposal will investigate the effects of the genes                         controlling killer toxin production in P. kluyveri on the ability               of this yeast to survive and reproduce.                                                 The research is primarily focused on the problem of how                 genes for production of killer toxins are maintained in natural                 populations and why some populations contain both killer positive               and killer negative strains.  This work should add to our                       understanding of how genetic diversity is maintained in natural                 communities as well as the role of killer systems in the natural                environment.  Killer yeasts are also important as contaminants in               industry, particularly the brewing industry, so this research may               be useful in understanding the killer yeasts that are problems in               industrial fermentation.",
