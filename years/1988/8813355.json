 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central focus for studies in science, technology and                          society is the development and management of complex                            technologies.  These efforts raise correspondingly complex                      ethical and value concerns which must be confronted and                         reconciled in the process.  This project addresses key value                    issues -- those concerning development and those affecting                      health and safety -- involved in siting potentially hazardous                   technology in developing countries, by multinational                            corporations.  The research team -- composed of U.S.                            researchers and cooperating scientists from the developing                      countries -- will conduct a detailed analysis of two to four                    cases involving the location of industrial plants overseas.                     An advisory panel will oversee the research process.                                                                                                            The research plan has several parts: content and document                       analysis; selection of cases; study of the cases from the                       perspectives of the various stakeholders; identification and                    analysis of values issues; testing of hypotheses and                            development of a model of the decision process; and critique                    of policies, plans, and codes of conduct on the basis of what                   has been learned.  A major book and a number of scholarly                       articles will summarize the findings of the project.  Results                   will also be made available in appropriate international                        forums and in summaries and reports to the stakeholders.                                                                                                        This complex project addresses some very important issues.                      The research team is uniquely qualified, by virtue of past                      research and international experience, to undertake it.  The                    advisory group is appropriate; institutional support is very                    good.  The project is designed well and plans for the                           dissemination of results are good.  It is likely that follow-                   on efforts will continue after the period of this award.                        First year support in the amount of $93,338 is recommended.                     Upon receipt of a satisfactory report on progress, the                          remaining support will be granted.",
