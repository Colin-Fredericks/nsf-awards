 "awd_abstract_narration": "This model project is designed to raise the aspirations and preparation         levels of young women in the middle and junior high school grades,              which represents a strategic point in the academic development of               women, to increase their awareness of the wide range of science and             technology related career opportunities open to them provided they              prepare themselves academically.  These objectives are being realized           by putting these students in direct and continuing contact with role            models, both college students and professionals.  The schedule of               project activities includes three one-day programs at Georgia Tech, two         for public schools and one for private schools.  Approximately 300              students and 30 sponsors (teachers, counselors, parents) attend each            session.  Twenty to thirty women in various science and technology              related careers, together with twenty college science students,                 interact with each group of students.  Graduate students or faculty             will provide laboratory demonstrations involving science or engineering         projects.  A follow-upn newsletter that will urge a response will be            sent to each student in order that the impact of the program will be            enhanced.  The evaluation component of the project includes in depth            surveys of students and counselors to determine changes in the types of         curricula pursued, and changes in career plans as a result of                   participation.  Future plans include the development of programs of             longer duration in which young women would be in residence on the               campus for several days.  The network of presenters will be expanded to         include faculty at neighboring institutions, such as the Communicable           Disease Center.",
