 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this project is to increase the                   capability of dextrous robot hands to flexibly manipulate unknown               objects in unstructured environments.  Tactile sensing will be                  used to determine global properties of an unknown object using                  class models, rather than specific object models.  Specific goals               of the project include:  1)  extracting sufficient knowledge from               local surface information to grasp an manipulate unknown objects,               and 2)  determining as much about the object as is possible from                sparse sensory information, particularly from only an initial                   grasp.  Cylindrical tactile fingertips have already been                        developed, and algorithms for extracting local contact properties               have been demonstrated, namely position, orientation, total                     force, and radii of curvature for a convex second-order surface.                Global properties including size, location, and orientation will                be determined from the local contact shape at multiple                          simultaneous finger contacts.  An object class of cones will                    be assumed, and geometric constraints will be                                   derived from the measurements.  In experiments, an unknown cone                 will be touched with 3 tactile sensors.  Additional touch probes                may be required to find the cone's global properties.",
