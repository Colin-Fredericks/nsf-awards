 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to study the Northern Juan de Fuca Ridge              using high-density aeromagnetic data.  Approximately 2600 sq. mi.               were covered at a track spacing of 1 nm. during a survey                        performed by the Canadian government in 1986.  The area included                the Endeavor and West Valley segments, the Middle Valley and the                Heck and Heckle seamount chains.   The analyses of the magnetic                 data will address a number of scientific questions.  Among them                 are the variation of the Central Anomaly Magnetic High along                    strike of the Endeavor Segment, thermal or alteration                           demagnetization of the crust in the high-temperature sedimented                 Middle Valley, and magnetization of the Heck and Heckle                         Seamounts. To constrain the forward modeling, magnetic property                 determinations of existing samples will be made.  The PI will                   also perform forward modeling of the magnetic signature of the                  10-15 km scale blocks located in the Sovanco Fracture Zone in                   order to determine whether competing hypotheses for the nature of               these blocks can be resolved by high-density magnetic data.                     These studies are important for determining the cost                            effectiveness of high-density aeromagnetic data as a tool for                   marine geophysical studies.  The sites chosen for study are                     important because the data will help us understand how small                    tectonic plates evolve near a subduction zone.",
