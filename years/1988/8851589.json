 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to broaden and strengthen the                     undergraduate program in Biology, with particular impact on                     departmental majors whose programs emphasize the subdisciplines of              Botany or Ecology.  The acquisition of a modern photosynthesis                  instrument system (portable infra-red gas analyzer which measures               photosynthetic gas exchange and instantaneously computes photosynthetic         rate, water-use-efficiency, intercellular CO2 concentration, and                stomatal conductance) will allow the introduction into the curriculum           of modern courses in Plant Physiology and Plant Physiological Ecology.                                                                                               The photosynthesis system will be used by students in the                  laboratory and in the field to measure and evaluate the                         interrelationship between plants and the environment.  This system is           ideal for teaching undergraduate students about plant physiological             processes because it allows them to collect and analyze real data, thus         creating a favorable climate for learning the scientific methods that           are critical to designing and conducting meaningful experiments.  The           system also will be used for science demonstrations in outreach                 programs for pre-college students, thus serving the additional goal of          interesting uncommitted students.                                                                                                                                    The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
