 "awd_abstract_narration": "Investors lacking inside information know that insiders trade in                the stock market.  So, why do those lacking this information bother to          trade?  Even money managers seem unable to \"beat the market\".  So, why          do they continue to try, and why do their clients continue to pay for           their services?  Further, how do individuals structure their portfolios         and why are portfolios typically not fully diversified?  Why do                 investors prefer particular positions such as covered call-options?             These are some of the central questions in the area of behavioral               finance that this project will address.  The standard theory in finance         is based on the assumption of the \"rational man\" who attempts to                maximize expected utility as he chooses among investment alternatives.          However, standard finance-theory offers no compelling answers to these          questions.  This project will develop and test a finance model which            incorporates psychological factors and provides a clearer understanding         of individual investment and financial-market behavior.  The model will         include errors of cognition, regret, and the framing of choices.                                                                                                The functioning of securities markets has been the focus of much                debate recently.  A major issue is the role of government in regulating         these markets.  Should laws prohibiting insider trading be strengthened         or abolished?  Should the small investor have special protection and if         so, how could this be done?   This project is important because it will         shed light on this issue.",
