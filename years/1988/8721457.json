 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research explores the financial and economic determinants of               air carrier safety performance.  One of the most widely discussed               and perhaps most controversial effect of airline deregulation has               been the perceived decline in air safety.  This project                         investigates the determinants of air carrier safety, with                       particular attention to the question of whether less profitable                 or financially insecure carriers provide less safety to their                   passengers.  The first stage of the project develops a model of                 air carrier accident rates as a function of carriers' risk                      exposure, traffic and operating characteristics, and financial                  condition.  This model is estimated on panel data for large U.S.                jet carriers over the l957-l986 period.  The second stage of the                project explores the possibility of developing alternative safety               indicators, including incidents, inspection results, and direct                 measures of safety inputs such as maintenance expenditures.  The                results should provide insights on the effect of economic                       deregulation on air carrier safety performance.",
