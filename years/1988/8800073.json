 "awd_abstract_narration": "A mobile fluid phase forms an important component of the                   crust in orogenic zones.  The late Mesozoic-early Tertiary                      Coastal Orogen of British Columbia and Alaska provides a setting                that includes low to high grade metamorphic rocks and tonalite to               granodiorite plutons for investigating fluid-rock interactions.                 This project focuses on:  the character the fluids associated                   with the metamorphic rocks, with the plutons, and with the quartz               and pegmatite veins that cut these rocks; the paths followed by                 fluids as they are produced and move through the crust; relative                timing of fluid evolution, vein formation and deformation; and                  estimates of fluid volumes and thermal consequences of fluid                    flow.  Major results that can be expected from the study include                a better understanding of the nature of the fluids in this                      portion of the crust, of the mechanism by which fluid moves and                 transports both dissolved matter and heat, and of the role fluids               play in rock deformation in orogenic zones.                                          Professor Crawford will participate as a guest in courses or               seminars in metamorphic petrology, isotope geochemistry, fluid                  inclusion techniques, regional geology and tectonics.                                This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1)                 to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                  engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF                  and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and                     engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists                and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic                    institutions.  By encouraging the participation of women in                     science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future                     scientific vitality.",
