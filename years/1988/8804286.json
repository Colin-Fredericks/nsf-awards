 "awd_abstract_narration": "Structural engineering and design has in the past, focused on life              safety and the prevention of major structural damage during and                 earthquake.  The Whittier-Narrows earthquake of October 1, 1987, has            shown that performance of non-structural items that effect building             mission performance to be very important and can have significant               effects on economic damage.                                                                                                                                     This research project focuses on seismic design implications/lessons            from the extensive non-structural building component damage caused by           the Whittier, California Earthquake with emphasis on effects at the             CSU-LA campus.  The research focuses on the performances and behavior           of the interior (e.g., partitions, stair enclosure walls) as well as            exterior (e.g., cladding curtain-walls, screen-walls) building                  components; as well as their influence on the overall seismic behavior          of building systems.  Available data on damage of interior building             components and exterior building components as well as building                 contents is categorized and analyzed.  This includes details of the             configuration of buildings, their structural systems, with respect to           building components, as well as building component repair cost data.            This is followed by selected case-studies of two buildings on the CSU-          LA campus that suffered significant non-structural damage in addition           to structural damage.                                                                                                                                           The results and conclusions of this research will be more                       effective methods of deriving lessons from observed damage during               severe earthquakes; building component damage during earthquakes;               valuable practical data on the performance and behavior of                      interior non-structural walls and exterior facade/cladding                      systems; and their influence on the overall response and behavior               of building systems during earthquakes.",
