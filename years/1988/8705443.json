 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this 3-year project is to learn more about               territoriality, using a population of birds in which cooperative                family units defend large territories all year.  The study is in                part a continuation of a long-term study of population biology in               a very illuminating species of bird, in which social cooperation                characterizes the Florida race but is absent throughout the                     species' distribution in Western North America.  For 17 years the               investigators have monitored the details of births, movements,                  matings, territorial habits, and deaths of hundreds of scrub                    jays.  This grant will permit continued monitoring of the                       population for three additional years.  More important, it will                 allow a major investigation into the factors that cause some                    groups to defend large territories and others to be equally                     successful in small ones.  The role of territory quality as it                  affects reproductive success will also  be investigated.                                These objectives will be met by carefully measuring the                 habitat features and food resources of each territory (or                       representative ones) over all seasons for three years.  The                     results will allow the investigators to estimate the relative                   quality of territories already mapped during the preceding 17                   years of the study, because the habitat has remained essentially                constant over that period.  The final results will provide unique               insight into the dynamics and roles of permanent territoriality                 within a non-migratory, socially cooperative animal species.  The               implications of this study will extend generally to a wide group                of animal species that have evolved cooperative behavior as a                   means of coping with chronically crowded environmental                          conditions.",
