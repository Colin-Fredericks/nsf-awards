 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nicholas Korevaar will continue his work on surfaces of                    constant mean curvature in three dimensional space. Historically                most research was directed at surfaces of zero mean curvature,                  these are known as minimal surfaces. Prototypical examples being                soap films. During the last five years there has been a great                   deal of activity in the realm of non-zero mean curvature; here                  soap bubbles are the typical examples. This work received its                   impetus from Wente's counterexample to the Hopf conjecture.                     During the last year Kapouleas has shown how to construct many                  more such examples of different topological types. Korevaar's                   work is in many ways complementary to this and a natural                        development in the sense that he is looking at the structure that               such surfaces must have rather than attempting to construct more                examples.                                                                            Korevaar's earlier work with his collaborators has led to a                good understanding of the behaviour of these surfaces near to                   infinity. His attention will now turn to an investigation of the                structure in bounded regions of space. This will involve an                     interaction of ideas from geometry and the theory of partial                    differential equations. He will also carry out related research                 into capillarity questions and into convexity theorems for                      solutions of elliptic equations.",
