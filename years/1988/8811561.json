 "awd_abstract_narration": "This interdisciplinary research project is concerned with the fields            of chemical engineering and biology and involves isolation of proteins          from hyperthermophilic bacteria.  Study of biomolecules from these              novel microorganisms requires creative approches to optimizing growth,          separating bioproducts, and isolating proteins.  Using a blend of two           purification schemes, affinity chromatography and high liquid                   chromotography, in a recently developed technique - high performance            liquid affinity chromatography (HPLAC) - selected proteins from                 thermophiles and hyperthermophiles will be isolated and purified.  In           this combination, advantage is taken of the selectivity of the                  affinity system and the speed and high resolution of the liquid                 system.                                                                         The use of the HPLAC technique is expected to eliminate the high                protein losses associated with multistep purification.  The stability           of proteins from hyperthermophilic bacteria is of great interest in             optimizing high temperature reactions in industry.",
