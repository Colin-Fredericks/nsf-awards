 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the molecular ion (dtu-)+, the deuteron and tritium are                 confined by the muon in a region small enough that fusion between               the two nuclei can take place.  A large amount of energy is                     released as a result of this fusion process, thus raising the                   possibility of using it for energy production.  Theoretical                     studies of this molecule have been extensive.  But the effect of                the nuclear force has not been dealt with in satisfactory detail                in current theoretical calculations, due to lack of a proper                    computational framework.  This research will develop a better                   calculational method to handle these three-body systems, and to                 calculate reliable fusion parameters.  Accurate knowledge of                    these fusion parameters are essential for the energy production                 process.                                                                             The interactive portion consists of counseling women                       students on career opportunities, as well as lectures and                       summaries to be given on this topic at the host unviversity and                 at local high schools.  The purpose of these lectures will not be               merely introducing and stimulating interest in muon catalyzed                   fusion as a possible new energy source, but emphasizing the                     importance of basic energy research for the long range future.                       This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1)                 to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                  engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF                  and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and                     engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists                and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic                    institutions.  By encouraging the participation of women in                     science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future                     scientific vitality.",
