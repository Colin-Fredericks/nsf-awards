 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI's research interests are in developing theory to describe those              properties of linear feedback systems that are relevant to design.  Of          particular interest is the way in which the structure of a system to            be controlled limits the performance and robustness properties                  achievable through feedback design.  In the scalar  case, plants with           nonminimum phase zeros, unstable poles, and time delays cause design            difficulty.  These properties can also appear in multivariable                  systems.  However, in this context they are less well understood, and           seek to develop a mathematical framework within which to explore their          properties.                                                                                                                                                     Multivariable systems can also possess properties having no analogue            in the scalar case.  Among these are directionality properties due to           loop interactions and to plant ill-conditioning.  He seeks to                   understand these properties and the design tradeoffs and limitations            that they impose.  He then plans to incorporate this knowledge into             various existing design methodologies as well as to develop new                 methodologies.                                                                                                                                                  His ultimate research goal is to understand feedback system properties          sufficiently well that rules of thumb may be developed to aid in                design.  This task will involve both development of the necessary               theory, as well as a substantial effort to translate that theory into           the language of the practicing engineer.",
