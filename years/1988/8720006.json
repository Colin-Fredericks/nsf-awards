 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with new applications of topology               to molecular biology and chemistry, and consists of three                       projects.  The first is knot theory and DNA, in which the                       analytical ability of knot theory and the precise new                           experimental techniques of molecular biology (gel electrophoresis               and rec A enhanced electron microscopy) are combined to study                   enzyme  mechanism and substrate configuration.  The second is the               topological modelling of rotating spiral wave phenomena in                      excitable media.  The techniques of differential topology can be                combined with the algebraic topology of knot theory to quantize                 these wave patterns, and to describe the time evolution of these                patterns.  The third is polymers and the statistical mechanics of               knots, in which knot theory and self-avoiding random walk                       statistics are used to model volume exclusion effects for                       polymers of high molecular weight in dilute solution.  Some                     computer computation, simulation and graphics will be required on               these projects.",
