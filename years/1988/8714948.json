 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in molecular-electron                  collisions and photoionization between Vincent McKoy at Caltech                 and three Brazilian colleagues: M.A.P. Lima and L.M. Brescansin                 of the Universidad Estadual de Campinas, and L.E. Machado, of                   the Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos in Brazil.  The                          researchers intend to study the collisions of low-energy                        electrons with molecules and the photoionization of nonlinear                   polyatomic molecules.  This work is based on a Schwinger                        variational principle specifically formulated for                               electron-molecule collisions and, for molecular photoionization,                on a numerical solution of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation using                separable potentials.                                                                                                                                           Professor McKoy's group at Caltech is one of the leading groups                 in the area of electron impact molecular excitations.  Their                    publications have been of highest quality and he has a wide                     international reputation. The Brazilian scientists have all                     worked with the group at Caltech in recent years and have                       established research groups in Brazil with graduate students and                other scientists. The proposed work will continue their fruitful                international collaboration.",
