 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intricate growth of the VAM fungus within the root                          cortical cells raises questions as to the molecular nature of                   key events which permit the symbiosis.  The proposed studies                    will test the role of fungal products in regulating plant                       mechanisms which could control hyphal development.  The                         hypotheses invoke VAM fungal products to effect plasmalemma                     function and the defense potential of the host cell.  Studies                   will probe whether fungal products alter key plasmalemma                        enzyme activities such as ATPase and NAD(P)H oxidase which                      could regulate ion and nutrient flux between organisms.                         Effects on defense mechanisms will be studied by screening                      for altered levels of compounds and enzymes which have                          putative roles in plant resistance.  Molecular biology                          techniques will be used to determine the extent of changes in                   plant gene expression which are triggered by VAM fungal                         components.%%%                                                                                                                                                  Healthy plant development may require symbiosis to be                           established between the plant root and certain beneficial                       fungi which form mycorrhizae.  Approximately 90% of all                         higher plants form vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizae.  VA                   mycorrhizae are produced by the colonization of the cortical                                                                                                    cells of fine feeder roots of plants by fungal hyphae.  The                                                                                                     hyphae extend out into the soil and create an enhanced                                                                                                          feeding area from which nutrients can be extracted and                                                                                                          utilized by the plant.  Mycorrhizal plants often demonstrate                                                                                                    increased uptake of phosphorus, trace metals and other                                                                                                          sparingly soluble nutrients.  Greater tolerance to drought                                                                                                      and improved resistance to some root diseases have been                                                                                                         reported for mycorrhizal plants.  Consequently mycorrhizal                                                                                                      plants frequently exhibit increased growth yield and survival                                                                                                   over non-mycorrhizal plants especially on less fertile soil.                                                                                                    These beneficial effects of VAM formation hold considerable                                                                                                     potential for improving plant production in agriculture,                                                                                                        forestry, reclamation, and horticulture.
