 "awd_abstract_narration": "In classical physics, the role of probability was primarily to                  express ignorance and opinion.  Probability was needed because                  the physicist simply did not have enough information to make an                 absolute determination.  In principle, however, as with Pascal's                \"superman,\"  if scientists had sufficient prior information, they               would not need probabilities.  The quantum revolution of the 20th               century, however, denied such certainly is ever possible, even                  with infinite knowledge of the prior conditions.  Einstein                      objected to quantum theory, because of its denial of ever                       achieving certainty, that \"God does not play dice with the                      Universe.\"  In this research project, Professor Van Fraassen is                 examining these two differing aspects of the use of probabilities               in physics i.e. that which is due to \"ignorance or opinion\" given               insufficient prior information, and that due to theories like                   quantum theory which deny the possibility of certainty.                                                                                                         The first problem is a general one:  what belief is involved                    concerning the actual world, in the acceptance of a (n                          irreducibly) statistical theory?  To formulate this more                        precisely, the concept of belief is replaced by that of opinion,                represented as personal probability.  There is a generally                      accepted recipe for how opinions about objective chance (physical               probability) constrain opinions about what will actually happen.                Any solution to the first problem may be required to entail the                 correctness of this recipe; other requirements may also be laid                 down.                                                                                                                                                           The second problem is specific to contemporary physics:  what                   interpretation can we give to the probabilities it presents with                their characteristic features of \"probability interference\" and                 \"loss of individual identity\"?  Professor Van Fraassen will                     investigate this problem with special reference to one                          interpretation of quantum theory, (the Copenhagen variation of                  the modal interpretation), and one area in quantum theory                       (statistical behavior of identical particles).",
