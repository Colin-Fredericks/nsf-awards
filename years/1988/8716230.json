 "awd_abstract_narration": "The photosynthetic mechanism by which light energy is                           converted into chemical energy will only be fully understood                    after the molecular architecture of all the components                          involved in the process has been determined.  Thus it is                        needed to know how each polypeptide functions, how it is                        folded, how cofactors are associated with it and how it is                      arranged with respect to other polypeptides and to the                          membrane.                                                                                                                                                       The goal of Dr. Thornber's research is to contribute to an                      understanding of the light energy trapping and its conversion                   into chemical energy during photosynthesis.  The major                          interest is in those photosynthetic components that contain                     chlorophyll and carotenoid molecules.  Recently he was able                     to isolate and partially characterize nine carotenoid-                          chlorophyll-protein complexes from higher plant thylakoids.                     For the first time it is now possible to purify these nine                      pigment-proteins without losing any chlorophyll or probably                     carotenoid, molecules that are present in the components in                     situ.  Crystals have also been made of two of them.  A                          thorough analysis of each complex will be made.",
