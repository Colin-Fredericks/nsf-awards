 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Telecommunications Policy Research Conference series, now in                its sixteenth year, continues to serve as the principal forum for               the telecommunications community for those doing both theoretical               and applied research on telecommunications topics.  The Sixteenth               Annual Conference is to be held October 31 . November 1, 1988 in                Airlie, Virginia.  The Conference brings together researchers of                varied disciplines from universities, research institutes,                      industry and public interest organizations with government                      policymakers in a setting conducive to open and fruitful exchange               of information and ideas.  The Conference will facilitate the                   development of rational, coherent telecommunications policy by                  presenting the results of the best available research on a wide                 range of key telecommunications policy issues, by clarifying the                policy research agenda, and by stimulating new research that will               be useful for policy purposes.                                                                                                                                  The topics to be addressed at the Conference reflect the broad                  range of key policy issues that confront the nation in its                      transition to a services.based, market.oriented information                     economy.  The dissemination of the very best current research                   relevant to these issues ensures that the policy.making community               has at its disposal the most recent and the highest quality                     intellectual capital to aid its deliberations in this most                      important and controversial industry.",
