 "awd_abstract_narration": "The most active and exciting area in international economics                    currently consists of research like this project that synthesizes               international trade theory and the theory of industrial                         organizations.  This project develops models that allow                         consideration of the important dynamic issues that arise in the                 context of growth and development in an integrated world economy.               A distinctive feature of the approach to these issues in                        comparison with earlier studies of international trade is the                   focus on the evolution of productivity change.  Recent advances                 in the economics of research and development and                                learning-by-doing in markets with imperfect competition permit                  the construction of models in which innovation is endogenous to                 the model of international trade and not determined by factors                  outside the model.                                                                                                                                              Case studies of post-war economic performance provide ample                     evidence of a systematic relationship between a country's trade                 regime and its long-run performance.  For example, trade                        figures prominently in the Japanese success story.  Yet                         existing trade theory predicts one-shot static effects of trade                 instead of the long-term dynamic regularities observed in the                   data.  This project develops a dynamic theory that explains the                 empirical regularities and provides a basis for assessing                       competing explanations.                                                                                                                                         This project contributes to our understanding of the link                       between trading opportunities, trade strategy, and economic                     growth.  It also provides new and better explanations of                        dynamic processes in world trade identified by empirical                        researchers.  This project addresses such important questions as:               Do outward-looking, export-oriented less developed economies grow               faster than those that concentrate instead on domestic markets?                 Does such a prescription hold for all points in time?  And is                   welfare maximized by a policy of benign neglect or active                       promotion of exports?  For the case of the industrially                         advanced countries, should industrial policies be used to                       promote domestic firms in their dynamic international                           competitions?  How does trade policy influence the rate of                      technological innovation?  What scope exists for international                  cooperation to maximize overall growth of the global economy?",
