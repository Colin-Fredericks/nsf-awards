 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bacterial invasion of crop plants is a major cause of                      economic damage.  Plant breeders have for a long time attempted                 to develop cultivars that are resistant to phytopathogenic                      bacteria.  The objective of this proposal is to apply modern                    genetic engineering to achieve the same aim.  Specifically, the                 approach is to express a lysozyme  of high specific activity in                 a plant and thus render it resistant to bacterial infection.                    The gene of hen egg-white lysozyme is selected for                              manipulation.  An intronless version of this gene has been                      shown to be expressible in yeast.  In Phase I the concentration                 of hen egg-white lysozyme required to lyse several species of                   phytopathogenic bacteria under physiological conditions will be                 determined.  If the results indicate that hen egg-white                         lysozyme is effective at a concentration that is expected to be                 achievable through transformation and expression in a plant,                    then Phase II support will be requested to insert the lysozyme                  gene into the genome of tobacco and the transformants tested                    for resistance to a series of a bacterial pathogens.",
