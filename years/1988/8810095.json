 "awd_abstract_narration": "Progress in the neurobiology of learning and memory has                         benefitted recently by the discovery that the hippocampus and                   associated brain structures play an important role in \"working                  memory,\" the type of memory that allows us to recall specific                   recent events.  Major successes in creating animal models of                    working memory have come from the development of the delayed non-               match to sample (DNMS) paradigm, a working memory test that                     involves three sequential phases:  A cue phase when the memory                  cue is presented, a delay phase during which the animal must                    remember the cue, and a choice phase during which the animal must               recognize and reject the memory cue in favor of an alternative.                 Investigators have shown that damage to the hippocampal system                  results in severe impairments on performance in DNMS, indicating                that this system is critical to information processing for                      working memory.                                                                                                                                                 This research is aimed at determining what role the circuitry of                the hippocampus plays in DNMS.  Dr. Eichenbaum's strategy is to                 exploit the rats' striking learning and memory capacities with                  olfactory and spatial stimuli to describe the neural correlates                 of memory for these distinct types of information.  He is                       recording the electrophysiological activity of single neurons in                the hippocampus as rats perform DNMS tasks using either odors or                places as the memory cues.  By comparing the firing rates of                    neurons across the three phases of the task, he will be able to                 identify which component of memory activates hippocampal                        circuits, that is, whether the hippocampus is primarily involved                in storage (cue phase), in holding (delay phase), or in                         recognition (choice phase).  In addition, by comparing neuronal                 firing rates across the two categories of memory cues (odor and                 place), he will be able to determine the general, rather than                   stimulus-specific, qualities of cues that are processed by the                  hippocampus.",
