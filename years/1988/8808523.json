 "awd_abstract_narration": "To obtain depth information and a 3-D description of the objects                in a robot work cell, a number of passive and active methods have               been proposed.  One is a stereo vision technique that uses two                  cameras at different viewpoints.                                                                                                                                The major issue in any stereo vision system is the correspondence               problem.  In this work, a multi-channel feature-based stereo                    vision technique is proposed in which curve segments are used as                the feature primitives in the matching process.  A relaxation                   technique is used to obtain a global match betwen the curve                     segments in the left and in the right image.  Local information                 about the curve segments as well as the structural information                  about the objects in the scene are incorporated into the stereo                 technique.  The specific goals are:                                                     1.  to develop the proposed stereo technique, and evaluate              its performance on a large number of stereo images;                                     2.  to integrate the stereo technique into an operational               robot work cell;                                                                        3.  to evaluate its operformance, and compare with existing             techniques.",
