 "awd_abstract_narration": "An understanding of how and why a protein folds into its                        native conformation is of major biological importance.                          Although much work has been done on this problem still                          relatively little is known about the details of the process.                                                                                                    Dr. Fink is studying the factors which determine a particular                   folding pathway and hence native structure.  The long-term                      goals are to learn the \"rules\" by which the amino acid                          sequence of a polypeptide guides the folding path to the                        native state.  Dr. Fink will use: 1) specific signals or                        probes in different regions of the molecule to aid                              determining the order in which the protein folds and unfolds;                   2) site-specific mutants to facilitate the formation of                         protein with environment-sensitive probes in unique and                         selected sites and probe the role of individual amino                           acids on the folding; and 3) subzero temperatures and                           aqueous-methanol cryosolvents to permit the stabilization and                   characterization of partially-folded intermediates in both                      unfolding and refolding.",
