 "awd_abstract_narration": "They will investigate structure, structural relaxation, atomic                  interdiffusion and crystallization of ultrathin (1-20nm)                        amorphous silicon and germanium semiconductor films by applying                 vibrational and optical spectroscopies to amorphous superlattice                structures.  They will also investigate size and interface                      effects in nanocrystalline (<20nm crystallites) materials formed                by annealing or otherwise treating amorphous superlattice                       structures.  Research efforts will include:  1) Development and                 application of vibrational Raman scattering as a probe of                       amorphous network strain (i.e. - bond distortions) and                          compositional mixing at and near amorphous interfaces.  2)                      Application and analysis of optical techniques including optical                absorption, electromodulation (absorption, reflection,                          luminescence) and Raman scattering to study the formation and                   growth of crystallites in ultrathin films.  3) Application of                   Raman and optical techniques to study atomic diffusion in                       amorphous and nanocrystalline solids.  4) Development and                       application of optical and optical modulation techniques to study               quantum size effects, interface effects and the breakdown of                    crystal momentum selection rules in nanocrystals with well                      defined dimensions from 2nm to 20nm.  Nanostructured thin film                  materials will have a direct impact on the ability to develop                   amorphous thin films for large area applications such as photo-                 electronic detectors and arrays, field-effect display drivers and               photovoltaic devices.  Increased understanding of microscopic                   relaxation, diffusion and crystallization processes will have                   implications for the development of low temperature processing                  technologies for three-dimensional integrated circuits, high                    temperature semiconductors and non-linear optical components.",
