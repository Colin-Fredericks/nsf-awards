 "awd_abstract_narration": "This empirical research project is designed to explore the social               values and ethical implications posed by the creation of computer               programs designed to replicate human expertise.  The plan is to                 examine the values underlying this artificial intelligence                      technology by concentrating on ascertaining the professional and                social standards of desirability held by the knowledge engineers                who design and build these systems.  The methodology consists of                intensive and structured interviews especially designed to elicit               tacit values.  It is expected that the ensuing information will                 make a significant contribution to the forthcoming ethical                      deliberation as to the development and use of \"intelligent                      machines.\"  Initially, an advisory group composed of two                        philosophers and one social scientist will scrutinize the method                and results.  Two additional people, one lawyer and one person                  knowledgeable in this technology will also be consulted on the                  project.  The results will be disseminated to philosophers,                     computer scientists, social scientists, and lay audiences in                    papers and presentations.                                                                                                                                       This project addresses an important issue; the applicant and her                advisors are well qualified and she has unusual access to the                   population to be studied.  Collaborative efforts are likely to                  continue beyond the period of this award.  The project is                       designed well; university support and plans for the dissemination               of results are appropriate.  An award in the amount of $75,170 is               therefore recommended.",
