 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of a number of advanced engineering concepts is                 currently limited by the tribological problems which are experienced            by components and systems, when they are exposed to severe                      environments. Solutions to many of these problems lie in advanced               ceramic-ceramic composites with improved toughness and high                     temperature resistance.  The aim of this study is to develop the                basis for microstructural design of composites in this family of                materials for tribological and structural applications.  Initial work           will focus on the behavior under tribological conditions of titanium            aluminide matrix materials reinforced with continuous silicon carbide           fibers.  The wear and friction behavior will be related to the                  micromechanics of deformation and fracture which, in turn, will be              related to microstructural parameters and bulk mechanical properties.           The results will be used to develop a suitable model, which then will           be extended to other systems.",
