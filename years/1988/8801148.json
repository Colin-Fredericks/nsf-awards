 "awd_abstract_narration": "The photoprotein aequorin (initially isolated by the P.I. in                    1962) has been widely used as a Ca  -indicator in living cells.                 However, the preparations of aequorin used in the past were                     undefinable mixtures of isoaequorins containing impurities.                     Recently, two improved types of aequorin were prepared in the                   P.I.'s laboratory:  the first is pure isoaequorins consisting of                single molecular species, and the second is a semi-synthetic                    photoprotein designated e-aequorin in which the functional group                is modified.  The luminescence spectrum of e-aequorin shows two                 peaks (405 nm and 465 nm) and the ratio of the peak intensities                 is \u0131Ca  !-dependent in the pCa range of 5 - 7, thus allowing the                determination of Ca   concentration directly from the intensity                 ratio of the two peaks.                                                                                                                                         The primary objective of this project is to establish the                       advantage of using isoaequorins and e-aequorin in measuring                     intracellular Ca  , compared with other Ca  -indicators; this                   will be accomplished by the actual use of those materials by                    collaborating cell biologists.  Sufficient amounts of                           isoaequorins and e-aeqourin will be produced for this purpose                   and also to comply with requests from other investigators.  To                  increase the yields of more useful types of isoaequorins,                       interconversion between isoaequorins will be investigated.  The                 second objective is to prepare other useful forms of semi-                      synthetic aequorin which excel isoaequorins and e-aequorin; this                will be done by further modification of the functional group.",
