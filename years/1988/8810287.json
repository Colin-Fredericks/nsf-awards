 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is planned to investigate techniques for testing object-oriented             programs.  Object-oriented programming is a relatively new programming          methodology which has many attractive software engineering features.            While traditional programs are based on the paradigm of active                  procedures operating on passive data, object-oriented programming               employs the the paradigm of active data objects which perform                   operations on themselves.                                                                                                                                       To date, most research on software testing has focussed on traditional          programming languages.  The features of object-oriented programming             suggest several additional testing techniques, which may allow for more         effective testing.  This research will define several families of               testing techniques for object-oriented programs, build tools based on           some of these techniques, and investigate the cost and effectiveness of         the new techniques.",
