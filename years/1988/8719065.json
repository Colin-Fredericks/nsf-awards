 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research seeks to demonstrate two propositions: (1)People                  differ both in how they understand or think about the world                     (cognition), and the factual information in the world which they                pay attention to (perception).  For example, expert teachers may                differ from novice teachers both in the categories they use to                  interpret the same classroom observation (cognition) and in the                 kinds of classroom behaviors they pickup or are attuned to                      (perception).  (2) It is then assumed that a major determinant of               whether people are in a perceptual or cognitive mode (i.e. differ               in the things they see as well as how they see the same thing) is               the social setting in which their interpretations or observations               take place.                                                                                                                                                     Consider the example of a teacher who is told to communicate a                  general verbal impression of a student.  The demand to                          communicate under such conditions encourages the use of                         stereotype.like categories because it is easier to share these                  categories than it would be to describe a series of                             individualized perceptual reactions.  Alternatively, if a teacher               is told to develop a specific behavioral description of a                       student's problem behaviors, judgements are likely to be less                   stereotypic and more perceptually grounded.                                                                                                                     Other conditions which favor stereotypic impressions include                    being forced to make judgements about social interactive                        properties of people such as dominance, caring or cooperation,                  without the benefit of observing actual social interactions over                time (i.e. from second hand verbal information).  The research                  will attempt to show that the necessary information for                         judgements of traits such as dominance or competitiveness is                    directly observable in the amount or type of coordinations of                   actions that develop over time.  For example, in a cooperative                  relationship actions become increasingly coordinated, while in                  dominance, one person's actions may come to increasingly direct                 the others.                                                                                                                                                     The emphasis in this research is on the multiple roles played by                the social setting is in sharp counterpoint to most current                     cognitive work in social information processing which is overly                 verbal.  Moreover, it is claimed that investigating the                         conditions which encourage a sensitivity to social stimulus                     factors may be useful to both evaluation and training purposes in               regard to distinguishing between good and poor clinicians or                    expert versus novice teachers.  Such research may also serve to                 help explain and thus reduce the widespread use of stereotypic                  views of the world.",
