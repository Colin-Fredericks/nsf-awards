S. minority high              school students toward careers in engineering and the sciences.                 Participants will receive intensive training in mathematics, chemistry,         physics, computers, communications, and engineering science.  Students          will perform design work which require creative thinking and innovation         in arriving at a novel solution to a design problem.  Participants will         also visit area plant sites to experience the real world practice of            engineering and to meet with minority scientists and engineers employed         at those industries.  The underlying premise of the program is to               impart to the participants an understanding and an appreciation of the          analytical thought process and activities of the scientist-engineer.            Students entering grades 10-12 are eligible to apply.",
