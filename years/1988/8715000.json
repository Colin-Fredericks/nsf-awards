 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on theoretical, empirical and public policy issues                of technological standards in computing and communications is                   producing a growing body of important literature, a part of which               deals with understanding the process of standardization and the                 impact of standards on technological progress and economic                      efficiency.  This workshop seeks: to assess the contributions of                recent research in this area, from presentations of papers by                   representative leading researchers in economics and related                     disciplines; to facilitate and clarify examination of these issues                                                                                              by developing some basic conceptual and terminological guideposts               for this young research area; and to identify the most promising                theoretical and empirical research questions relevant to the                    policy issues surrounding standardization. The workshop will be                 limited to about 24 participants and will be held in mid-June,                  1988 at Stanford University.  The eleven papers presented at the                workshop will be reproduced as part of Stanford University's                    Center for Economic Policy Research's Discussion and Technical                  Paper Series.",
