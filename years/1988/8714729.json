 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to develop comprehensive, self-contained                  methods for mathematical analysis of the continuous casting process             for steel billets in the early stages of solidification.  The                   interaction of the heat transfer, freezing and stress development               process will be examined using three-dimensional finite element                 method techniques.  The principal novelty of this project is to                 iteratively determine the thermal and stress state of the casting by            examining the coupling between these two states.  This controls the             formation of an air gap between the mold and solidifying strand.                     The project represents a continuation and extension of earlier             work, which was restricted to round billets.  Accurate correlation              was found between computed results and experimental observations.               New research will focus upon three-dimensional effects,  especially             those associated with defect formation near corners of cast billets.",
