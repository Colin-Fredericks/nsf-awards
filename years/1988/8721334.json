 "awd_abstract_narration": "The grantee will conduct three workshops to examine data                needs and criteria for identification of scientific personnel in                three principal areas: the physical sciences, including                         mathematics and computer sciences; the life sciences; and the                   social and behavioral sciences. These workshops will lay the                    groundwork for the survey data collecting activities on                         scientific personnel during the decade of the 1990's by the                     National Science Foundation. The workshops, comprised of                        representatives from the professional societies, industry,                      academe and government, are essential to identifying important                  data issues and requirements for the inclusion of personnel in                  existing as well as newly-emerging scientific fields.                                   Information on the Nation's scientists and engineers (S/E's)            is developed by the National Science Foundation through its                     Scientific and Technical Personnel Data System (STPDS). This                    System provides numbers as well as demographic, educational,                    employment, and geographic characteristics of U.S. scientists and               engineers. These data are collected by three  major NSF biennial                surveys: the Survey of Doctorate Recipients; the National Survey                of Natural and Social Scientists and Engineers; and the Survey of               Recent Science and Engineering Graduates.",
