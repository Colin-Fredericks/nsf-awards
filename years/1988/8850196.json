 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 8-week summer residential Young Scholars Program will emphasize            research participation in the life sciences, biochemistry,                      physiological psychology, and some earth sciences such as paleontology.         To provide a broad perspective and a background for their research              participation, special advanced coursework will be provided during the          mornings of the first four weeks with research participation in the             afternoons.  The last four weeks will be devoted to full-time research          participation with occasional seminars in the evening.                                                                                                          The coursework will include:  lectures and discussions covering                 selected topics in modern cellular, molecular, evolutionary and                 developmental biology and biochemistry; readings and discussions of             great experiments in biology and biochemistry; and guest lectures by            research scientists.  Research participation will involve the student           as a junior member of a research team engaged in on-going research,             sometimes on a joint project with members of the team and sometimes on          an independent facet of a problem.  At the end of the program, the              participants will submit a written paper and will give oral                     presentations on their research at a two-day simulated professional             meeting.",
