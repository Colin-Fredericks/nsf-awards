 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bruenn will continue his theoretical work on the collapse and                   supernova explosion of a massive star.  Important are an improved               equation of state and better understanding of the role of                       neutrinos in sustaining the outward moving shock.  The result                   should be a reliable computation of the explosion all the way to                the time when the shock approaches the surface.                                                                                                                 The supernova explosion 1987A was unique not only because it was                relatively near and bright but also because it yielded a                        measurable flux of neutrinos, the elusive particles that inform us              of the deep interiors of the Sun and now of exploding stars.  Thus              it is now appropriate to improve the theories on the origin and                 effects of the neutrinos in exploding stars.  In particular, the                neutrinos may play an important role in sustaining the stellar                  explosion, which might otherwise falter unspectacularly.  Bruenn                is an expert in the relevant physics and will continue his                      modeling of the supernova explosion and its neutrinos.",
