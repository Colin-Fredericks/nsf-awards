 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports collaborative research on societal influences on            family patterns in China through use of probability sampling and                statistical analysis of data collected in the first two years of                this project.  The US investigator, Dr. Martin K. Whyte, University             of Michigan at Ann Arbor, will work with two Chinese sociologists at            Sichuan University to conduct extensive statistical analysis of data            collected in Chengdu, Sichuan, during the summer of 1987.                       Through use of the same data and same statistical software on                   microcomputers at both institutions  and through frequent exchange              of output and disks, the Chinese and American scientists will be                able to coordinate their comparative analysis.  Following analysis              of the data, efforts will be made to develop systematic comparisons             of Chinese and American family patterns.                                                                                                                        In addition to contributing to our understanding of the nature of               Chinese family structure and societal influences of that structure,             this project will serve to train students and faculty at Sichuan                University in survey research, family sociology, and related skills             and to facilitate the development of the discipline of sociology.               This will provide the basis for a more realistic awareness in both              societies about how the other society really operates and allow us              to make some informed decisions about our future relations with the             PRC.",
