 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposed project will further develop the concept of Evidence              Based Scheduling as a mechanism to efficiently utilize the                      communication and network resources of a real-time distributed                  message-based computer system.                                                                                                                                  Initially the project will enhance and refine the outline evidence              based scheduling mechanism developed at Worcester Polytechnic                   Institute.  A theoretical analysis of this scheduling mechanism will            be undertaken and its performance potential compared with existing              mechanisms such as those proposed by Stankovic (the Spring Project),            Blazewicz, and the work at Shin's Real-Time Computing Laboratory.  A            simulation of an autonomous mobile robot in an industrial environment           will then be used to verify the operation of the scheduling and focus-          of-attention mechanisms.                                                                                                                                        It is intended that this activity will demonstrate the potenital of             evidence based scheduling for real-time applications such as the                control of autonomous systems and enable the work to be brought to the          attention of the real-time research community by suitable                       publications.",
