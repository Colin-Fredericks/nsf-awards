 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is scarcely a subject in biogeochemistry which is                    more fundamental, yet so poorly understood, as the variability                  in atmospheric oxygen.  Oxygen is an essential element to                       global life cycles and is consumed by fossil fuel-burning                       and deforestation; yet the changes in the atmospheric oxygen                    concentration which must reflect these processes have never                     been detected.  The difficulty is simply that the appropriate                   technology has not been available for measuring the expected                    variations in oxygen against the large oxygen background of                     air.  Direct measurements of changes in oxygen would                            substantially improve the framework for studying the global                     carbon cycle and the perturbations due to human activities.                     Specifically, measuring the presumed long term rate of decline                  in oxygen would provide a basis for establishing the net annual                 global oxidation from which one could construct accurate                        figures for the net sources and sinks of carbon from fossil                     fuel burning and biospheric oxidation.  This would provide                      objective constraints on models of oceanic carbon dioxide                       uptake which are needed to forecast future carbon dioxide                       levels and future climate.  It would also provide a better                      basis for understanding whether today's elevated carbon dioxide                 levels are stimulating global net primary production.                                This project is designed to investigate the atmospheric                    oxygen and carbon dioxide fraction in air samples gathered from                 a series of stations around the world.  The purpose of those                    measurements is to correlate seasonal, latitudinal and secular                  trends in atmospheric carbon dioxide with variations in oxygen.                 These data will provide insights into changes in global                         biomass, and in ocean and land biological productivities.   Air                 samples will be taken in glass flasks and oxygen mole fraction                  will be referenced to compressed air standards using a recently                 developed interferometric oxygen analyzer.  The measurements                    will be accompanied by systematic studies of oxygen stability                   in glass flasks and high pressure cylinders.  Other work will                   include a laboratory feasibility study of obtaining                             cryogenically extracted air samples from the stratosphere for                   oxygen analysis, which would be of interest for determining                     recent oxygen depletion.",
