 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Multisensory Learning of the Lawrence Hall of Science,           with this Full Option Science System (FOSS), will provide, for grades 3-        6, a collection of multisensory, laboratory-based science activities.           Some of these will be products of new development, and some will be from        the 1986 FOSS Pilot project, which received National Science Foundation         funding.                                                                                                                                                        The FOSS Project will produce five products that will be developed with         the cooperation of Ohaus Scale Corporation, who will bring the FOSS             Program to the market after the third project year. The products will           include sixteen modules of laboratory activities; a Materials Assembly          Procedures document (to help teachers gather equipment for the                  activities); a set of correlation tables to assist with the integration         of FOSS activities into frameworks, with textbooks, and with other              hands-on resources; student laboratory equipment; and student worksheets        and instruction sheets.                                                                                                                                         Lawrence F. Lowery, the Principal Investigator, will have the support of        his Lawrence Hall of Science staff, and will work closely with local            school districts (including Mount Diablo and Vallejo Unified School             Districts), and with the nationally-established Ohaus Scale Corporation.                                                                                        Ohaus Scale Corporation and other participants in the project will              provide matching support in the amount of $2,396,395.                                                                                                           This proposal was submitted in response to the Program Solicitation,            \"Programs for Elementary School Science Instruction II,\" which                  encourages \"troika\" partnerships among publishers, school systems, and          scientists/science educators.",
