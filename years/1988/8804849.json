 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bacteria don't simply move randomly, but swwim toward                        favorable and away from unfavorable environments.  For example,                 certain chemicals (usually nutrients) attract them while others                 (usually noxious) repel them.  The phenomena of attraction and                  repulsion of bacteria by chemicals are known as positive and                    negative chemotaxis, respectively.  The occurrence of chemotaxis                implies that the organisms have one or more mechanisms for                      sensing chemicals as well as mechanisms for converting the                      sensory information into patterns of beating of their flagella,                 the organs responsible for their swimming behavior.  In this                    respect, bacterial chemotaxis is a model for chemical sensing                   (taste and smell) in higher organisms, in which chemicals in the                environment are detected in cells specialized to be able to                     respond to them.                                                                   This project is an attempt to develop an understanding of the                mechanisms by which sensory information is detected in bacterial                cells, and of the mechanism by which the activity of the                        flagellae is linked to this information.  The results will have                 relevance to understanding behavior and sensory detection in                    higher organisms as well as in bacteria, and will also contribute               to our knowledge of molecular biology of membranes and cell                     surface receptors in general.",
