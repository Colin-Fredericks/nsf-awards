The Center               will continue to disseminate hazards research information to                    potential users--administrators, technicians, policy makers, and                scientists.  The Center will publish and distribute the Natural                 Hazards Observer six times a year, continue its publication series,             and hold its annual workshop involving users and producers of                   hazards research.  The Center will provide information on a day-to-             day basis in response to inquiries.  The preparation and evaluation             of materials and assistance to other groups in the development of               new programs and information will complete the Center's main                    responsibilities.  Particular emphasis will be placed on developing             lines of communication with groups not previously active in the                 hazards field to increase their awareness and to stimulate efforts to           mitigate hazard impacts on their own facilities and in their own                communities.  Modest research activities will also be conducted  at             the Center and the Center will support researchers throughout the               nation as they carry out \"quick response\" research on specific                  hazard events.",
