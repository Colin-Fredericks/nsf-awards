 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most controversial questions in sexual selection             is what causes the evolution of female preference for certain                   male characteristics.  Although these traits often seem                         arbitrary, it is usually assumed that the evolution of male                     traits can be explained by female preference for greater and                    greater development of those characters.  However, it is not                    clear what benefits females obtain from choosing males with these               traits.  The two competing hypotheses are (1) that selective                    females produce male offspring that are also attractive to                      females or (2) that selective females obtain mates that                         contribute superior resources or superior genetic qualities to                  their offspring.  The Trinidad guppy presents a unique                          opportunity to determine the natural selection payoffs that                     selective females obtain, because this species lives in areas                   with high and low levels of predation.  This should produce                     variation in natural selection payoffs that will cause                          differences in female preference for exaggerated male characters                important in determining predation risk.  This will be the first                study to use variation in natural selection, laboratory selection               experiments, and breeding designs to determine how female                       preference and male traits coevolve by the process of sexual                    selection.",
