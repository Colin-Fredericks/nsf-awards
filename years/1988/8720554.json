 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to conduct a detailed rock magnetic and                  finite strain study to determine whether rock strain during                     folding is typically of the correct magnitude and geometry to                   rotate a prefolding magnetization into a synfolding                             configuration.  The effects of layer parallel simple shear strain               on remanence-carrying grains will be investigated through field                 investigations and laboratory modeling experiments.  In the field               component of this project, the PI will study the finite strain                  and remanence in several mid-Paleozoic Appalachian clastic rocks                from the Valley and Ridge Province which are known to carry                     stable signals (eg. Bloomsburg Formation, Juniata Formation, Rose               Hill Formation).  The finite strain of some of these rocks has                  been studied (eg. green reduction spots in the Bloomsburg                       Formation).  The results of these studies will be extended by the               investigation of progressive, noncoaxial deformation recorded by                syntectonic pressure fibers around rigid grains and/or in                       syntectonic extension veins.  Sampling schemes will be designed                 to compare the remanence in strained and unstrained rocks to                    detect rotation of remanence.  In the laboratory component of                   this study, the PI will deform a synthetic magnetic sediment by                 simple shear strain to determine the effects of a well-                         controlled, constant volume, noncoaxial deformation on remanence-               carrying grains.",
