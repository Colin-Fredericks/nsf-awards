 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will explore a new etching technique called aerosol jet           etching for use in integrated circuit manufacture.  In this technique,          submicron droplets of etchant freshly formed from the vapor state are           deposited on the substrate to be etched.  The etching of silicon with           hydrofluoric - nitric acid droplets and the etching of gallium                  arsenide with bromine - ethanol droplets will be studied                        experimentally.  Attention will be directed to the anisotropy of                etching and the level of resolution achievable.  Parts of the process           will be modelled mathematically.  The research will also explore the            use of electrically charged clusters consisting of several thousand             etchant molecules as a hybrid of aerosol jet etching and focussed ion           beam etching in order to achieve very high resolution.                                                                                                          Aerosol jet etching combines several advantages of wet and dry etching          while avoiding some of their respective disadvantages.  In particular,          very small contamination, good anisotropy of etching, and adequate              line width resolution are achievable.  Use of charged clusters                  promises to achieve even finer line width resolution.",
