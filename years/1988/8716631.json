 "awd_abstract_narration": "Considerable research effort in the past few years has                     clarified substantially the understanding of magnetospheric                     plasma physics.  These advances to be made through combined                     efforts of three research approaches: in situ observations,                     theoretical/computational efforts, and laboratory simulations of                relevant plasma physics.  The work at the University of                         California at Irvine centers on laboratory simulations; the                     Irvine effort centers on their ability to study plasmas and their               ion distribution functions with excellent temporal and spatial                  resolution, thereby allowing careful study of ion responses to                  static and radio frequency wave fields which are under the                      experimenter's control.  This grant will continue a laboratory                  study of mechanisms which could contribute to the formation of                  the magnetospheric plasma, radio frequency heating mechanisms                   which could create ion conic distributions in the polar                         magnetosphere, combined radio frequency and quasi-static field                  mechanisms, and charged particle beam formation which could lead                to ion conics.                                                                       Overall, the aim is to study processes by which the                        ionosphere can supply plasma to the magnetosphere.  It is now                   believed that the ionosphere is a major contributor to the                      magnetosphere.",
