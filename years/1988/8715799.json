 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is directed towards an eventual understanding                     of the metabolic regulation of the polyamine pathway and the                    genes encoding the enzymes of the pathway in Nicotiana                          (tobacco).  Molecular probes (antibodies or cDNA clones) will                   be obtained for 3 of the enzymes of the pathway:  ornithine,                    arginine, and SAM decarboxylases.  The methods used will be                     standard protein purification and antibody production,                          coupled with the possible use of heterologous probes for some                   enzymes that have been cloned from mammalian systems.  These                    probes will be used to study the regulation of the pathway by                   polyamines and by environmental factors.  Tobacco cell                          cultures are a favorable system because they can grow on a                      minimal defined medium, and also be regenerated into whole                      plants.  This research will also examine the genomic DNA                        corresponding to any cDNA clones, as examples of genes                          encoding metabolic enzymes, a category of plant genes that are                  relatively understudied.                                                                                                                                        The proposed research is important to an understanding of how                   polyamines affect plant growth.  Polyamines are thought to be                   involved in a number of important aspects of plant growth                       including flower development (the subject of this proposal),                    seed formation, senescence (plant death) and many aspects of                    plant responses to stress (salt, drought, pathogens).***//",
