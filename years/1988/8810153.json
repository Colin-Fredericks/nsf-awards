 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this one-day symposium is to bring together a                  diverse and multidisciplinary group of scientists, all of whom                  are actively investigating the role of parasite infection as a                  driving force in sexual selection.  'Sexual selection' is the                   term used by biologists to refer to changes in gene frequencies                 resulting from competition among members of one sex for mates.                  Specifically, research to be presented in this symposium is aimed               at assessing the extent to which variation among individual                     traits evaluated during mate choice accurately reflects variation               among those same individuals in resistance to parasite infection                and disease.                                                                         Sexual selection is known to have been of great importance                 in shaping the physiology, morphology and behavior of a wide                    range of vertebrate species, including humans; hence this very                  basic genetic process is of considerable interest in its own                    right.  However, the research to be presented in this symposium                 is also likely to contribute to our understanding of other                      equally important genetic and behavioral process, most especially               processes affecting the transmission (and control) of parasites                 and disease among both humans and animals.  Hence, from the                     standpoint of human welfare the value of the proposed symposium                 may lie in its contribution to the emerging synthesis of                        epidemiology with the closely-related disciplines of population                 genetics and behavioral ecology.                                                     The proposed symposium will be held in conjunction with the                1988 meetings of the American Society of Zoologists (ASZ) and                   will provide the first opportunity for behavioral ecologists                    involved in research on sexual selection to interact with                       parasitologists and other scientists knowledgeable about host-                  parasite coevolution.  It is anticipated that papers presented in               the symposium will be published in the American Zoologist or                    other appropriate outlet, thereby making results of the symposium               accessible to a larger audience than simply those individuals                   attending the 1988 ASZ meetings.",
