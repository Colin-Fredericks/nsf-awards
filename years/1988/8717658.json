 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid decline of diffusion coefficients in supersaturated                   solutions is examined in terms of the formation of molecular clusters.          Preliminary experimental work has shown that diffusion coefficients in          metastable supersaturated solutions vary with the \"age\" of the                  solution.  In this work, the investigators experimentally examine the           diffusion coefficients of supersaturated solutions made from solid              nonelectrolyte and  solvent as a function of solution \"history\" and             \"age.\"  The experimental results is compared to theoretical                     predictions based on theories of cluster evolution and cluster                  diffusion in metastable solutions.                                                                                                                              Transport properties of low molecular weight (non-polymer) solutions            are usually considered to be functions of variables such as                     concentration and temperature.  Normally, the temperature \"history\",            physical treatment, or \"age\" of a solution have not been thought to             affect the properties of such a solution.  Metastable solutions,                however, present the novel situation where \"history\" and \"age\" could            be used to alter properties of a solution such as the diffusion                 coefficient.  Understanding the role of \"history\" and \"age\" on cluster          formation and the diffusion coefficient could lead to innovative                methods for crystallizer design and innovative new separation                   techniques.",
