 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides the first of four expected years of support.                Dr.Jorde and his colleagues will conduct genetic studies on a                   sample of 400 Utah Mormons born in 8 different geographic                       subdivisions. Dr. Jorde will obtain restriction fragment length                 polymorphisms (RFLPs) from three different genomic sources:                     mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), Y chromosomal DNA and autosomal DNA.                 The first is inherited maternally, the second only through the                  paternal line the the third from both parents. Hypotheses will be               tested regarding levels of polymorphism, between-group genetic                  variance andd genetic distances using these three types of RFLPs.               Given the excellent documentation maintained by the Mormon church               it will also be possible to compare genetic kinship based on                    RFLPs with previously obtained estimates of kinship based on                    migration matrices, isonoymy (shared last names) and pedigree                   data. This will allow several evolutionary hypotheses to be                     tested. Theory, for example, predicts that Y chromosomal DNA and                mtDNA RFLPs should be especialy sensitive indicators of founder                 effects and drift. If this is true, then genetic distances                      calculated using these systems should be comparatively larger                   than those based on autosomal DNA for smaller outlying                          subdivisions.                                                                                                                                                   This project is important because it will help to develop a                     technique which is of great potential use in anthropological as                 well as other types of genetic study. Because the genetics of                   mtDNA and Y chromosomal DNA are simple - each inherited from only               one parent - and because both kinds of DNA appear to mutate                     quickly, both potentially provide excellent population markers                  which can be used to trace the migration and physical interaction               of groups over time. Through study of present day groups it                     should be possible to reconstruct their history. Because of this                recognized potential, mtDNA has already been used for this                      purpose but the results are controversial since basic studies in                controlled situations have not been conducted. Dr. Jorde's                      project should remedy this situation. The results of this                       research will be of value not only to anthropologists and                       historians but also to geneticists and other biologists.",
