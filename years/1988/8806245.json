 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides equipment to support research projects related            to problems of noise and vibration control.  The equipment comprises            a GenRad 2515 Computer-Aided Test System and related testing analysis           software.  Its capabilities include modal analysis, signal analysis,            acoustic intensity measurements, and rotating machinery testing.  Two           current projects will utilize the equipment.  The first is entitled             Measurement Based Models for Acoustic Response.  The project is                 directed towards the control of noise in machines, transportation               vehicles, and the workspace.  It requires experimental multi channel            signal processing and analysis to facilitate the accurate analytical            modeling of a sound field and its sources.  The procedure decomposes            the sound field into its propagating energy bearing portion and the             standing wave reactive portion.  The second project is entitled                 Structural Acoustic Modal Analysis.  Its focus will be the vibration            of structures and machines, and their acoustic radiation.  An                   experimental modal analysis is conducted to obtain a mechanical                 system's modal properties, natural frequencies, mode shapes, and                damping characteristics.  Furthermore, the surface acoustic intensity           field is also measured with the equipment.  These measurements are              used to define the dynamic response and the sound radiation resulting           from each mode of the structural response.  Structural modifications            using optimization techniques are applied to the model to predict new           structural and acoustic responses and to                                        assist in the structure/acoustics design process.",
