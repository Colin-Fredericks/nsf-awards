 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal defines a program of research,                               experimentation, technology development, and demonstrations                     leading to the creation of a national scale data communications                 network with  transmission speeds in excess of a gigabit per                    second (1 Gb/s).  Specific products of the overall project are                  the development and demonstration of long-haul networking at                    speeds greater than 100 megabits per second, and specification of               the additional architectural development including protocols,                   switching fabrics, and fiber-optic transmission facilities for                  the gigabit network.                                                                 This proposal may be thought of as the first phase of a                    multi-phase plan extending over several years.  During this first               phase the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI)                  will issue a call for white papers, evaluate the responses, hold                numerous working group meetings, and working with the                           subcontractors develop/select an architectural approach for a                   very high speed network.                                                             The approach involves CNRI coordinating the efforts of                     industrial and academic participants, with very substantial                     cost-sharing by the private sector.  At the end of this phase a                 detailed proposal will be produced along with a set of specific                 subcontrator tasks to be accomplished.",
