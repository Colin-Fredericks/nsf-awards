 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on the importance and mechanisms of ecological                 interactions, as exemplified in subtropical island ecosystems                   will be continued.  An experiment with lizards, web spiders,                    both, or neither removed from large enclosures will determine the               separate effects of lizards and spiders on ambient insects and                  foliage damage, as well as whether an increase in spiders                       compensates for lizard removal.  How lizards reduce prey                        consumption by spiders will be determined by monitoring prey in                 traps, prey in webs and prey actually consumed; by observing                    diurnal versus nocturnal consumption; and by testing whether                    spiders use more productive sites in no-lizard enclosures.  Food                levels in natural webs will be raised to those of no-lizard                     enclosures to see the effect on spider fecundity.  Lizards will                 be introduced onto no-lizard islets to measure effects on ambient               insects and foliage damage, and by comparison with adjacent                     lizard islands, tests will be made of whether the experiment can                eventually mimic the natural situation.  About 250 spider and                   about 35 lizard populations will be monitored on over 100 islands               to determine causes of extinction, long-term population stability               and results of ongoing competition experiments.  An overall                     premise is the use of islands as a model for understanding                      community and ecosystem processes.",
