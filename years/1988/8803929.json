 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Electronics Education Foundation of the American Electronics                Association has established a unique program providing                          opportunities for U.S. engineering and computer science students                to conduct research in major industrial research laboratories in                Japan.  The long-term goal of this AEA Japan Research Fellowhip                 Program is to increase the pool of American engineers familiar                  with Japan.                                                                                                                                                     This award will allow two groups of students (20-25 fellows) to                 participate in nine-week intensive Japanese language training                   during the summer prior to their departure for Japan.  Past                     experience suggests that language competency determines, to a                   large extent, the depth of technical and cultural interaction                   possible and the degree to which the visiting researcher is                     integrated into the Japanese host laboratory.  The support, to be               jointly funded with AEA, will be used to develop and deliver a                  course of Japanese language study tailored to the technical                     student with an immediate need for survival-level Japanese                      language skills and as a basis for continued formal training in                 Japan.",
