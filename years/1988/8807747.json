 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aims of this research are the creation of new surface                  forms and the determination of geometric properties of                          surfaces.  More particularly, under the first topic, rational                   curve and surface schemes will be developed and studied.                        Rational B-spline curves and surfaces are becoming the industry                 standard for Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Manufacturing                 information.  Moreover, although polynomial B-spline curves and                 surfaces have been studied for some time, their rational                        counterparts have received considerably less attention,                         particularly in connection with design.  Thus there are both                    scientific and application motivations for studying this class                  of curves and surfaces.                                                              The determination of geometric properties of surfaces is                   called \"Geometry Processing.\"  For an already constructed curve                 or surface, geometric properties may be desired to understand                   the surface better or the geometric property may itself be                      desired for an application.  Examples of geometric properties                   which help explain a surface are curvatures and reflection                      lines.  Geometric properties of interest per se include                         surface/surface intersections, offset surfaces, and surfaces on                 surfaces.                                                                            The full sweep from constructive mathematics through the                   implementation of algorithms and the interactive computer                       graphics display of surfaces is utilized in this research.",
