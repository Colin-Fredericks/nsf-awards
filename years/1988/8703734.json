 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research Dr. Etkin will conduct a follow up study in a                  rural Hausa village in Nigeria. As a medical anthropologist,                    Dr. Etkin is interested in the relationship between culture and                 disease and she will determine how these have changed in the last               ten years. Over this decade, several things have happened. The                  establishment of a local government clinic has facilitated access               to Western medical care. Secondly, over this same span of time                  the Hausa community has become increasingly integrated into the                 national economy. Finally local agricultural development projects               have not only affected diet but also the environment and the                    availability of local wild plant resources. Traditionally the                   Hausa incorporated these resources into their diet and believed                 they had medicinal properties, including the ability to prevent                 malaria, which is endemic to this region.                                                                                                                       During a year of planned fieldwork, Dr. Etkin will interview                    residents and focus on continuity and change in use of indigenous               medicines. She will conduct field surveys to document available                 plant resources. A dietary survey will also be administered in                  conjunction with a broad-based questionnaire on food                            availability, selection and preparation. Clinic records will be                 examined and malaria screening conducted in conjunction with                    clinic personnel. Dr. Etkin will also collect plants to be tested               for potential anti-malarial activity in a second laboratory phase               of the project.                                                                                                                                                 This research is important because it examines how human health                 is influenced by the complex interrelationships among such                      biological and cultural variables as infectious                                 disease, indigenous and Western medicines, diet and agriculture.                The United States provides aid to third world countries to                      improve physical health and this research will contribute to its                effective use.",
