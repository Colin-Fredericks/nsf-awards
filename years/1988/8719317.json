 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports development of a series of in vitro models                of the glycogenolytic complex with increasing degree of                         organization.  The models will be based on the known interactions               of the enzymes involved in the regulation of glycogenolysis.  The               models will be expressed mathematically and experimentally tested               using assemblies of purified enzymes and other cellular                         components.  Models to be tested are mixtures of phosphorylase                  kinase and phosphatase; this mixture of enzymes with added                      regulatory proteins, and complexes of enzymes with particulate                  glycogen.  The models will be evaluated for sensitivity                         amplification to the signals of effectors, energy consumption of                regulatory processes, and their relationship to glycogen                        particles isolated from muscle which contain the enzymes of                     glycogen metabolism and regulation.                                                                                                                             Glycogen is the storage site for sugar in the liver and muscle.                 Breakdown of glycogen provides energy for activity and metabolism               and regulates blood sugar levels.  Biochemists study glycogen                   breakdown because it illustrates several important principles.                  It occurs by more than one pathway, it is hormonally regulated,                 and defects lead to human diseases.  Current dogma holds that                   glycogen particles are not multi-enzyme complexes, i.e., have                   enzymes present in specified ratios.  This project uses                         experimental and mathematic means to test this idea.",
