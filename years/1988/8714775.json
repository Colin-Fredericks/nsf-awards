 "awd_abstract_narration": "The enzyme subtilisin will be studied in order to understand                    the nature of enzyme binding and catalysis, an area of                          importance both to biology and chemistry.  This enzyme is an                    ideal system for such a study because the x-ray structure is                    known to high resolution and, more importantly, many crystal                    structures of mutant variants have been and are being solved.                   The mechanism of action is clear and the effects of changes                     in the primary structures on both binding and catalysis have                    been analyzed separately.  Other enzymes have been studied                      with site specific mutagenesis, but none have the combination                   of excellent and abundant crystal structures and this wide                      variety of binding and catalytic mutant variants that subtilisin                does.                                                                                                                                                           New insights into the details of serine protease catalysis                      should be realized.  This should also catalyze the                              development and refinement of theoretical methods for                           studying binding and catalysis in many other macromolecular                     molecules as well as in enzymes.***",
