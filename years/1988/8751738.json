 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year project will develop materials to prepare middle and high         school mathematics teachers to teach statistics and will use these              materials in a five-week summer session for 30 teachers from the region         around Oxford, Ohio.  Designed as a supplement to standard college-level        statistics texts, these materials will offer, at an adult level, the            kinds of experiential approach to statistics that is currently                  emphasized in many secondary school texts.  The five modules will cover         descriptive statistics and data analysis, elementary probability,               probability distributions, elementary inference, and advanced inference.                                                                                        Follow-up activities include visits by project staff to the                     participants' schools and a miniconference at the end of the academic           year.  Evaluation will assess the effectiveness of the materials, as            well as the participants' success in teaching statistics in their               schools.  The materials will be disseminated through a series of                regional workshops.                                                                                                                                             The university and the participants' schools will contribute an amount          equal to 26% of the NSF award.",
