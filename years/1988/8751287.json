 "awd_abstract_narration": "The middle school years are critical in determining a student's success         and continued participation in mathematics.  This proposal involves the         expansion of MESA (Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement) model         to the junior high/middle school population in the State of Washington.         The project will focus on updating and revitalizing middle school               mathematics curriculum, the goal being to increase minority student             enrollment in algebra in the ninth grade.  The MESA model also                  recognizes the need for teacher support and provides teacher seminars on        a regular basis.  Additionally, the expansion of the statewide Pre-             College Center at the University of Washington will include the                 coordination of a statewide program at the junior high/middle school            level.                                                                                                                                                          The MESA model is based on a partnership between industry and                   educators--a cooperative effort involving scientists on loan from               industry, educators at the university level and educators at the                secondary school levels working together to develop curricula that will         stimulate student interest and achievement in mathematics and science.          The staff for the project is well qualified with experience in the MESA         program and in curriculum development and teacher training.                                                                                                     The proposal addresses a clear need for improving minority mathematics          education in middle/junior high schools and promises to have an impact          throughout the nation for all students by serving as a model academic           program.  The project goals are consistent with the Instructional               Materials guidelines.  Therefore, an award is recommended.",
