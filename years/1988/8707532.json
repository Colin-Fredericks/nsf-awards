 "awd_abstract_narration": "A physical understanding of the dynamics of stick-slip                     instability as an analogue of earthquake rupture is of                          fundamental importance to earthquake mechanics.  To this end,                   laboratory studies on rock friction can provide crucial data on                 the friction constitutive relation and the instability                          behavior.  Recent researches have focussed on the determination                 of parameters for a class of rate and state dependent friction                  law in the stable sliding stage.  Nonlinear stability analysis                  and computer simulation reveal a wide range of oscillational                    and dynamic instability behavior, some of which have never been                 observed and some of which have not been systematically studied                 in the laboratory.  The PI will investigate the velocity                        dependence of such behavior using a triaxial system with an                     internal transducer assembly at high normal stress as a test of                 the theory.  Selected tests at elevated temperatures are also                   planned.",
