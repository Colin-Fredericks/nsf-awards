 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ten evolutionary biologists and ten philosophers of biology                     will meet for one week to discuss issues in the foundations                     of evolutionary biology.  The conference will be broken into                    ten sessions, each dealing with a particular topic.  No                         papers will be presented.  Instead, a biologist and a                           philosopher will be assigned to a particular topic and asked                    to prepare position papers to be distributed in advance of                      the conference.  Each session will then be led by these two.                    All biologists to be invited are aware of the foundational                      problems in their science, and all philosophers to be                           invited are aware of the empirical warrant for present-day                      scientific theories.   Differences between the two groups                       tend to be in training and emphasis.  The purpose of bringing                   these philosophers and biologists together is to promote the                    interdisciplinary investigation of the fundamental issues                       confronting evolutionary biology today.",
