 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is an Accomplishment Based Renewal.  Previous research by            the principal investigator has established the conditions under which           cooperation can get started and maintain itself in simple environments.         The environments previously examined include the two-person Prisoner's          Dilemma, and an n-person norms game.  In the last five years, this work         has seen numerous applications to international political economy,              antitrust law, government regulation, economic theory, artificial               intelligence, and other fields.                                                                                                                                 The current research investigates how collective properties (such as            cooperation or conflict) emerge from the actions of individuals who             adapt to each other within a complex population structure.  The method          is to develop a series of parallel adaptive models of whole                     populations.  The models will be parallel in that all the individuals           will be active at one time.  The models will be adaptive in that the            individuals will adjust their behavior, in light of their own goals, to         the effects that they are experiencing from others.  Rather than assume         that the adjustment process is based upon rational calculation, the             investigator will assume it is based upon learning from experience or           differential survival of relatively successful strategies.                                                                                                      This research is important for the social sciences because standard             theoretical and mathematical approaches have traditionally assumed that         only one or two things are happening at a time.  In politics and                society a great many events occur at once.  Im particular, many people          make interdependent choices that influence each other's environments.           Thus an understanding of parallel adaptive models has the potential to          enhance our insight into a wide variety of political processes such as:         political leadership, public participation, domestic influences on              foreign policy, regime formation in international political economy,            and alliance politics in international security affairs.  While this            project may not provide definitive treatments of any one of these               areas, it promises to promote the appreciation of certain features that         are common to all of them.",
