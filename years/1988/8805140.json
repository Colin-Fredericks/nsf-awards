 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            designed to increase the participation of minorities in scientific and          engineering research.  The program provides support to strengthen the           research environments and capabilities of institutions that have                substantial minority student enrollments.  Eligible institutions must           also have graduate programs in science or programs in engineering.              Researchers at Lehman College will use RIMI support to acquire                  instrumentation to establish a central facility for research in                 molecular biology.  Investigators in the Department of Biological               Science and Chemistry will use the requested equipment to perform               research on the analysis of multiple two-dimensional protein gels,              analyzing and sequencing of DNA molecules, and conducting                       chromatographic separation of chemical solutions.  These studies will           increase the institution's capability to examine the regulation,                structure, and function of large biological molecules.                                                                                                          This project on molecular biology will strengthen the research                  infrastructure of an urban university that trains significant numbers           of minority scientists.  The principal investigator has a very strong           background in biochemistry and molecular biology.  She publishes in             refereed journals and collaborates with excellent investigators in              this area.  This award will provide opportunities for more minority             students to engage in meritorious biological research.",
