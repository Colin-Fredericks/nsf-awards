The TDEM (time                    domain electromagnetic method) system is a deep-water                           adaptation of a similar instrument that was successfully                        tested in shallow water and one that has been employed in                       terrestrial studies.  The system will be towed across the                       seafloor to continuously map the electrical conductivity of                     the underlying sediment and rock.  A switched magnetic source                   generates a signal which diffuses through the seafloor rocks                    and is detected by magnetometers towed a fixed distances                        behind the source.  Modifications in the detected signal from                   the source signal that are brought about by differing                           properties of underlying rocks, provides an estimate of                         electrical conductivity as a function of depth.  Information                    may then be inferred about sub-seafloor hydrothermal                            circulation, sulfide ore deposits, sedimentation rates, and                     other geological features.  Features may be measured as far                     as a few hundred meters beneath the seafloor and                                electromagnetic measurements are independent from those                         provided by seismic or sonar surveys.",
