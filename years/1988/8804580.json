 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for a mathematical                         conference to be held at the University of Arizona in January                   1989.  The purpose of this meeting is to bring together experts                 in the field of complex analysis to present and discuss ways in                 which computers are affecting research in this field.                                The conference will be international in scope combining both               theoreticians and computational experts.  The need for this                     gathering has arisen, as in many other areas of mathematics,                    because of the sharp impact computing has made on attitudes of                  researchers and their approaches to solving long-standing                       problems.  Examples of phenomena in complex analysis which could                not be analyzed by hand have been worked out.  New insights,                    conjectures and, eventually, new theorems have resulted.  In                    addition, computers have created a demand for new methods which                 would have been of no use in precomputer days.                                       Intense activity in numerous locations has led to research                 aimed at solving similar problems from different computational                  points of view.  This is particularly noticeable in the area of                 conformal mapping where improved techniques lead to immediate                   application in grid approximations to problems in partial                       differential equations.  It is vital that groups such as these be               brought together to compare their accomplishments and to                        introduce others to computation as a valuable tool which can make               important contributions to their fundamental research.",
