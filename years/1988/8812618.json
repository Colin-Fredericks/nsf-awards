 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research proposal concerns the designs of nonswitching                     controllers for systems with multiple operation conditions.  These              multi-mode control systems occur in many practical systems, such as             aircraft, automobiles and power systems.  A nonswitching controller             can potentially reduce costs and improve performance compared to the            commonly used gain switching controllers.  The design approach in this          proposal will be based on a recently developed novel multi-model                controller design approach built on multivariable state space                   techniques.  The focus here is to investigate the performance                   optimization aspect of systems with multiple operating conditions.  A           main motivation is that the problem formulation would allow the                 construction of a procedure for the computation of simultaneous                 stabilizing controls.",
