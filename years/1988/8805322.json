It is for the purchase of special                     purpose equipment dedicated to the support of research in the                   mathematical sciences.  In general, this equipment is required by               several research projects, and would be difficult to justify for                one project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation                is coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers,                 and with substantial cost-sharing from the institution submitting               the proposal.  This is an instance of university, industrial, and               government cooperation in the support of basic research in the                  mathematical sciences.                                                               The equipment in this project will be used for the following               mathematical research project to be carried out in the                          mathematics department of Ohio State University: Coherence and                  Chaos in near Integrable Partial Differential Equations;                        Qualitative Properties of Solutions to the unsteady Prandtl                     Boundary Layer Equations near the Point of Separation; Stability                of Travelling Wave Solutions Arising from Systems of Reaction-                  diffusion Equations; and Hausdorff Dimension, and other Fractal                 Dimensions, of Non-self-similar Sets.",
