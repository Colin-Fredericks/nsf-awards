 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Michael Freeling and his colleagues at the University of               California at Berkeley will establish a Biological Research Center for          Plant Developmental Biology.  The center will provide salaries and              supplies for two technicians and up to five graduate students, funds            for a seminar program and modest funds for research to be performed in          the center members' own laboratories.  The technicians will develop new         techniques and train others in their use.  Individual research programs         will include studies of development of the corn leaf ligule, the role           of cytoplasmic structure in corn microsporogenesis, microbe-plant               interactions, root growth, embryogenesis by cultured cells, the                 regulation of development by ethylene, and other aspects of plant gene          regulation.  Travel funds will be used to support attendance at                 scientific meetings by students and to bring approximately five outside         speakers a year to lecture on aspects of plant development.  An annual          center retreat is also planned.  The center's equipment and technical           staff will be housed in a single large laboratory in a new Plant                Biology Building currently under construction.                                       This center, unique in its size and goals, will emphasize the              application of modern and classical techniques of genetics and cell             biology to understanding the development of a variety of specialized            cells in corn and other plants.  The research will address questions            which are unique to plant systems, or for which plants provide                  particularly useful experimental models.  Among others, these include           the study of the development of the leaf and of pollen.  An important           focus of the center will be a training program that will support the            recruitment and training of graduate students and a seminar series.             Besides increasing the depth and sophistication of our understanding of         plant development, the center should play an significant role in                training a new generation of plant researchers in an area of emerging           importance.",
