 "awd_abstract_narration": "The evolution of plant populations can be affected by                      natural selection, gene flow (genes entering the population from                other populations), and genetic drift (chance events due to small               population size).  In order to understand how evolution proceeds,               one must know how these different forces operate together.  All                 of these are affected by which individuals are transmitting genes               to the next generation.  However, because movement of pollen from               plant to plant is nearly impossible to follow, determination of                 which individuals are supplying genes is difficult.                                  The technique of electrophoresis makes it possible to                      determine if a given individual could be the father of a                        particular seed.  By applying this technique to seeds produced by               all individuals in a population, a determination of which                       individuals are supplying genes to progeny can be made.                              Knowing the parentage of seeds will help explain how                       different forces affect the evolution of a population.  In                      addition, information on how genes move through a population can                be applied to agricultural systems.  This informaton could be                   very beneficial when breeding for specific traits or when trying                to reduce the amount of gene movement into or out of a particular               area.",
