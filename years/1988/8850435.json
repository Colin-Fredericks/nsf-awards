 "awd_abstract_narration": "Twenty-five Junior High School science teachers from the Central                Alabama area will be selected to participate in a project designed to           give them practical laboratory experience and update their chemistry            background.  The chemical activities will be patterned after those in           Chemical Activities, a recent publication from the American Chemical            Society.  This program consists of over 100 chemical and physical               science activities suitable for junior high students.  It has also been         approved by a safety committee of the ACS for student use.                                                                                                      The primary objective is to give this group of teachers suitable                background in the appropriate chemical topics in order to implement             these activities in their classrooms and laboratories.                          Application of chemistry to social and environmental issues will be             stressed and activities that relate chemistry to everyday life will be          emphasized.                                                                                                                                                     An instructional format of monthly two-day sessions followed by a               week-long summer session will be used.  Extensive follow-up activities          are planned with visits to participants' schools by project staff and at        least two regional day-long conferences in which participants will share        their experiences.                                                                                                                                              The University of Alabama and the participating school districts                are contributing the equivalent of 10% of the NSF grant.",
