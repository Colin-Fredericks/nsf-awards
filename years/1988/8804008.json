Projects in biochemistry and cell biology will be directed by                   full-time faculty members, actively engaged in research and                     experienced in undergraduate education.  Ten students will                      participate in research that focuses on the molecular and                       cellular processes of intracellular movement, metabolism,                       neurotransmission, cell differentiation, vertebrate development,                intracellular information transfer, genetic controls, and cancer                control.  In the laboratory students will gain experience in cell               and tissue culture, disc and slab gel electrophoresis, various                  types of chromatography, preparative centrifugation, UV-visible                 spectrophotometry, recombinant DNA technology, electron                         microscopy, and protein purification.  Through seminars they                    will become acquainted with broad areas of biological research.                 The participants will be active members of a research team and                  increasingly independent researchers.                                                                                                                           Participants will be selected by a committee made up of the                     Project Director and two biological science faculty members of                  the University.  Selection will be based upon the students'                     academic records in the natural sciences and upon their aptitude                and interest in research.  Participants will be assigned advisers               according to their interests and in consultation with the faculty               members involved.",
