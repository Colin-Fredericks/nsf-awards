This project is at the forefront of an area with the potential                  to benefit society in numerous ways:  catalysis, optical and                    electro-optical devices and photoconversion of energy.                                                                                                          The proposed research program is a three-fold investigation of                  the electronic excited states of organometallic compounds,                      especially metal carbene, carbyne, olefin and nitrosyl                          compounds.  The first group of experiments is the assignment of                 excited states by using single crystal polarized spectroscopy.                  New experimental techniques make it possible to measure                         absorption bands with high extinction coefficients of oriented                  molecules in crystals at low temperatures.  Detailed                            assignments will be made.  Vibronic structure, when present,                    will be used to determine the excited state distortions.  An                    additional result is the quantitative experimental measurement                  of metal-ligand sigma and pi interactions which will be                         compared with both ligand field and molecular orbital theory.                   The second component of the program is the determination of                     excited state distortions by using a combination of                             pre-resonance Raman spectra, electronic spectra and                             time-dependent theory.  This combination makes it possible to                   calculate the magnitudes of all of the distortions along normal                 modes in the excited state potential hypersurface.  The third                   group of experiments is the measurement of geometries of                        molecules in excited electronic states by using excited state                   pump-probe Raman spectroscopy.  In these experiments, excited                   states are produced by absorption of one photon and the                         vibrational spectrum of the molecule in this excited state is                   measured by Raman spectroscopy with a second photon.  This                      method is complementary to the above techniques and will be                     especially useful for studying extremely large distortions and                  metastable intermediates.  The goal of the three groups of                      experiments is the unified understanding of excited state                       obital characteristics, potential surface displacements, and                    excited state geometries of organometallics.",
