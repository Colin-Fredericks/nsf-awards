 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rifting of continental lithosphere during extensional                      tectonics can be accomplished in a variety of ways including                    uniform lithospheric thinning and detachment tectonics in which                 extension is not uniform with depth.  Each model predicts                       different subsidence histories subsequent to extension and these                should be reflected in the sediments in filling the rift basins.                Where rapid subsidence phase is followed by a slower negative                   exponential phase associated with contraction during cooling of                 the rifted lithosphere, whereas the thermal phase is reduced or                 absent if surface extension and rifting is detached from under-                 lying unextended lithosphere.  The Newark Basin of Triassic-                    Jurassic age in the central Appalachians now consists of                        sediments interpreted to represent only the initial rapid                       subsidence phase.  It is unclear if thermal phase sediments were                never deposited (implying detachment tectonics) or deposited but                removed by erosion (implying uniform lithosphere extension).  This              project will collect and interpret detrital apatite fission-track               ages from a transect across the basin in an attempt to determine                the maximum amount of sediment that could have been removed by                  erosion before Cretaceous overlap sediments were deposited.                     Results will bear on rifting style of the initial breakup and                   formation of the present Atlantic ocean, and will provide a well-               documented example of continental-scale extension that can be used              in comparisons to other rift basins.",
