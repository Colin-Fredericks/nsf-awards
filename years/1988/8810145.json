 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the project is to study problems related to the                design of robust and multivariable adaptive control systems.                    Robustness is defined as the ability of an algorithm to maintain                stability in the presence of disturbances and unmoldeled dynamics.  We          plan to apply averaging methods to study the relationship between               robustness and the error equation used for adaptation.  The existence           and location of the tuned values will be investigated.  These values            determine where the controller parameters converge in the presence of           unmodeled dynamics.  The analysis is expected to lead to a better               understanding of robustness in adaptive control, and to suggest new             approaches for design.  We will also be concerned with the design of            multivariable adaptive control systems.  We plan to study                       parameterizations which guarantee parameter convergence to a unique             point, and require a minimal number of parameters.  These properties            are desirable for convergence, robustness, and implementation                   considerations.  The prior information needed to design multivariable           adaptive control systems will also be investigated, together with ways          to obtain this information from input/output measurements.                      Experiments will be carried out to validate the results of the theory,          and motivate new problems.  We expect that the research will                    contribute to improve design methodologies for adaptive control                 systems, and to a wider application of these methods.",
