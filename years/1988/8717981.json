 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in physical                     chemistry between Spela Paljk of the Josef Stefan Institute in                  Ljubljana and Oscar Bonner from the University of South Carolina is             continuation of a U.S.-Yugoslav joint research program on the study             of the physico- chemical properties of associated aqueous and                   non-aqueous solutions.  The aim of this study is to characterize the            structure of associated liquid mixtures by investigating the                    solute-solute (dissolved substances) and the solute-solvent                     interactions.  The proposed study will carefully investigate the                structure of cholesterol, a non-aqueous system.  The investigators              have complementary research interests.  Their previous collaboration            proved productive and resulted in numerous publications in this                 field.                                                                                                                                                          This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a                joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and               Yugoslav governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually by            the Department of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  The grants are            composed principally of Yugolsav dinars and made to the principal               Yugoslav institute.  Grants include travel for U.S. scientists to               Yugoslavia and a modest dollar allowance for Yugoslav scientists'               living expenses in the U.S.",
