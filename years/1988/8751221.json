 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Tulsa Public Schools will expand a successful pilot program to bring        hands-on science experiments into elementary and middle school                  classrooms.  The objective is to expand interest in and appreciation for        science by all students, thereby contributing broadly to the enhancement        of science literacy.  Scientists (one a former college chemistry                professor) with Amoco Production Company's Tulsa Technical Center               developed appropriate physical and biological science experiments and           prepared kits of the necessary materials for them.  Volunteers from the         Junior League, the American Chemical Society, Amoco, Cities Service Co.,        and parent groups were trained, jointly  with teachers, in the use of           these kits and then each went biweekly into the classrooms to support           students working in 2-4 student groups in carrying out the experiments.         The program was tested first in fourth and fifth grade classes, expanded        to middle school, and will now be applied more broadly throughout the           system in those grades.                                                                                                                                         Cost sharing by the partners will total more than 200% of the NSF               funding.",
