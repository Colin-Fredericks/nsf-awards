 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this research is to understand the                  evolutionary mechanisms involved in causing morphological and                   behavioral differences in the sexes.  This is a particularly                    active and controversial area in evolutionary biology.  Several                 competing alternative explanations are still being considered, in               part because appropriate data have not yet been obtained.                               While any group of species that showed differences between              members of the opposite sexes could, in principle, be used, this                research focusses on a group of flies which have three important                attributes that make them ideal for this research.  In some                     species, males have eyes on the ends of stalks which can attain                 lengths greater than two.times the male's body length while                     females have much shorter stalks.  Other closely related species                show less dramatic sexual dimorphism and a few species exhibit no               dimorphism at all and have very short eye stalks.                                       The group is uniquely suited to this research because 1)                these dramatic differences are limited to a single trait. 2)                    several species occur in the same local area and can be studied                 in the field, and most importantly, 3) most of these species can                be reared in the laboratory.  This latter feature is critical                   because breeding experiments can identify the genetic basis                     underlying this trait as well as the genetic influence on female                mate choice behavior.  The results of this research should not                  only allow better understanding of the exaggerated head form of                 these flies, but should also provide insight into the mechanisms                and consequences of sexual dimorphism in other species.//",
