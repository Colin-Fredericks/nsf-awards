 "awd_abstract_narration": "The safe, economical design of earthquake-resistant structures                  requires an understanding of the dynamic motions resulting from                 earthquake loading.  The dynamic interaction between a structure and            its foundation-soil support can have a significant influence on the             response of the  structure.                                                                                                                                     This research program is investigating the building-foundation                  interaction under seismic excitation.  An experimental program is               being conducted on geotechnical centrifuges to simulate the                     performance of multi-story buildings constructed on surface                     foundations (as opposed to pile foundations) when subjected to                  earthquake ground motions.  The study includes investigations of the            free-field motion, steady-state vibrations of foundations, as well as           the full structure-foundation-soil interaction phenomenon.  This                information is being incorporated into a mathematical model to                  describe the dynamic motions of buildings on surface foundations when           subjected to earthquake excitations.                                                                                                                            This mathematical models can also be used to validate, calibrate, and           combine various analytical procedures that have been proposed.                  Another outcome of the study is to further the capability of using the          geotechnical centrifuge to investigate complex soil-structure                   interaction problems.",
