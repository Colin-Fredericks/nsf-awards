 "awd_abstract_narration": "Partial support is provided with other federal agencies for a four-             day symposium on the tribology of surfaces exposed to extreme                   environments.  The symposium will be held in conjunction with the               Fall Meeting of the Materials Research Society during December of               1988. Many developing areas of advanced technology are dependent on             components which operate under very severe environments of                      temperature, vacuum, and/or aggressive gases. In these environments             the tribological problems are especially severe and must be solved              primarily through advances in materials science and engineering.  The           symposium will expose researchers in these fields to current problem            areas in tribology for advanced applications and is expected to                 stimulate research on tribomaterials as well as cross-disciplinary              research between materials science, materials engineering, and more             traditional tribology fields.",
