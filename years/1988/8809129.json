 "awd_abstract_narration": "With any decision problem, the intent is to select the best                     alternative among those available or to create alternatives                     better than those readily apparent.  The concepts of best and                   better are based upon preferences or values.  It is the existence               of values for the consequences of the decision which is the basis               for an interest in that decision problem.  If a decision problem                is complex, almost all analysts argue that a model will lend                    insight to understanding complexity and to making better                        decisions.  To gain the insight available from such a model, it                 is necessary to focus on the basis for the complexity in the                    problem.  Conflicting and intertwined values are often a basis                  for such complexity.  The traditional rational decision making                  model is primarily concerned with the problem of choice among a                 known fixed set of alternatives.  It has rarely considered the                  process by which alternatives or options are developed or the                   interaction of values in this process.                                                                                                                          This proposal investigates basic problems in developing and using               models of values.  Specifically, it focuses on identifying and                  structuring values, developing constructed value indices, and                   creating value driven alternatives.  The research will be                       conducted within the context of four major national decision                    problems.  It should result in a new approach in the development                of normative decision theory as well as in the development of new               operational decision support procedures for difficult complex                   decisions.",
