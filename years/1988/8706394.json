 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support for research designed (1) to                develop an accurate chronology for the climatic records contained               in the Vostok East Antarctic ice-core, including the                            carbon dioxide record soon to be published by C. Lorius and his                 colleagues; and (2) to compare the Vostok records with climate                  records obtained from deep-sea cores.  The work will be carried                 out in close cooperation with Claude Lorius and his colleagues at               Grenoble.  Given an accurate chronology, the length and quality                 of the Vostok record provide an unprecedented opportunity to                    understand the dynamics of processes which change carbon dioxide                and climate.  By cross-correlating the Vostok and deep-sea                      records, investigations proposed here will establish what the                   coherencies and phases are between:  variations in the atmosphere               at Vostok; variations in the temperature, circulation, and carbon               budget of the ocean; and variations in volume of global ice.                         The proposed work promises to link the two most valuable                   records of climate change on orbital time scales (tens to                       hundreds of thousands of years) - ice cores and marine sediment                 cores.  This temporal correlation will allow the PI to                          investigate the detailed nature of climate change in terms of                   atmospheric chemistry, oceanic circulation, and volume of                       continental ice.  The Vostok ice core is of special importance                  because of its great length and excellent resolution.",
