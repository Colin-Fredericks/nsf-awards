 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to the growing importance of neuroscience research in          the behavioral sciences, a neuroscience laboratory has been established         for teaching in psychology. Laboratory experience at all levels of the          undergraduate social science curriculum is offered from freshman                seminars to advanced seminars and independent research projects. The            core of this project is a new upper level course, Laboratory in                 Physiological Psychology, which provides instruction in modern                  neuroanatomical methods. This project requires equipment for                    preparation of animals, for histological processing of neural tissue,           and for analyzing and recording the resulting material. Thus, the               equipment includes operating microscopes for surgery, a sliding                 microtome to cut frozen sections, and compound microscopes equipped to          observe and record fluorescent tracers. This facility complements the           college's molecular neuroscience facility in biology and makes                  available comprehensive neuroscience laboratory courses.                                                                                                             The award will be matched by an equal amount from the grantee.",
