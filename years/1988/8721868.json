 "awd_abstract_narration": "Forested stream beds in the American Midwest are important                 components of the overall ecosystem of the region.   They are critical          determinants of water flow and retention, and they are strongly                 affected by human-induced changes such as dams and channelization.              They are also major sites that affect vegetation species changes.               Professor Malanson will examine seedling establishment and tree growth          in both dammed and less managed rivers in Iowa and determine the                relationships among seedling establishment and growth, flooding, soil           moisture, and light, in relation to species dispersal.  Field data will         be used to develop a mathematical model that simulates seedling                 establishment and tree growth in different kinds of river corridors.            Professor Malanson's research will enlarge our understanding of                 processes producing short- and long-term vegetational change in both            managed and unmanaged riparian areas.",
