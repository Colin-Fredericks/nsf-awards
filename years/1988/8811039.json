 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transmission of information in the brain usually                       involves the passing of particular chemical molecules called                    neurotransmitters from one nerve cell to another at a functional                contact called a synapse.  We still do not know the identity of                 the transmitter from the cells called ganglion cells in the optic               nerve, carrying information from the eye to the brain.  One                     candidate for such a transmitter is a peptide abbreviated NAAG                  that is found in the visual pathways in the brain of several                    mammals including humans, and appears to act at excitatory sites.                    This project will use phamacological application of NAAG on                preparations of brain slices to compare the effects to those seen               in response to direct stimulation of the visual pathways.  The                  distribution of the NAAG in the brain will be examined by                       immunological and other anatomical tracing techniques.  The                     results will provide evidence whether NAAG is found in the                      appropriate locations, in the appropriate amounts, and with the                 appropriate actions, to be considered further as a transmitter.                 The potential impact of these studies on vision is very great,                  since knowledge of the transmitter of the cells in the optic                    nerve, and elsewhere in the visual pathways, will provide a                     valuable mechanism for manipulating and further understanding how               visual information is handled by the brain.  Results will be                    important to other areas of neuroscience, since we do not know                  the primary transmitter for any of the special senses yet, and                  also since this compound is found in other regions of the brain.",
