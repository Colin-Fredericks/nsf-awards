 "awd_abstract_narration": "Size-exclusion chromatography is used widely for preparative                    bioseparations.  This is a basic study to develop a molecular                   based model to describe the penetration of a colloidal solute                   into a porous medium, and to perform batch partitioning                         experiments to validate the microscopic modelling.  The theory                  will involve a density functional approach.  The theory will be                 used to examine the influence of enthalpic effects on the                       selectivity of the porous medium.  Multicomponent systems are                   easily handled, so that competitive aspects of the separation                   mechanism can be analyzed.  The batch experiments will concern a                well-defined colloidal suspension and a well-defined porous                     matrix to make comparisons with theory as clear as possible.                    In addition to the batch experiments, an attempt will be made to                use a light scattering technique to probe the concentration of a                colloidal solute within a porous bed.  If successful, this                      technique could be very useful for studying equilibrium as well                 as non-equilibrium phenomena, in these well-defined interfacial                 systems.",
