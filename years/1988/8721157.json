 "awd_abstract_narration": "When human beings sustain a stroke, traumatic head injury or                    neurotoxic poisoning, they may suffer from \"organic amnesia\" -- a               form of memory loss resulting from damage to the brain.  Clinical               studies of these people have increased our understanding of                     normal memory in two ways.  First, we have been able to identify                many of the brain structures involved in memory.  Second, we are                better able to understand some of the basic mechanisms of memory                as we learn what causes it's malfunction.  Animal models of                     organic amnesia have furthered our understanding of memory                      because the conditions leading to such memory deficits can be                   more carefully controlled.  Studies of animal memory often cannot               be compared directly to human memory, in part because the                       information we ask animals to remember may bear but little                      meaning to their lives.  In their recent studies, Drs. Eichenbaum               and Cohen have shown that rodents possess exceptionally good                    abilities in learning about odors.  In fact, their olfactory                    learning capabilities may be as powerful as are visual memories                 of humans and monkeys.                                                                                                                                          In these studies, Drs. Eichenbaum and Cohen will utilize                        rodents' striking olfactory learning capacities to:  (1) develop                new and more powerful memory tasks similar to those used so                     successfully in monkeys and humans, (2) use these tasks to test                 whether rats demonstrate amnesia as humans do after damage to                   specific brain structures, and (3) employ variations of these                   tasks to clarify how memories are encoded within specific brain                 regions.  The results should indicate whether the qualities of                  memory are the same in humans and in animals.  In addition, their               results may help in the search for treatments of memory loss.",
