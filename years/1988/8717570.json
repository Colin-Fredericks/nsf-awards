 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organic matter and nutrient dynamics in a regrowing northern hard               wood forest following a whole-tree harvest will be studied.                     Particular attention will be paid to changes in the patterns and                magnitudes of organic matter and nutrient pools in the vegetation               and soils of a system in years four and five after cutting.  Root               studies will be emphasized since response to change of this                     belowground component of forest systems in very poorly known.                                                                                                   A number of state-of-the-art techniques will be used in this                    study.  For example, the relative contributions of various plant                species to organic matter stocks in the soil will be determined                 using the cupric oxidation technique.  This is a procedure for                  identifying the proportions of phenolic monomers in lignin of                   plant tissues.  Preliminary evidence suggests that the initial                  proportions and changes in the proportions of the monomers are                  species specific.                                                                                                                                               Well developed forest growth and hydrologic models will aid in                  the synthesis of the data derived from this research.  The                      research plan also includes further development of the below-                   ground portion of the forest growth model.                                                                                                                      This research will add to our understanding of how forests                      recover from disturbance.  The knowledge gained from this study                 is important for developing wise management plans for a critical                natural resource, the nations forests.                                                                                                                          The collaborative research effort between researchers at the                    University of Pennsylvania and Cornell University will be                       augmented by contributions from researchers at the University of                Wyoming and Yale University.  All of the scientists involved in                 the study are productive.  The facilities at all involved                       institutions are excellent.  The research being done at the                     Hubbard Brook Experiment Forest in north central New Hampshire                  and the field facilities there are excellent.",
