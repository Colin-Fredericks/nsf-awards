The                studies described in this proposal on relaxation dynamics of                    spin equilibrium complexes have practical relevance to the field                of optical information storage, and the work on detecting                       and characterizing reactive organometallic intermediates                        has practical importance to catalysis and surface chemistry.                                                                                                    It is proposed to investigate the fundamental chemical and                      physical mechanisms governing the reactions and other                           deactivation processes of excited states and reactive                           intermediates formed by the photoexcitation of transition metal                 organometallic and coordination compounds.  A major emphasis is                 placed on the use of flash lamp and laser pulse photolysis with                 time resolved luminescence and transient absorption spectral                    techniques to prepare and to characterize these short-lived                     species and to study quantitatively their reaction dynamics as                  functions of the nature and condition of the reaction medium.                   Specific systems proposed as part of these continuing studies                   include 1) strongly luminescent complexes of copper(I),                         platinum(II) and rhodium(III); 2) iron(II) compounds displaying                 quintet/singlet spin equilibria and 3) catalytically active                     phosphine complexes of rhodium and iridium plus certain metal                   carbonyl clusters.",
