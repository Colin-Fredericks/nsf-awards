This project is making use of the rich                       natural resources near Puerto Rico to serve as a source of                      potentially novel and useful chemicals. Sponges are being                       collected and extracted, and the biologically active compounds                  are being purified and characterized. New chemicals isolated in                 this work will be evaluated as to their biological activity.                                                                                                         A systematic study will be undertaken of the phospholipid                  fatty acids from the burrowing sponges Anthosigmella varians,                   Chondrilla nucula, Cliona caribboea, Clinoa delitrix, Cliona                    lampa, Siphonodictyon coralliphagum, and Spheciospongia                         vesparium in search of biomedically important metabilites.                      This work represents the first systematic study of isoprenoid                   phospholipid fatty acids from marine sponges.  The origin of                    these isoprenoid fatty acids is to be determined, i.e., whether                 the sponge is synthesizing the acids from isoprene units or if                  they are derived from planktonic or bacterial origin.                           Parallel to the above mentioned work, a program aimed at                        isolating other biologically active compounds i.e. cytotoxic                    agents, from these burrowing sponges is to be initiated. Other                  tests, as for example, antimicrobial, antitumor, etc., will be                  performed accordingly.                                                               The sponge collection and classification program is being                  carried out in collaboration with other biologists from the                     University.",
