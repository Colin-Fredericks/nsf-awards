 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI is proposing to utilize a novel expression system                        (baculovirus vectors) to determine the functional significance of               the various isoforms of tyrosine hydroxylase.  Tyrosine                         hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine                   biosynthesis and, as such, is a crucial and pivotal point in many               physiological processes.  Recently, the PI's laboratory has                     isolated full length cDNAs of the multiple human subtypes.  To                  investigate whether these different isotypes have altered                       functions,  the PI will subclone the cDNAs into the baculovirus                 expression vectors.  This system will generate large quantities                 of the different forms of TH to permit kinetic and structural                   analyses.  This system will also provide the means to use site-                 directed mutagenesis to assess the role of particular amino acids               in phosphorylation, catalysis, cofactor binding, etc.  Results                  from these studies will delineate structural requirements for TH                regulation and expression and will help understand mechanisms of                activation and possible roles in atypical catecholamine                         function.***//",
