 "awd_abstract_narration": "Frustration expressed by many researchers attempting to compare                 modern and ancient reefs is in large part due to critical flaws                 in present-day models.  Most of these models are based on limited               examples from Florida and the Bahamas, and they generally focus                 in constructional processes in the shallowest portions of the                   reef.  Recent studies have shown that patterns of accretion need                not mimic the ability of organisms on the reef surface to produce               calcium carbonate.  Secondary processes that break down and                     constantly reorganize the reef interior lead to depositional                    facies that are dominated by detrital fabrics, with significant                 accretion occurring in deeper forereef areas.  This project will                collect core data from Caribbean reef environments along                        recognized gradients in both physical process and surficial                     character of the reefs.  At each locality, cores collected along                the entire shelf profile will provide informaiton on the overall                reef system rather than limitation to the shallow, exposed reef                 crests that have been the focus of most studies to date.                        %%%                                                                                                                                                             The internal structure of modern carbonate reefs in deep water                  is largely unknown due to the inaccessibility to precise                        sampling.  This project will use a newly designed drilling                      system to recover samples of coral reefs in Caribbean Sea.  The                 samples will reveal how coral reefs grow, the control of supply                 and sealevel on that growth, and extend our knowledge of reef                   processes from the present understanding of shallow water to                    deep water processes.",
