 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between                          Prof. Leonard Interrante of Rensselaer Polytechnic                              Institute and Dr. Patrick Cassoux of the Laboratory                             for Coordination Chemistry of CNRS, Toulouse, France,                           on the chemistry of transition metal compounds.                                 Molecular and polymeric precursors to selected                                  transition metal silicides, carbides, and nitrides                              will be synthesized and studied.  The objective of                              this work is to increase our fundamental understanding                          of the pyrolysis chemistry of potential                                         organo-metallic and coordination compound precursors                            and the relationship of this pyrolysis chemistry to                             molecular structure.  Various materials may be                                  inserted into the organometallic derivatives of the                             pyrolytically reacting constituents.  The effect of                             different materials on the temperatures at which these                          derivatives decompose, and on the composition of the                            solid reaction products, will be studied, using both                            thermal analysis methods and by the identification of                           the pyrolysis products.  Particular emphasis will be                            placed on the silicides of tungsten, molybdenum, and                            other refractory metals, but additional investigations                          of the carbides and nitrides of Ti, Zr, and Hf will                             also be made.                                                                                                                                                   The U.S. and French collaborators will continue joint                           efforts begun several years ago.  The French                                    collaborator has considerable experience in the area                            of transition metal coordination chemistry and                                  overall, the group in France has analysis experience                            and equipment complementary to that available at the                            U.S. institution.  The refractory metal compounds to                            be considered are of importance in evolving                                     semiconductor technologies.  Their low-temperature                              pyrolytic deposition, which could be made possible as                           a result of this research, would be of considerable                             significance.",
