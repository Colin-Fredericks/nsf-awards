 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research on this grant is in two areas of algebraic                    geometry, namely, singularities and invariant theory.  In the                   field of singularities, the main aims are to construct                          geometrically meaningful compactifications of moduli spaces for                 surfaces of general type, to give a complete description of the                 versal deformation space of a quotient surface singularity and to               analyze the geometry of canonical threefold singularities.  In                  invariant theory the aim is to extend the recent results on the                 rationality of orbit spaces, namely, an attempt to prove the                    rationality of the moduli spaces of curves of genus three and                   five will be made.                                                                   The subject of this research is algebraic geometry, the                    study of the geometric objects one obtains as solutions of                      algebraic equations.  The study of the singularities in these                   objects (cusps etc) is important for the understanding of their                 properties.  Moreover the rationality of space of curves of a                   fixed type is a topic of much research.",
