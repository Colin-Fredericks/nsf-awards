 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project examines the relationship between                    sorcery beliefs and practices and other modes of processing                     interpersonal disputes in communities on Siquijor Island, the                   Philippines.  The student aims to delineate the cultural values                 and cosmological beliefs which affect interpersonal conflict and                conflict resolution and to analyze the role which sorcery plays                 in the mediation of conflicts.  He will test the hypothesis that                sorcery is chosen as a mode of dispute processing when mediation                is unsuccessful.                                                                     This research will contribute to our knowledge of sorcery                  and religion, dispute processing, social relations, and                         interpersonal conflict in the Philippines.  While sorcery is                    often characterized as an illegitimate or pathological form of                  social control, this research will show that it is part of a                    larger system of values that make the world comprehensible to its               inhabitants.  This research will uniquely advance our                           understanding of Philippine social relations.                                        Social relationships are determined by considerations of                   conflict as much as by positive goals such as social reciprocity                and companionship.  Because this project will focus on conflict-                causing issues, the means used to process disputes, and the                     consequences of conflicts, it will shed light on the relationship               between conflict and the structuring of social behavior.",
