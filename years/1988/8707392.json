 "awd_abstract_narration": "An accurate and efficient method for the three-dimensional                 analysis of cracks in elastic solids is applied to the study of                 quasi-statically advancing slip zones in the earth's crust.                     Calculations are done to determine stresses and surface                         deformations due to the advance of shear faults into and around                 locked, or more resistant, portions of the shallow crust.  Of                   particular interest are conditions for which non-uniformities in                the advancing front are unstable, in the sense that they give rise              to rapid spontaneous propagation of slip, and conditions that may               distinguish small from large earthquakes.  These calculations also              make it possible to relate measurements of surface deformation to               increases in seismicity that may be triggered by the elevation of               stresses that accompanies slip zone advance.  Other effects                     considered are the possibility of breakout at the free surface and              the coupling of normal and shear stress due to the presence of the              free surface.  Initial studies will be for strike-slip geometries               for possible application to the Parkfield region of southern                    California, but the versatility of the method allows study of                   thrust-faults, as well.",
