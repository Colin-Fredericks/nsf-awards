 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Carl Woese of the University of Illinois will continue              his work toward understanding the natural (phylogenetic)                        relationships among the myriad species of eubacteria.  The                      evolutionary relationships among species are assessed by                        determining the degree of similarity (or difference) between                    ribosomal RNA sequences from one species to another.  From a set                of (binary) sequence differences - expressed either as percent                  sequence difference, or in terms of the actual nucleotide                       positions in the sequence that show differences - evolutionary                  trees can be constructed by standard statistical procedures, in                 the first case by what is called distance matrix analysis, in the               second by the procedure known as maximum parsimony analysis.                            Ribosomal RNA is a key and highly conserved molecule in the             cell, being involved in the translation process, the process                    whereby genetic information is \"translated\" into enzymes and                    proteins.  Therefore, it has retained in its sequence alignment a               significant amount of historical information about various                      lineages.  Dr. Woese has pioneered the development of molecular                 methods for phylogenetic analysis of bacterial genes and of                     bacterial evolution.",
