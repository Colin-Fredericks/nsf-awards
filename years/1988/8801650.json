 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid development and intensification of winter cyclones               in coastal regions presents a major weather forecasting problem.                Along the eastern seaboard, the development of cyclonic storms                  and frontal systems often occurs along the coastal region of the                Carolinas.  These weather systems may lead to severe weather in                 the heavily populated Northeast Corridor in the form of freezing                rain, heavy snowfall, blizzards and extensive coastal erosion.                  In order to study these phenomena, the National Science                         Foundation sponsored an intensive field investigation known as                  the Genesis of Atlantic Lows Experiment (GALE).  The field phase                of the GALE was a two-month, multiagency endeavor executed during               the winter of 1986.                                                                  As part of the GALE, the Principal Investigator was                        instrumental in designing and implementing a network to study the               redistribution of heat and moisture in the lowest three                         kilometers of the atmosphere over the ocean which is known as the               marine boundary layer (MBL).  The MBL and ocean-atmosphere                      interaction processes appear to play an important role in the                   genesis of cyclones or in the intensification of an existing                    cyclone.  Preliminary analysis of the data has shown                            exceptionally large heat fluxes in the vicinity of the Gulf                     Stream.                                                                              The Principal Investigator will continue his work on the MBL               using a combination of data collected during the GALE and                       numerical models.  One goal is to test and formulate new                        approximations for boundary layer processes which can be used in                numerical weather forecast models.",
