 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for a conference addressing the             roles that science and engineering societies in the Caribbean could             play in improving the application of S & T to development needs in the          region.  The conference has been organized jointly by the Center for            Energy and Environment Research of the University of Puerto Rico, the           Caribbean Association of Universities and Research Institutes, and              other regional organizations, together with the Western Hemisphere              office of the AAAS.  It is modeled after similar conferences held in            Africa and India in the past few years and builds on a worldwide United         Nations conference on the same subject held in 1983.  The agenda is             generally organized to focus discussion on the status of the societies          in the islands, ways in which they could be strengthened, and ways in           which they could assist their members to apply their capabilities to            the problems of development.  Working Groups have prepared action               recommendations for the conference in the areas of communication,               education and natural resources.                                                                                                                                No single Caribbean nation has the critical mass of scientists in all           the fields necessary to address their many technical development needs          effectively.  The small size of these countries precludes their ever            achieving such a critical mass.  Strengthening communication and                concrete collaboration among the scientific communities of the islands,         including Puerto Rico, will strengthen their capabilities and                   infrastructure.  They will become better able to carry out relevant             research and also better able to collaborate effectively with the U.S.          and other industrialed countries.  This conference is well designed to          explore concrete ways to channel and link the abilities of local                scientists through regional networks.",
