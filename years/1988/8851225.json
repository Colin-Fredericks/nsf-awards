 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of the molecular biology research laboratory for            undergraduate women in science are:  (1)  to establish a state-of-the-          art research laboratory in molecular biology to prepare women for               biomedical careers and/or graduate research;  (2)  to strengthen the            College's existing research internship program by establishing an on-           campus lab equipped to permit more sophisticated student research and           independent study; and   (3)  to foster a \"partners in scholarship\"             atmosphere for faculty and students in the Biology Department.                                                                                                       The acquisition of the electrophoresis apparatus, centrifuges, a           spectrophotometer, and support instrumentation (incubators, sterilizer,         orbital shaker) are modernizing the laboratory for student research in          molecular biology.  This lab enables students to learn the latest               techniques employed in studying the molecular biology of proteins and           nucleic acids, and then permits them to apply these techniques by               designing and carrying out an independent research project.  Research           projects culminate in a seminar presented to the Missouri Academy of            Science and a research manuscript.  Some of the latter have proved to           be suitable for publication.                                                                                                                                         The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
