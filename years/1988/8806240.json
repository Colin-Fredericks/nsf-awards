 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several of the major nitrogen metabolic pathways are impacted                   by activities of the arginine biosynthetic pathway.  In                         plants, little is known regarding the metabolic regulation of                   arginine biosynthesis.  Similarly, mechanisms regulating the                    activity of ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), the enzyme that                   catalyzes the first committed step in the arginine                              biosynthetic pathway, are unknown.  The dynamics of nitrogen                    allocation to the arginine, pyrimidine nucleotide and                           polyamine biosynthetic pathways will be investigated under                      different physiological conditions, using radiolabeled                          precursors and specific inhibitors of these pathways.  These                    experiments will be carried out in two model systems (tobacco                   transformed with the nopaline synthase containing Ti plasmid                    pGV3850 and osmotically-stressed oat leaf) in which high                        rates of arginine utilization in the tissue would be expected                   to support elevated arginine pathway and OTC activities.%%%                                                                                                     Nitrogen metabolism in plants is affected when the plant is                     stressed.  This project investigates the pathway of polyamine                   biosynthesis and how it is regulated during stress.  This                       will lead to a better understanding of the changes taking                       place in the plant.  Interventions will be possible to                          protect plant productivity.***//",
