 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project makes microcomputer technology a central part of the          undergraduate experience in psychology.  It establishes an interactive          classroom and two computer laboratories.  The interactive classroom is          equipped with a microcomputer, a video recorder, and a multi-sync video         projection system for effective in-class demonstrations of                      microcomputer applications.  The statistics laboratory enables the              conduct of laboratory assignments requiring data analysis and                   simulation, and the on line laboratory permits the on line control of           experiments.  The classroom and laboratory microcomputers are networked         in order to provide the advantages of a mainframe system without the            corresponding limitations.                                                                                                                                            Undergraduates are involved in all phases of the use of                   microcomputer technology in research, data acquisition, on line                 experimental control, data retrieval, data analysis, bibliographic              work, report writing, graph making, and simulation. Student proficiency         in using microcomputers is a means to deeper understanding of basic             psychological principals as well as an end in itself.                                                                                                                The award will be matched by an equal sum from the grantee.",
