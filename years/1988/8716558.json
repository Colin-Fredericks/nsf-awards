 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of U.S. researchers in                a seminar on \"Endogenous Sleep Factors\" organized jointly by Dr.                James Krueger of the University of Tennessee and Professor                      Shojiro Inoue of the Tokyo Medical and Dental University.                       United States and Japanese participants will meet in Honolulu,                  Hawaii in November 1988.  The seminar will provide a forum for                  the exchange of research results and ideas related to                           sleep-promoting substances or sleep factors (SF).  Objectives of                the seminar are:  1) establish definitions and working                          hypotheses on SFs; 2) present evidence concerning newly                         described SFs; 3) discuss biochemical regulatory pathways for                   SFs; 4) present cellular and molecular models for mechanisms of                 actions of SFs; 5) discuss the interrelationships between SFs                   and substances involved in both immune and body temperature                     regulation; and 6) provide a historical record from which the                   field may grow.                                                                                                                                                 Sleep research and sleep factor research, in particular, are in                 a state of flux.  New and surprising interactions and substances                have been described in the past few years and it is likely that                 such advances will lead to a better understanding of the                        fundamental brain mechanisms of sleep.  This seminar, by                        bringing together scientists from the United States and Japan                   which are at the forefront of sleep factor research, will                       promote progress and cooperation in the field.",
