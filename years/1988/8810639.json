 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with both experimental and analytical                   investigations of the abrasive waterjet cutting of materials.  The              advent of new and more difficult-to-manufacture materials lead to               the development of many advanced manufacturing techniques, the so-              called non-traditional machine processes, of which abrasive waterjet            is one.  Mathematical models will be developed using the equations              of motion for the waterjet, and the abrasive particles, as well as              the energy balance in the impingement zone.  Non-dimensional numbers            characterizing the process will be determined and used to develop               regression equations relating process variables.  Experimental                  studies will be carried out to validate selected equations and                  evaluate the coefficients.  The experiments will involve piercing               and cutting plexiglass plates, monitoring process variables and                 estimating cutting performance.  The measured variables include                 velocities of the water jet and abrasive particles, distribution of             forces at the jet/solid interface and rate of motion of this                    interface.  The Laser anemometry, Mach lines technique, high speed              photography will be used to measure velocity.  High speed filming               will also be used to study the kinetics of surface formation.  The              topography of surfaces will be studied by constructing (cutting slit            or notch) replicas and optical and electron microscopy of the                   surfaces.  The procedure will enable generating data for                        optimization and development of abrasive waterjet cutting.",
