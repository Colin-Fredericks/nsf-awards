 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports U.S. participation in an                    international symposium and workshop on microbial conversion                    of biomass to be held in Lahore, Pakistan in February, 1989.                    In addition to U.S. and Pakistani scientists, participants are                  expected from several third world countries.  The symposium is                  to provide the Pakistani and third world scientists with the                    most recent information on the subject, and to impart to them                   current experimental techniques.  The workshop is planned to                    help identify specific scientific problems of interest to the                   U.S. and to Pakistan and to develop outlines for joint                          research leading to their solutions.  Topics to be covered                      include biological means for improving the breakdown of                         lignocellulose, optimum enzyme production, genetic                              manipulation of test organisms, improving pentose fermentation                  to ethanol, methane production from biomass, lignin                             degredation in fungi by photoplast fusion, microbial                            degradation of lignin, oil degredation organisms, the recovery                  of metal by microorganisms, and the practical aspects of                        gaseous energy production.  A workshop proceedings is expected                  to result from the meeting.                                                                                                                                     Scope:  The cooperating Pakistani scientist, Dr. Kauser Malik,                  at the Pakistan Nuclear Institute for Agriculture and Biology                   in Faisalabad, Pakistan is one of the most dynamic and                          productive researchers in Pakistan in the field of                              biotechnology.  His institute (NIAB) is well equipped to                        organize the meeting and to manage the technical sessions and                   the proceedings production.  Dr. Malik and the P.I. are                         currently collaborating on several projects funded by NSF and                   others funded by AID.  Their cooperation in this meeting and                    the good selection of U.S. participants to cover the various                    specific areas will likely lead to a successful result.",
