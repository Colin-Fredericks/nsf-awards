 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with the creation of molecular scale tubules                 with special properties.  The investigator proposes to convert                  special columnar liquid crystals with disk-like components into                 stable multi-molecular hollow cylinders which have hydrophobic                  exteriors and hydrophilic interiors.  The size and shape and mirror             image selectivity of the holes in the cylinders can be varied to allow          a wide variety of ions and enantiomers to be complexed and separated.           The special columns are stabilized by polymerizing appropriate groups           which are introduced into their alkyl chains.  The type and location            of the groups on the chains will allow intracolumnar (vertical) and/or          intercolumnar (horizontal) polymerization to occur selectively.                 Following the above processes, the template saccharide units are                removed, leaving hollow microcylinders.                                                                                                                         If successful, this approach will allow a wide variety of robust                molecular aggregates to be employed as selective membranes and                  complexing agents.  Since the template core groups of the hollow                cylinders can be a variety of cyclic saccharides, diverse sizes                 and shapes of guest molecules can be included in the hollow cylinders           to the exclusion of their relatives.  It is anticipated that this               approach could lead to development of membranes which can be                    engineered, as specific needs arise, by selecting an appropriate                precursor saccharide from the shelf.  The possible applications for             the proposed devises are manifold.  In the drug industry, they can be           used to remove deleterious side products or to isolate small                    quantities of beneficial species in the presence of large excesses of           other compounds.  If the precursor columnar liquid crystals can be              oriented with magnetic or electrical fields, the polymerized cylinders          may be sufficiently long to serve as molecular light pipes or                   one-dimensional, single electron wires.  Though fabrication of these            devices is outside the scope of this project, the objective of the              project is to discern the feasibility of an approach which could                eventually lead to such novel devices.",
