 "awd_abstract_narration": "Salt domes are being used in both the United States and elsewhere for           the storage of fluids other than water.  Concerns exist about the               rate at which stored gases diffuse through the salt and escape.  Such           gaseous movement can result in significant economic losses and can              also pose dangers to the environment.  Analyses used to predict the             escape rates involve massive amount of computer time and have proved            excessively expensive and time consuming for practical use.  This               grant is to provide the principal investigator with two mini-                   computers (workstations) which will be dedicated to research on                 diffusion rates of gases in solids, and will allow the principal                investigators and his students to develop highly efficient and                  practical numerical schemes for analysis of these problems.",
