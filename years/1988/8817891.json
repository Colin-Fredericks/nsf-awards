 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Symposium on Combustion and Plasma Synthesis of High          Temperature Materials focuses on three related areas of materials               synthesis:  Solid-State Combustion Synthesis, Gas-Phase Combustion              Synthesis, and Plasma Synthesis of ceramic and metallic phases                  including composite materials.  The Symposium is international in               character.  It aims at accomplishing the following:                             a.  Address in an open forum for the first time in the US the                   topic of solid-state combustion and thus help stimulate activities in           this area of research.  This will particularly be enhanced by                   presentations on well established activities from aboard, especially            Japan and the Soviet Union.                                                     b.  Bring together researchers from the three areas of                          investigation listed above to facilitate the exchange of ideas on               problems related to synthesis and processing of materials.                      c.  Help focus attention on the potential of this process for                   technology transfer to industrial firms dealing with materials                  preparation and processing.                                                     d.  Acquaint graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in the                 fields of Materials Science, Chemical Engineering, and                          Chemistry with this area of research.                                                                                                                           The Symposium is a valuable input to the objectives of NSF, and                 in particular to the Combustion/Plasma program (CBTE).  This area               of rapidly advancing research is significant to the US future                   performance in international competitiveness.",
