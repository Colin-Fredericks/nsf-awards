 "awd_abstract_narration": "Broad social-psychological analyses of intergroup relations                     incorporate theory from many diverse substantive domains within                 the field.  This research takes one of these theoretical                        segments and attempts to develop further its application to                     group relations.  Specifically, it examines the effects of                      factors that regulate the salience of the category to which                     members of interacting groups belong.  It assesses the effects                  of social category salience on various measures of bias,                        hostility, and social acceptance.  It assumes that negative                     affect and prejudice, when directed toward members of social                    categories, are dysfunctional to group productivity and                         contribute to intergroup conflict.                                                                                                                              The research builds on a theoretical model concerned with                       social category salience and intergroup relations and an                        experimental laboratory paradigm for studying its effects when                  members of two or more groups work cooperatively to solve a                     group problem.  Some studies will create two artificial groups                  from a set of strangers brought into the laboratory.  To                        integrate their outcomes with \"real-world\" situations, other                    studies will conceptually replicate them with members of                        natural social categories -- e.g. racial ethnic groups,                         commuter students versus fraternity row students.  Non-                         voluntary facial electromyographic responses and other                          psychophysiological measurement procedures that minimize the                    intrusion of self presentational concerns will be examined in                   studies coordinated with the intergroup experiments.  The                       studies employ multiple dependent measures to illuminate                        underlying process better, but also in response to the fact                     that theoretical models differ in their predictions for                         different response systems.  Additionally, the studies consider                 theoretical issues raised in recent conceptual analyses of                      intergroup relations.                                                                                                                                           Practical applications of the variables stressed as important                   by the theoretical model do not require that highly trained                     personnel maintain direct interaction with the individuals in a                 workteam over the course of time in order to improve intergroup                 relations.  Instead, they translate into simple rules                           concerning procedures for forming and instructing workteams.",
