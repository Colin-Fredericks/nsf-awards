He is scheduled to                lecture on the theory of hypergeometric series and orthogonal                   polynomials and to conduct research into orthagonal polynomials in              several variables associated with intertwining operators for certain            induced representatives of the symmetric groups and the general linear          groups over a finite field.                                                                                                                                     Scope:  The P.I. is an active researcher who has visited India before           and spent one year at the prestigious Tata Institute of Fundamental             Research.  His project now takes him to an excellent research institute         in Calcutta where significant research and graduate teaching is being           done on various aspects of mathematics, and statistics and their                applications to various science fields.  His proposed visit will                include, in addition to teaching, research in an area where he hopes to         develop computable theory of certain polynomials, with large potential          applications.  His work at the ISI, calcutta is likely to benefit his           research, to benefit his Indian hosts and to lead to future                     collaboration.",
