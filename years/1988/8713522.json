 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of the articulation of vowels in a large number                 of languages, through the examination of collections of x-ray                   photographs located in repositories in Budapest, Strasbourg,                    Toronto, and Iowa City.  No new x-ray photographs will be made.                 It is expected that comparison of these photographs will                        demonstrate that the range of variation across speakers of a                    given language will be systematically constrained, and from                     language to language there will be regular differences in vowel                 articulation.                                                                                                                                                   This study has the potential to contribute to a quantitative                    model of articulation in support of phonological theory, which                  until now has made tenuous connections between basically                        perceptual features and the actual configuation of the vocal                    track during speech production.  The hypothesis of the                          investigators is that there is a finite set of \"articulatory                    primes\" which serve as the building blocks of all vowel                         articulations observed across languages.",
