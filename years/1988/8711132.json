 "awd_abstract_narration": "This renewal proposal from Dr. Fuhrman is for an extension              of studies on dissolved free amino acids (DFAAs), with new                      emphasis on the open sea.  The DFAAs are important sources of                   organic C and N, and represent excellent models of biologically-                labile dissolved organic matter (DOM).  DOM flux is now known to                be a major part of the marine C and N cycles.  Recent work                      demonstrating very rapid turnover of small DFAA pools has shown a               need to revise previous ideas in this area.  This proposal                      includes extensive studies of DFAA turnover, flux, and                          availability in the oligothrophic and deep ocean, from which                    reliable data are sparse.  Other proposed work includes measuring               DFAA release from zooplankton fecal pellets, the microbial                      responses to sudden DFAA enrichment as might be found in                        \"enriched microzones,\" algal assimilation of DFAAs, ammonium                    regeneration from DFAAs, and degradation of peptides and                        proteins.  In addition to the usual tritiated tracers, for some                 of this work the fate of the amino acid nitrogen will be traced                 with the short-lived isotope N-13.  This isotope has a very high                specific activity, so it can be added at true trace levels with                 great sensitivity.  But due to its brief useful lifetime (ca. 90                min.), samples must be transported to the cyclotron, so for these               experiments the use of a helicopter to sample offshore waters is                required.",
