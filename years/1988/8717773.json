 "awd_abstract_narration": "This very ambitious proposal received three VG reviews and one G.               It is truly an interdisciplinary effort involving people involved               in structural mechanics, computer science, and optimization, and                cuts across four departments at the University of Colorado,                     Mechanical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Electrical                       Engineering, and Computer Science.  The overall goal is to                      implement methods appropriate for parallel processing which are                 necessary to solve large structural mechanics problems, e.g., a                 projected space station.  Even the lowest reviewer stated that                  \"this is an interesting proposal\".                                                                                                                              This is indeed an \"interesting\" proposal and deserves support,                  but not at the inflated amount originally requested.  The                       realities of program funding make it necessary to fund this for                 only two years, and consideration of the current support of the                 faculty involved makes it necessary to eliminate them from the                  funding.  As recommended by one of the reviewers, this means that               the scope of the research will have to be cut back considerably,                but it is still \"an already complicated problem\".  One of the                   major aspects of this support is the inclusion of four graduate                 students in the work.  This is an excellent opportunity for these               students to be exposed to a significant amount of cross                         disciplinary effort during their education.                                                                                                                     The new budget was negotiated directly with the PI's, and                       approved by the university.  I recommend funding as a standard                  grant for two years since the CSE/NT program is already heavily                 committed into the future, and further program funding prospects                are uncertain.  The two year funding levels will be:                                                                                                                                Year 1 -  $ 138,548                                                             Year 2 -    154,420                                                                       ---------                                                                       $ 292,968",
