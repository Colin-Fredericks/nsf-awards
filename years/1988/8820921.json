 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this grant is to provide support for the                         preparation of background reports that will provide guidance on                 two research areas of growing importance to the assessment and                  management of environmental risks.  These reports will contribute               to an improved understanding of the role of risk assessment in                  environmental decision making and will help to establish a future               research agenda that will encourage interaction among scientists                involved in risk assessment, public policy, and decision making.                                                                                                The two research areas are closely linked, both by theory and by                application.  The first area is global cumulative impacts,                      including impacts such as global warming, sea level rise, and                   ozone layer depletion.  The OEQ effort will provide a statement                 of scientific principles to help focus attention on those                       environmental and health effects of greatest concern and to                     assist in the development of appropriate mitigation strategies.                 The second area is emerging technologies, which offer the promise               of various benefits to mankind including less environmentally                   invasive alternatives to some existing technologies.  The OEQ                   effort will provide guidance on the use of techniques for                       assessing the health and environmental impacts associated with                  these emerging technologies, under the premise that sensitivity                 to these potential impacts is required at an early stage of                     technology development.",
