 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry provides                     support for the work of Professor Paul Schaap at Wayne State                    University. The work explores the properties of thermally                       stable dioxetanes which can be triggered by chemical reagents                   or enzymes to generate chemilumescence in organic solvents or                   in aqueous solution. This work will give significant new                        insights into chemiluminescent and bioluminescent processes.                    The results may also lead to the development of new methods for                 ultrasensitive biological assays including luminescent                          enzyme-like immunoassays and DNA probes.                                                                                                                        Various types of dioxetanes will be studied to provide an                       understanding of the structural requirements for efficient                      chemiexcitation. The mechanism for the formation of excited                     states will be further elucidated by an analysis of solvent                     effects and kinetic parameters.  Chemical triggering will                       involve the synthesis of appropriately functionalized                           dioxetanes for use as chemiluminescent substrates with alkaline                 phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, chymotrypsin, aminopeptidase,                  and lipase. Preliminary studies have shown that binding of the                  dioxetane to the enzyme can result in enhanced                                  chemiluminescence compared to chemical triggering in aqueous                    buffers. Enzyme kinetic studies will also be carried out to                     determine Michaelis constants and turnover numbers. Chemical                    and enzymatic triggering of dioxetanes will also be                             investigated in organized assemblies such as micelles and                       liposomes. Incorporation of the dioxetane and a flourescent                     co-micellar surfactant in micelles will afford efficient                        energy-transfer chemiluminescence.  Experiments with reversed                   micelles will also be conducted.",
