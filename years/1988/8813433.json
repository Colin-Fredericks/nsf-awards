 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physiological stress is frequently implicated as a cause of                forest tree susceptibility to herbivores, and has been                          hypothesized as a casual factor in outbreaks of the gypsy moth.                 Despite much speculation, there have been few comprehensive                     studies seeking to identify a casual relationship.  This                        research program is designed to do so, using the gypsy moth, two                important hostplants, and a baculovirus.  Oak leaf traits                       influence gypsy moth growth, reproduction, and resistance to a                  virus.  This project will determine the influence of drought and                nutrient stresses on these leaf traits in controlled experiments,               and the consequences for aspects of gypsy moth performance likely               to influence its population dynamics.  This project integrates                  research by a specialist in oak physiology with that of chemical                ecologist already working on this system.  This 3-trophic-level                 study offers promise of understanding causes of pest irruptions,                insight into the basis of plant-herbivore interactions, and                     improved pest control via developing more effective microbial                   insecticides, population trend predictions, and stand                           manipulation.",
