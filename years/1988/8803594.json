The DOI has                already queried the 650 companies underwriting in California as to              their total losses due to this earthquake.                                                                                                                      This study involves a second questionnaire, conducted with the                  cooperation of DOI, requesting detailed information on each and every           loss claim paid out, by each company.  The results of the study will            be detailed information on losses, for all lines of insurance.  Loss            information of this nature has not previously been collected on an              industry-wide basis.  Availability of this information will permit              more accurate determination of the effects of deductibles, and of the           relation of building shake loss to other losses, such as fire, inland           marine, workers compensation, auto, etc.",
