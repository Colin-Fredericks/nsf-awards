 "awd_abstract_narration": "To enhance our understanding of dispute settlement, study of settlement         by informal modes of justice as well as by formal courts is needed.  A          core issue for scientific inquiry is whether the social structure in a          village influences the effectiveness of dispute management by informal          modes.  The research being undertaken by Dr. Vincentnathan, who will be         a guest scientist at Annamalai University in India, offers an                   opportunity to assess the impact of variation in social ideology on             dispute processing, while holding constant the cultural and linguistic          context in which this variation occurs.                                                                                                                         Specifically, utilizing ethnographic methods, Dr. Vincentnathan seeks           to examine traditional dispute-handling tribunals in two villages with          differing caste structures in South India in order to assess the degree         to which the handling of disputes serves to maintain a traditional              social hierarchy or to which it serves to foster the quest for social           equality and integration.  By examining disputes in the context of              these non-Western villages, the study will expand our knowledge of the          forms that disputes may take and of dispute managing methods.                                                                                                   The Law and Social Science Program and the United States-India                  Cooperative Science Program (USICSP), are jointly supporting this               project.  The source of support from USICSP is provided by U.S.-owned           Indian rupees, administered by the National Science Foundation Division         of International Programs.",
