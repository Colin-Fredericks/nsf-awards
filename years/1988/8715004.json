 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a U.S.-France Workshop on the Chemistry                 of Macromolecular Materials to be held in Williamsburg, Virginia                in April 1988.  The workshop will be jointly organized by Dr.                   James McGrath, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and Dr. Ernest                   Marechal, Laboratoire de Synthese Macromoleculaire, University                  of Pierre and Marie Curie, Paris, France.  The meeting will                     focus on polymer synthesis and modification reactions that are                  necessary to produce important materials.  Three subthemes will                 include (1) the chemistry of isotropic and anisotropic matrix                   resins, (2) the synthesis and characterization of multiphase                    polymers and (3) the utilization of reactive processing,                        particularly with regard to grafting reactions, segmented                       copolymer synthesis and block copolymer-homopolymer blend                       preparations.  The program will be oriented toward the                          development of novel chemistry that can be applied to prepare                   and modify high performance engineering matrix resins in related                systems.                                                                                                                                                        Given the significant growth and utilization of macromolecular                  materials, the workshop is very timely.  Despite rapid growth,                  there has been insufficient emphasis placed on the important                    chemistry and structural characterization identified with this                  field.  In particular, the development of advanced composite                    materials, which are useful in many industrial applications,                    such as the aerospace, automotive, and electronic industries,                   has proceeded to the stage where additional progress can only be                made by new advances in the synthesis of matrix resins and                      related materials.  France has been particularly strong in                      polymer synthesis, and the French co-organizer Dr. Marechal is                  an internationally recognized expert in the development of new                  polymeric materials.  This seminar will provide an important                    forum for the exchange of information between U.S. and French                   polymer chemists.",
