 "awd_abstract_narration": "The coherence properties of semiconductor lasers determine the limits           of their application in optical communication channels, computation             and storage.  Before these limits can be enhanced, the sources of               laser instability and noise need to be understood.  Through novel               statistical experiments and theoretical calculations, we propose to             discover new principles for the development of stable lasers and noise          reduction by geometric reconfiguration, manipulation of material                properties, and the application of electronic feedback techniques.  We          will probe correlations between operating parameters and laser                  response over time scales from seconds to picoseconds.  We will study           (i) reflection induced instabilities, (ii) mode partition noise and             mode-hopping, (iii) the linewidth (power dependent and independent)             and dynamics of solitary and external cavity semiconductor lasers and           (iv) low frequency 1/f noise.  The generation of quantum states with            sub-Poissonian statistics by semiconductor lasers will be examined.             The role of deterministic chaos and quantum noise in reflection                 instabilities will be studied with very fast transient digitizers.  We          expect to develop design strategies for constructing stable lasers.             Monte Carlo simulations will be used to test hypotheses on the origins          of laser instabilities in conjunction with the experiments.  The                lasers thus developed could be used for information processing,                 pumping solid state lasers and for precision measurements.",
