 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will test current procedures of using modern                  sexing criteria on fossil hominid remains, which has proven to be               more complex than previously believed.  The student will test the               limitations of using modern bony pelvis measurements for                        determining sexual dimorphism in the earliest hominids at the                   period of the transition to bipedalism.  The student will test                  the hypothesis that the greater sciatic notch was probably not                  related to sexual differentiation of the pelvis but rather to                   changes in the pelvis for bipedality.                                                This research will help paleoanthropologists determine which               sexually dimorphic traits in modern humans and pongids will be                  strong sex discriminators in fossil hominids.  It will also test                assumptions about the effects on the hominid female skeleton due                to increases in infant skull size.                                                   There is current debate over the sexing of fossil hominids                 and the amount of sexual dimorphism in specific species.  This                  research project will help in refining the criteria by which                    fossils are identified as to sex.",
