 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry provides                     support for the research of Dr. Peter Gaspar, Washington                        University. This work is focused on studies of short-lived                      species in carbon, silicon, and germanium chemistry. An                         understanding of such species, particularly those of silicon                    and germanium, has important practical implications because                     they may be important in a number of industrial processes,                      especially ones in the semiconductor industry.                                                                                                                  A coordinated set of experiments will be carried out to                         elucidate chemical reaction mechanisms for short-lived                          molecules containing divalent carbon, silicon and germanium                     atoms.  A complete understanding of the factors influencing                     their reactivity will enhance the ability to control their                      highly useful reactions.  Another goal of this project is to                    determine how the mechanistic ideas of organic chemistry need                   to be modified to deal with bond-making and bond cleavage below                 the first-row of the periodic table.  This knowledge will                       extend the usefulness of these ideas in the domain of                           organometallic chemistry and also enhance their effectiveness                   in dealing with pure organic chemistry.                                                                                                                         The rates of reaction of silicon and germanium analogs of                       important intermediates in organic chemistry will be studied as                 will the preparation of new types of molecules containing                       multiple bonds to silicon.  The experiments combine the                         synthesis of new molecules with physical studies of species too                 short-lived to isolate.  Among the latter experiments are the                   generation of reactive molecules by use of nanosecond pulses of                 photons from lasers and the monitoring of these short-lived                     reactions on a time scale of picoseconds to milliseconds.",
