GEMS is a           series of thirty teacher's guides to activities that are exciting and           fun yet meet the content and process objectives of school-based science.        GEMS activities have been extensively tested and improved by classroom          teachers.  They can be used to supplement or replace existing curricula,        and require only easily accessible materials.  Dissemination will be            through orientation workshops to 2000 individual teachers and teacher           educators across the nation who already implement activity-based                materials in the classrooms or who are interested in improving the              teaching of elementary school science.",
