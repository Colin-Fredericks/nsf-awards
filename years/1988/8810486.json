 "awd_abstract_narration": "Photoreceptor cells in animal eyes contain light-absorbing                 pigments derived from compounds called chromophores.  These                     pigments are localized on densely packed layers of membrane                     within the photoreceptors.  Assembly and ongoing turnover of the                membranes and their photopigments may be crucial to features of                 vision such as light adaptation, but the role of turnover is not                yet well understood.                                                                 This project exploits special properties of the visual                     system of insects for attacking this problem.  The hawkmoth                     Manduca develops from a larval caterpillar into an adult moth; if               the larva has a diet deficient in chromophores (vitamin A-related               compounds), the adult has severely impaired vision.  Remarkably,                simply \"painting\" the adult eyes with the compounds in a special                solution has been found to partially restore visual sensitivity.                This system now will be used to assess how the chromophore is                   synthesized into photopigment, how the chromophore and membranes                interact, and how the photopigment is inserted into the membrane.               Anatomical and biochemical methods will be used to examine the                  membrane ultrastructure, the localization of the photopigments,                 and the metabolism of chromophores.  This preparation provides a                novel approach to address a central issue in vision, and will                   yield useful information on nocturnal vision in an ecologically                 important group of insects.",
