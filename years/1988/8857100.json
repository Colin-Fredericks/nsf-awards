Partial oxidation reactions are studied using catalyst                          systems based on zeolites prepared using multivalent ion-                       exchange cations such as iron, copper, or cobalt.                               Experiments are designed to determine whether, for a given                      cation-zeolite system, it is possible to alter the redox                        potential of the multivalent sites by changing the ion                          loading, the silicon/aluminum ratio, or the nature of other                     cation-exchange ions, or by framework substitution of other                     atoms for aluminum.  Catalytic kinetic studies are conducted                    using these materials with emphasis on the partial oxidation                    of methane.                                                                                                                                                     Catalytic production of carbon filaments is well studied and                    serves as the starting point for attempts to alter the                          filament-producing catalyst so that subsequently it can be                      used to catalyze the formation of a matrix around the                           filaments; this would permit formation of composites in a                       single operation.                                                               Finally, the mechanism by which rare earths promote the water-gas               shift reaction over sulfided cobalt-molybdenum catalysts is                     investigated.",
