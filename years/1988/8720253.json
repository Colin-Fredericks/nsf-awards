 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action permits Drs. Phillips and Gladfelter to complete                    archaeological excavation at four sites in the Wadi Feiran area                 of the Southern Sinai in Egypt.  They have previously conducted                 two seasons of NSF supported research in this area and located a                number of sites which cover a long span of time.  All sites date                to the Upper Paleolithic period and contain not only lithic                     remains but floral and faunal materials as well.  Analysis of                   these remains, coupled with geological work will permit the                     investigators to reconstruct the environment over the period of                 occupation and determine how the Upper Paleolithic hunters and                  gatherers utilized it.  Because several of the sites represent                  camping places, it should be possible to reconstruct the spacial                distribution of activities and gain some insight into social                    organization.                                                                                                                                                   The Upper Paleolithic period marks the appearance of anatomically               modern human beings as well as cultural elements such as art.                   Evidence seems to indicate that the transition from Neanderthal                 to modern human may have occurred in the Near East and                          archaeologists are interested in documenting this transformation                and determining the cause of it.  This research will help to                    achieve that goal.",
