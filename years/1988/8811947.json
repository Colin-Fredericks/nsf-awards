 "awd_abstract_narration": "During late oogenesis in Drosophila, ovarian follicle cells                     synthesize and secrete several proteins that assemble to form the               vitelline membrane and chorion sublayers that comprise the                      eggshell.  Our research is directed towards understanding the                   molecular mechanisms that underlie developmental regulation of                  eggshell protein synthesis and morphogenesis.  towards this end,                Dr. Waring has been studying the molecular basis of mutations                   that affect eggshell production and assembly.  This proposal is                 directed towards extending our analyses of the dec-1 locus, an                  eggshell structural gene locus that is exceptional in terms of                  its size, mutability, and ability to encode multiple products via               developmentally regulated alternative RNA processing and                        proteolytic cleavage events.  Studies in three areas are proposed               to elucidate the functional significance of these processing                    events.  First, domain-specific antibodies will be raised and                   used to identify and localize protein products of the locus                     during different stages of eggshell assembly.  Second, the use of               different RNA maturation pathways will be defined with regards to               both time and space, and insight into factors involved in splice                site selection will be sought through the analysis of processing                mutants.  Third, the functional genetic unit will be defined by                 DNA transformation experiments utilizing null mutants.  In vitro                mutagenesis methods will ben be employed to identify functional                 regions encoded within these DNA sequences.  These studies are                  expected to provide molecular insights into a morphogenetic                     pathway in a genetically accessible metazoan organism.                          %%%                                                                             This proposal is to continue a molecular genetic analysis of the                expression of eggshell proteins in the fruitfly, Drosophila.                    These genes have to be expressed  at the correct precise time and               is the correct tissues to ensure the successful development of                  the eggs for the future generation. The fruitfly provides a good                model system for studying these important developmental events                  because both molecular and genetic studies are possible with this               organism.",
