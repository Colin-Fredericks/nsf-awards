 "awd_abstract_narration": "The number of available Spectronic 20 spectrophotometers in general             chemistry is being increased from two to twelve units.  This is                 allowing all students in a full laboratory section to perform                   experiments requiring extensive measurements from these instruments.            The new instruments are allowing the curriculum to include experiments          which establish the formula of complex ions, rates of dissociation of           complexes, kinetic rate laws for the bromination of acetone, and other          appropriate quantitative experiments.  A second infrared                        spectrophotometer is also being added.  This is allowing the organic            laboratory students to increase their routine analysis of starting              materials and synthesis products.  It is also facilitating the                  introduction of infrared analysis into the general chemistry laboratory                                                                                         sections which are currently too large to be served by a single                 instruments.  An example of a new experiment, which has been added is a         study of the bonding in ligands of a cobalt (III) complex.
