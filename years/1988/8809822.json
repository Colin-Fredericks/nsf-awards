 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is part of an ambitious effort by mathematical                     economists to identify and rigorously study fundamental                         principles of individual and collective choice.  These                          principles, when applied to specific problems, take the form of                 axioms and have proved extremely powerful in providing new                      insights into the solutions to economic problems and in                         unifying the varied areas of economic theory.                                                                                                                   This project studies and characterizes solutions satisfying the                 augmentation principle an its \"dual\", the consistency                           principle.  Consistency is the property that whatever outcome                   of any subproblem where subproblem roughly means a problem                      derived from the original by considering separately a subset of                 the agents, and their resources, from the original problem.                     Augmentation works in reverse:  any solution to a problem                       should be consistent with the solution to a larger problem of                   which the given problem is a subproblem.  The principles are                    applied to the following classes of economic problems:                          bargaining, bankruptcy and taxation, cost allocation, resource                  allocation in economies with public godds.                                                                                                                      This line of basic research is important because it helps us                    understand the boundary between which combinations of social                    objectives are feasible and which are not.  For example, the                    project determines when the Lindahl correspondence, one of the                  main theoretical tools for allocation in public good economies,                 satisfies fundamental principles of social choice and develops                  precise tools for quantifying the extent to which a given                       correspondence fails to meet a given requirement.",
