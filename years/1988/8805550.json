 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid development and intensification of winter cyclones in             coastal regions presents a major weather forecasting problem.  Along            the East Coast of the United States, the development of cyclonic                storms and frontal systems often occurs along the coastal region of             the Carolinas.  These weather systems may lead to severe weather in             the heavily populated Northeast Corridor in the form of freezing rain,          heavy snowfall, blizzards and extensive coastal erosion.  A complex             interaction of cold continental air, warm ocean currents, traveling             atmospheric disturbances and local geography all appear to contribute           to the rapid development of these systems; however, the processes are           not well understood and the phenomena are often poorly forecast.                    In January-March 1986 a cooperative research project to study               winter storms in this region was held by an consortium of universities          and Federal agencies.  Entitled GALE (Genesis of Atlantic Lows                  Experiment), the project was designed to provide detailed information           on the role of air-sea interaction, planetary boundary-layer processes          and mesoscale meteorological processes.  As one of the core                     investigators of the GALE, the Principal Investigator was instrumental          in designing and executing the experiment.                                          Using the specialized data sets collected during the GALE, the              Principal Investigator will carry out a number of diagnostic studies.           The working scientific hypothesis is that the evolution of mesoscale            atmospheric structure over the land and water is influenced by the              initial large scale flow and, in turn, feeds back upon and alters the           large scale flow during the life cycle of various weather events.  The          nature and consequences of this interaction between mesoscale and               larger scale processes is one of the scientific problems that must be           addressed before substantial progress can be made in forecasting of             extreme weather events.",
