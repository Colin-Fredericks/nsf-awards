 "awd_abstract_narration": "The quality of chemistry course offerings is being improved both                in terms of coverage as well as in facilities and equipment.                    Accordingly, a complete renovation and reassessment is being made               to upgrade and improve the general and organic chemistry courses                currently offered with special emphasis on instrumentation.  The                PI is spearheading the major improvement plan.  The major                       equipment being added to the basic general and organic chemistry                laboratories includes a computer and accessories, a student model               gas chromatograph, an infrared spectrophotometer, balances, pH                  meters, a polarimeter, a Spectronic 20 as well as other minor                   items.  The introductory and organic lecture sequence is also                   being totally revised to reflect the availability of the new                    equipment.
