Eight faculty                     members will train twelve students throughout the year in modern,               experimental techniques of anatomy, biochemistry, pharmacology                  and electrophysiology for which the facility is exceptionally                   well equipped.  The students will live on the campus of the                     Laboratory, have access to all facilities, and will become full                 partners in the ongoing research efforts of their faculty                       advisors.  Their independence will be encouraged, and they will                 receive full credit for their work in publications.  In addition                to their practical research training, the students' intellectual                growth will be stimulated through participation in the                          Laboratory's regular seminars, and through a special series of                  research discussions provided by each member of the faculty.",
