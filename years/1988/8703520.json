 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an SBIR Phase II award from the 1985 solicitation.                 Many important problems in characterizing materials in the                      earth's lithosphere employ thermal analysis.  The innovation                    offered in this project is an unique system which couples                       thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) with evolved gas analysis                      (EGA) performed with a Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR)                       spectrometer.  An unique feature of the system is its ability                   to provide continuous monitoring of the infrared spectra of                     evolving liquids as well as quantitative analysis of gases.                     The FT-IR system combines all of the control and data reduction                 functions in the FT-IR's computer and thus is capable of                        providing an integrated, automated instrument with extensive                    analysis of products at a limited analysis.  The Phase I                        program emphasized the characterization of energy resources.                    In collaboration with Dr. Jean Whelan of the Woods Hole                         Oceanographic Institute, a variety of the petroleum source rock                 samples were analyzed with the TG-FTIR and the results                          correlated with data on maturity, vitrinite reflectance,                        mineral composition, organic content, and organic composition                   obtained by standard methods.  Initial results indicate that                    the TG-FTIR technique provides useful geochemical information                   related to source rock characteristics including: a)                            Independent maturation indicator,s Tmax of a number of organic                  and inorganic sediment components; b) Material balance of                       organic and inorganic sedimentary carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur;                 c) Data for classification of sedimentary organic matter into                   kerogen Types I, II, and III and depositional environment.                      Phase II will be devoted to improvements in the apparatus, in                   the methodology, in calibrations using a variety of standard                    materials and in the application technique for a variety of                     problems related to resource and pollution monitoring.",
