 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RUI project is in the general area of analytical and surface               chemistry and in the subfield of plasma diagnostics.  Radio                     frequency and direct current plasmas in silane and halogenated                  gases are used extensively for etching and depositing thin films                on semiconductors.  The understanding, control, and optimization                of these processes requires non-intrusive in situ diagnostic                    probes.  In this research activity, infrared absorption                         spectroscopy will be used to provide complementary information to               more commonly used diagnostic techniques such as laser induced                  fluorescence and optical emission spectroscopy for the                          characterization of transient polyatomic radical species typically              present in these technologically important plasmas.  The energies               of the infrared absorptions will be used to identify the species                present and the corresponding intensities of the absorptions will               be used to determine their concentrations.  Data obtained from                  these experiments will be used to model chemical events within the              plasmas that are of importance to surface etching and deposition                processes as well as to combustion chemistry.                                                                                                                   To achieve the goals of this research, a tunable infrared laser                 will be used to measure the high resolution spectra of significant              plasma-generated radicals such as SiF3, SiCl2, SiH2, HSiF, and                  Si2H4.  Initially the radicals will be generated in a radio                     frequency or direct current plasma contained in a multipass cell.               Frequency, Zeeman, and concentration modulation will be employed                to improve the minimum detectability and to differentiate the                   radical spectra from those of stable molecules.  Following                      analysis of the spectra, a plasma reactor that simulates the                    conditions encountered in the manufacture of semiconductor devices              will be built and the radical concentrations, spatial                           distributions, and rotational, vibrational, and translational                   temperatures will be measured as functions of external plasma                   parameters.  These measurements should then enable the development              of a model for the chemical reactions that take place in these                  plasmas and should also establish infrared absorption spectroscopy              as a powerful plasma diagnostic.",
