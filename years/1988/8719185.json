 "awd_abstract_narration": "The construction of ring compounds occupies an important                    position in synthetic organic chemistry. Under the Organic and                  Macromolecular Chemistry Program, this project is studying a                    novel reaction which very efficiently constructs six-membered                   rings containing an important functional group. This                            methodology will be employed to synthesize a series of natually                 occurring compounds.                                                                                                                                                The participation of alpha, beta-unsaturated isocyanates in                 \u01314+2! cycloaddition-like reactions with a variety of                            dienophilic partners including:  enamines, vinyl ethers, silyl                  enol ethers, and benzynes is under study.  The basic validity                   of the proposition has been established with the successful                     cycloaddition of several functionalized cyclohexenyl                            isocyanates and certain enamines, enolates and benzyne.                                                                                                         The fundamental methodology is expanded to include the                          construction of a number of potentially useful functionalized                   octahydrophenanthridine species.  In addition, further                          exploitation of the chemistry for the elaboration of several                    examples of the amaryllidaceae alkaloids is planned.  The                       fundamental strategy exploits the potential for construction of                 the phenanthridine nucleus of the alkaloids in essentially one                  operation using appropriately functionalized vinyl isocyanates                  in \u01314+2! cycloaddition type reactions.  The strategy will also                  be used to construct several pyridone containing fungal                         metabolites.",
