 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bark and ambrosia beetles (families Scolytidae and                         Patypodidae) are among the most destructive of insect pests.                    Nearly 60 percent of all natural tree mortality in the United                   States is caused either directly or indirectly by members of                    these families, including southern pine beetles, mountain pine                  beetles, western pine beetles and dutch elm disease (carried by                 the European elm bark beetle).                                                       Although more than 20,000 scientific articles have been                    written on these insects and the problems they cause, this                      literature is scattered and difficult to locate.  The only                      existing index to this literature was written in 1910, when only                one-fifth of the currently recognized species were known.  A new                bibliography containing references to this literature has been                  completed by Dr. Stephen Wood and will be published in late 1987.                    This project will support production of an index to the                    literature cited in Wood's bibliography.  The index will greatly                accelerate the speed and efficiency with which researchers can                  locate and use published sources and it will greatly enhance the                thoroughness of their review of the literature.  Curators of                    insect collections, entomologists and foresters concerned with                  the identification of pest species of bark and ambrosia beetles                 will greatly appreciate the updated scientific names and                        classifications presented in the catalog as well as the                         literature citations that apply to each species.  The index                     should save thousands of hours of valuable research time annually               for at least two or three decades.                                                   Dr. Wood is the only living world authority on bark and                    ambrosia beetles.  He has worked on their taxonomy and behavior                 for over 40 years.  Library and computer facilities at Brigham                  Young University are excellent.",
