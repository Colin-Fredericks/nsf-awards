 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many mental health professionals and social scientists have                     claimed that empathy plays an important role in social and                      moral life--that the individual who feels another's distress or                 feels sympathy for a distressed or needy other will be more                     likely to assist the distressed person and less likely to harm                  him/her.  At the present time, however, the empirical research                  is not entirely supportive of these assumptions.  This failure                  may be due in part to the use of some indices of empathy that                   have questionable validity.  Moreover, very little is known                     about how individuals develop a predisposition to respond                       sympathetically.  Thus, the purposes of the present research                    are to use multiple methods to assess and differentiate various                 modes of affective responding that relate to empathy and                        sympathy and to examine the socialization antecedants of                        empathic responding.  The investigators will examine age-                       related changes in the expression of empathy/sympathy and how                   the various indices of empathy relate to prosocial behavior.                    Specifically, in studies with people aged 4-5 years to                          adulthood, three types of measures of emotional responding will                 be used:  self-report measures (e.g., verbal or written                         responses to specific questions), changes in facial                             expressions, and changes in physiological responsiveness (i.e.,                 changes in heart rate and skin conductance).  Facial and                        physiological indices are included because they may be less                     influenced than self report indices by individuals' conscious                   desire to present themselves in a positive light, and because                   young children may have difficulty reporting their emotional                    reactions.  Moreover, these measures will be used in settings                   that are more naturalistic than those laboratory settings used                  in past research.  Finally, the investigators will examine                      parental socialization practices with regard to emotionality                    (i.e., how parents deal with emotions in the home, how they                     talk about emotions, and how they handle their children's                       expression of emotions) and the relation of these practices to                  children's emotional responsiveness. Thus, this research                        program has important practical as well as important scientific                 value. The research may help us identify important parenting                    practices that are related to the development of prosocial                      behaviors in children.  Moreover, the use of multiple measures                  in the research allows us to explore a variety of methods that                  can be used to distinguish among various types of empathic                      responding and how these are theoretically and empirically                      related to the development of positive modes of behavior.",
