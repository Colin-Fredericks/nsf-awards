 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research focuses on several topics in Integer Programming          with the objective of advancing our understanding of the underlying             mathematics of some combinatorial optimization problems.  The                   importance of the research lies on the fact that significant advances           on the understanding of the mathematics associated with these problems          yield improvements in the capacity of solving large scale problems,             that typically arise in real world applications.  The techniques to be          used are the ones typical of Integer Programming and Polyhedral                 Combinatorics.  More specifically, the PI's will investigate                    structural propertiese of 0.1 matrices whose associated set packing             polytope has integer extreme points.  They also intend to continue              investigations on the facial structure of some polytopes associated             with some packing or covering problems.  Algorithmic issues related to          optimization problems on circuits of binary matroids will also be               studied.                                                                                                                                                        Professors Rao and Conforti are well known researchers in                       combinatorial optimization and are well qualified to achieve success            in this research.  New York University is a suitable environment for            the study.  An award is recommended at the revised budget level for             two years.",
