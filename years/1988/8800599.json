 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central focus in science, technology and society studies                      examines uses of science and scientific tools in societal and                   organizational decision-making.  These are situations where                     values have important influence, particularly in areas of                       scientific complexity and uncertainty.  Global change represents                a new area of scientific study, directed at predicting the                      effects of natural processes and human technology on the                        biosphere.  The complexity and urgency surrounding the                          development of this field and application of its findings makes                 it an important area to study.  This project will examine two                   global change/earth system science cases:  carbon dioxide and                   ozone.  It will explore the nature and implications of the                      developing scientific understanding of these phenomena, with                    particular attention to the values and evidence that ground                     scientific assumptions, methods, and findings.  The study will                  proceed in six stages:  collection of pertinent literature and                  identification of key participants; evaluation and analysis of                  key issues from key documents; isolation, evaluation and analysis               of issues with respect to carbon dioxide and ozone; development                 and administration of questionnaires and interviews of key                      informants; analysis of findings with respect to the two cases;                 and presentation and publication of results.                                                                                                                    This project addresses a very important issue.  The principal                   investigator and consultant are very well qualified;                            institutional support is very good; collaborative efforts are                   likely to continue beyond the period of this award; results are                 likely to be appropriately disseminated and useful.  An award in                the amount of $54,327 is therefore recommended.",
