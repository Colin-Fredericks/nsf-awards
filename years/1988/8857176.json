 "awd_abstract_narration": "The P. element transposon of Drosophila melanogaster is of                      importance for transformation of the fruitfly but is also of                    intrinsic interest as a biological phenomenon.  It has been                     described at the molecular and genetic level by several                         laboratories.  The transposon moves only in somatic cells                       although it is present in germ line cells.  The answer to                       that mystery was found to lie in the processing of the                          transcript.  The transcript contains three introns and in                       somatic cells, all three are processed out to form a mature                     mRNA.  In germ line cells, one of the introns is not                            processed out and the mature message is not completed.  The                     present study is directed towards understanding the genetic                     control of P. element transposition using an integrated                         approach utilizing genetics, biochemistry and molecular                         biology.  An attempt will be made to develop an in vitro                        system in order to study the biochemical mechanism of                           transposition as well as the factors involved with                              differential splicing events.                                                                                                                                   This study should result in greater insights into gene                          regulation at the cellular and genetic levels.",
