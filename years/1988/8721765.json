 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to provide an improved method            of grinding anti-friction bearing outer and inner race rings at                 lower cost but of higher quality.  Current production practice                  requires an external grinding machine to grind the outside diameter             (OD) or raceway, and an internal grinding machine to grind the                  inside diameter (ID) or internal raceway.  This study seeks a method            of grinding the OD and ID on one grinding machine, thereby                      eliminating the tooling cost, setup, maintenance, and capital                   required for one grinding machine.  This method focuses on a device             for securely holding and driving the thin-walled rings without                  distortion while providing access for the OD and ID grinding wheels             to grind the OD and the ID of the bearing ring.  This project covers            a study of the out-of-roundness produced by asymmetrical rigidity in            the clamping system.  In addition, the propagation of initial stock             runout to cause roundness errors in the finished bearing ring when              grinding with fast, high-production cycles will be investigated.                     The work-holding and driving method coupled with force-                    adaptive control, using force sensors, provides a means for                     improving grinding performance and reducing production costs in the             antifriction bearing industry.",
