David Riley, The Home Office,               London, England; Hans Klette, University of Lund, Sweden; and Wolf              Middendorff, Max Planck Institute for Foreign and International                 Criminal Law, and Gunter Kroj, Federal Highway Research Institute,              Cologne, both from the Federal Republic of Germany.  They will                  attempt to test the validity of general deterrence theory in                    preventing alcohol-impaired driving in three countries in Western               Europe and the United States.                                                                                                                                   General deterrence itself cannot be measured directly, so indirect              methods will be used to assess its effects.  Dr. Snortum has devised            a method of \"contextual analysis\" to measure the complex of                     cultural, legal, moral, and social variables that impinge on drivers            in drinking-driving situations.  The researchers will determine the             relative influence of legal threat, moral commitment, and respect               for formal law in preventing deterrence in the study countries.  The            research will also determine the legal origins and empirical impact             of laws concerning blood alcohol limits for drivers in the                      countries.  Each of the researchers has already contributed to                  understanding these issues and this award will help bring them                  together for concerted scientific effort in dealing with a serious              social problem.",
