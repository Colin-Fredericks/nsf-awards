 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Kleene proposes to study the mechanisms that control the                replacement of histones by transition proteins and protamines during            spermatogenesis in the mouse.  One major goal is to determine the amino         acid sequences of the primary translation products for all the                  transition proteins in the mouse from the sequences of cDNA clones.             Another goal is to elucidate the mechanisms which repress the                   translation of the mRNAs for the transition proteins and protamines in          round spermatids, and activate their translation in elongating                  spermatids.  The critical question here--whether the translation of             these mRNAs is repressed by mRNP proteins or by structural elements of          the RNA itself--will be answered by comparing the translational                 efficiencies of mRNPs and deproteinized mRNAs from the polysomal and            nonpolysomal fractions of the testis in cell free translation systems.          To search for structural elements that may be involved in translational         regulation, the complete nucleotide sequences of the mRNAs for two              transition proteins and both protamines will be compared.  UV                   crosslinking will be employed to identify mRNP proteins in polysomal and        non-polysomal fractions of the testis.  This proposal is intended to            introduce promising undergraduates to research in molecular biology.                The differentiation of the sperm nucleus is a simple developmental          system involving the interaction of a small number of abundant,                 structural proteins with DNA.  It is an excellent system in which to            study the development of a specialized structure and translational              regulation in mammals.",
