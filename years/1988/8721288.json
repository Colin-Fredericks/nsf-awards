 "awd_abstract_narration": "The role which tropical-extratropical interaction plays in                 the irregular oscillations of the large scale circulation                       remains controversial.  There is synoptic evidence that a                       characteristic sequence of tropical and extratropical events                    accompanies both quasi-regular intraseasonal oscillations of the                circulation and the development of persistent circulation                       regimes.  This research will investigate the nature of some known               composite relationships between tropical convection and the mid-                latitude jets through 1) analyzing the annual cycle of these                    features in detail with high temporal resolution and 2) using a                 case study approach to the intraseasonal and interannual                        variability of these connections.                                                                                                                               Multi-level, twice daily National Meteorological Center (NMC)                   data from July 1976 to July 1987 will be used to define the                     circulation and its fluctuations.  Outgoing longwave radiation                  data will be used to infer tropical convection fluctuations.  The               quality of the divergence field in the NMC data will be evaluated               through correlations with the OLR data at different time and                    space scales.                                                                                                                                                   Primary emphasis will be placed on the relationship between 1)                  the jet stream and its associated ageostrophic flow and 2)                      tropical convection and its associated divergent flow.                                                                                                               This research is important because in order to make useful                 predictions of weather and climate feature over the US weeks to                 seasons in advance the processes studied here, that is the                      interactions between tropical and extra-tropical circulations,                  must be better understood.",
