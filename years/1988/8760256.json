 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dynamic seal performance can be improved by favorably controlling the           fluid pressure between the two sliding surfaces.  Favorable control             of fluid pressure in the mixed friction regime can lead to reduce               gross wear and reduce friction.  In traditional design the detail of            the mixed friction lubrication is left to the inherent                          characteristics of the materials themselves.  By altering material              properties in a pattern over the surface area to some depth, it is              possible to produce surface which have wear depths and/or surface               characteristic variations which correspond to these patterns. These             patterns of varying effective film thickness can be used to enhance             mixed friction lubrication.  Such differential wear may be stable               even with significant amounts of gross wear, thus ensuring a                    continuation of the benefits on pressure distribution, grosswear, and           friction.",
