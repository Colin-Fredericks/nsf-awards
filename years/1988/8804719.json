 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the causes for variations in population                   growth between different societies in the Caribbean.                            Households in Santa Lucia and Antigua will be surveyed to study                 the reasons for high and low family sizes,using a survey                        questionnaire that has been used to study similar issues in                     Barbados.   The hypothesis tested is that women have fewer                      children when they are freed from financial dependence on their                 children in their old age, and that this independence comes                     from changes in the educational sytem and occupational                          structure.  This research is important because understanding                    the causes of high population growth will help us to control                    it; and the general theory of the changes from high to low                      population growth must be tested against local circumstances to                 discover its strengths and weaknesses.  The islands of the                      Caribbean represent a natural laboratory of similar but                         different societies in which to test the theory.",
