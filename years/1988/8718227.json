 "awd_abstract_narration": "When DNA molecules are injected into Xenopus oocyte                             nuclei,they recombine with each other, provided certain                         conditions are met.  These include requirements that the DNAs                   be linear and that sequence homologies be available to                          support the recombination events.  This proposal suggests                       continuing studies of the mechanism of recombination in                         oocyte.  First,the rules of oocyte recombination will be                        investigated by injection of modified and marked DNA                            substrates; some of these will be designed to test specific                     models of genetic recombination.  Second, intermediates in                      the recombination process will be characterized by isolation                    of DNA at short times after injection and by use of specific                    inhibitors. Third, efforts will be made to develop a                            cell-free recombination system from the oocyte.  This will                      allow characterization of individual steps in the                               recombination process and purification of components which                      catalyze them. The overall goal is to provide a mechanistic                     and biochemical description of recombination processes in                       oocytes.                                                                                                                                                        Recombination of DNA molecules resulting in chromosome                          exchange is a basic genetic process in most eukaryotic cells.                   While a few of the parameters in some cell types are known,                     much remains to be investigated.  This investigation into the                   mechanics of DNA recombination in Xenopus oocyte nuclei                         should expand our knowledge of the critical factors in the                      recominbational process.  Such knowledge is important for                       genetic engineering to progress.",
