 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will attempt to measure the isotropy of the cosmic                 microwave background radiation (CMBR) from South Pole Station.                  The measurements will be made by two different instruments working              at different angular size scales and frequencies and using                      different detection techniques.  One of the instruments will make               measurements on an angular scale of 20 minutes at a frequency of                90 GHz using a bolometer detector.  The other instrument will                   measure angular scales of 4 degrees at a frequency of 19 GHz using              a ruby maser detector.                                                                                                                                          The instruments have the sensitivity to set new upper limits on                 the anisotropy of the CMBR, and if they do so it will be necessary              to reformulate the current cosmological theories.  A detection of               anisotropy would be an important confirmation of the current                    theories.                                                                                                                                                       This is probably the most important cosmological measurement that               can be made, and the South Pole is the best place on earth to make              it.                                                                                                                                                             The institution and the proposer are outstandingly qualified to                 perform the experiment.  The proposer has developed the                         instruments with funding from a Presidential Young Investigator                 grant especially awarded for that purpose.",
