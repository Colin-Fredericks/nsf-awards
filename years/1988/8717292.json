 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of bioelectrochemistry.  This award               will provide funds for the purchase of a video enhanced                         microscope with which Professor Ewing can perform some truly                    innovative experiments in bioelectrochemistry.  Specifically,                   this young investigator will employ the video enhanced microscope               to optically visualize synaptic junctions between cultured                      neurons to perform the first in vivo measurement of                             neurotransmitter release from a single synaptic bouton.  Success                in these experiments would demonstrate the electrochemist's                     ability to make measurements at the same cellular level that the                bioscientist thinks in terms of.  This achievement would                        represent an important milestone in bioelectrochemistry and its                 possibility has been facilitated by this investigator's advances                in microelectrode fabrication and neuronal cell culture                         experiments.                                                                                                                                                    The ability to perform analytical voltammetry wholly within                     synaptic gaps will enable the identification of catecholaminergic               neurotransmitters by voltammetry and, therefore, by cell type.                  Additionally, this new experimental capability will permit                      correlation of neuronal stimulation type and strength with                      neurotransmitter release from a single neuron.  This research                   could lead to procedures for identifying and characterizing                     cultured neurons as well as new fundamental insights into                       neuronal communication.",
