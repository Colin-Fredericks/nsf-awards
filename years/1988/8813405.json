 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electronic power switching devices are known to create power line               disturbances through the generation of harmonics, subharmonics,                 fractional harmonics and other non-periodic voltage and current                 spikes.  Most voltage and current irregularities which result in a              departure from the sinusoidal steady-state, 60 Hz wave form cause               detrimental effects to the end users' equipment as well as to                   distribution system operation and safety components.                                                                                                            A method for modeling the propagation and attenuation of harmonic               energy in the distriubtion system is the focal point of this research           project.  Experiments using a scaled-down network will confirm the              accuracy and versatility of the modeling techniques.  Understanding             the phenomenon of harmonic current and voltage behavior will play an            important role in developing algorithms for the decoupling of the               harmonics from the fundamental power system frequency.                                                                                                          This research will foster an open-minded attitude towards new solid-            state switching technologies, but at the same time will make sure that          the present-day power quality of distribution feeders will not                  deteriorate.",
