 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project GEO provides a support network, requisite concepts, and                 curriculum materials so that middle grade teachers from six rural               northern Vermont communities will improve their teaching of earth               science. The project addresses the special needs of this group of               teachers, many of whom lack training in science and who, due to                 location, have limited opportunities for professional                           development.                                                                                                                                                    Participating teachers will attend a graduate-level Earth                       Science/Curriculum Development workshop which will provide earth                science concepts, hands-on activities, field trips, and                         instructional techniques.  Particiapnts will receive: (1) a                     general rock and mineral collection; (2) regionally-specific rock               and mineral specimens; (3) local geologic and topographic maps                  and field trip guides; (4) field collecting equipment; (5) Earth                Science Handbook; and (6) Curriculum Guide, all locally developed               by the staff of the project. Lecture, discussion, laboratory work               and field trips will be scheduled throughout the workshop.                      Principals will join teachers for the orientation and the first                 two days of instruction so that they will be familiar with the                  material covered.  This involvement by principals should                        facilitate the curricular changes that will result as a                         consequence of this program and provide the administrative                      support for the development of a good earth science course                      complete with laboratory activities and field trips.                                                                                                            During the year following the course, teachers will receive three               follow-up visits at their schools from thje Project GEO Support                 Network.  This Network consists of Johnsons State College faculty               in Science and Education, VT Department of Education, State                     Geologist's Office, VT Natural Resources Council, VT Geological                 Society and VT Institute of Natural Science.  Reunion conferences               in the winter and spring will allow participants to share their                 experiences and provide feedback.",
