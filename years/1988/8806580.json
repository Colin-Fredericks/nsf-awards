 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Equipment Grant is provided to build a facility for the                    synthesis of thin films of new oxide superconductors. Two major                 problems in the synthesis of thin films are:  the ability to control            the stoichiometry of the film, and the ability to incorporate enough            oxygen.  So far thin films have been synthesized by using a large               oxygen background pressure in conventional e-beam and sputtering                chambers.  All these films require a high temperature oxygen anneal,            hence, making them less practical for applications requiring                    compatibility with other thin film devices.  This thin film facility            is designed to provide a large rate of oxygen arrival at the                    substrate, preferably in an atomic state, while maintaining the metal           sources and their rate monitors at low pressures.  This makes the               deposition rates more stable and reproducible, and extends the                  lifetime of the sources.  This facility will be used to produce high            quality films at the lowest process temperatures, and the films will            be used for tunneling, transport measurements and devices.",
