 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is for the study of structure of surfaces using               the technique of reflection electron microscopy.  The objective                 of the study is twofold:  to further develop the technique, which               was originally developed by the PI, i.e., to better understand                  the nature of the information provided by reflection electron                   microscopy (REM) in terms of atomic structures and defects, and                 to apply the technique to several technically interesting                       materials-crystal surfaces, III-V compounds, and interfaces.  The               approach thus is both to apply the REM technique to materials                   with known surface structure and defects, and to explore the                    potential of this relatively novel technique for providing                      information on the surface structure of a variety of interesting                materials.                                                                           The results should be of both scientific interest, in the                  development of a new tool for surface analysis, and of practical                interest, in providing information on the structural features on                the surfaces of several technically important materials.  The                   results should be relevant to both electronic applications, where               the surface properties dominate many device properties, and in                  the areas of sintering, catalysis and crystal growth, where                     surface effects are also critical in determining the nature of                  the final material or in its performance.",
