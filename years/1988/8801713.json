 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary cell wall of higher plants is a focal point for                     growth regulation and disease resistance.  This wall is a cell                  organelle; it has structural integrity, enzymic autonomy, and                   self-organizing properties.  This research focuses on one set of                macromolecules, the extensins, which, because of their location,                shape, chemistry and especially their tacticity (orderliness),                  may play a crucial role as organizers by virture of their ability               to form highly ordered crosslinked networks that mechanically                   couple the cellulose load-bearing polymers.  Previous work                      demonstrated extensin peptide periodicity and isodityrosine as a                short intramolecular link; identified a putative crosslink                      domain; and purified a cell wall enzyme, extensin peroxidase,                   which specifically crosslinks extensin monomers in vitro.                                                                                                       This project will define both the properties of extensin                        peroxidase and its product, the extensin network.  In particular                it will define substrate specificity to identify the minimum                    structure required for crosslinking.                                                                                                                            The work supported by this grant continues a long term effort to                understand the role of one type of protein in the primary cell                  walls of plants.  The PI has proposed a \"warp-weft\" model for                   cell wall structure based on the idea that the structural protein               extension mechanically couples the load-bearing cellulosic                      polymers.",
