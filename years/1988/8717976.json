 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will investigate the ability of                   commonly-used poisons and preservatives to prevent alteration                   and decomposition of organic matter collected in sediment                       traps.  In-situ experiments will be conducted under conditions                  which represent both coastal and open ocean areas, periods of                   maximum high and low productivity, and oxic and anoxic                          environments.  The experiments will test the ability of                         different poisons/preservatives to prevent compositional                        changes of organic matter in sediment traps and will provide                    fundamental information on the relative decomposition rates of                  individual compounds and compound classes, specifically                         contrasting terrigenous and marine material in oxic and anoxic                  basins.                                                                                 Two major questions will be addressed:  1) what is the                  effectiveness of various poisons and preservatives on the                       composition of organic matter collected in sediment traps; and                  2) what is the extent of decomposition or preservation of the                   major classes of biogenic compounds?  The approach to answering                 these questions will be to determine concentrations of organic                  compounds (lipids, sugars, amino acids, pigments, and lignin                    oxidation products) in sediment traps which have been                           unpoisoned or which have been treated with HgC12, NaN3,                         chloroform, salt gradient, formalin, or antibiotics.  Field                     experiments will be conducted in Dabob Bay, Washington, during                  low and high productivity, in Saanich Inlet, British Columbia,                  in oxic and anoxic waters, and at the time-series Station \"S\"                   off Bermuda.",
