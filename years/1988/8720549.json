 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding is requested for a fundamental research effort in the                   nature of seismological parameters controlling generation and                   propagation of far-field, i.e., transoceanic tsunamis.                                                                                                          Specifically, we plan to carry out the following research: (i)                  develop a mantle magnitude Mm based on the measurement of Rayleigh              waves at the very long but variable periods, in order to make                   feasible the one-station measurement of the seismic moment of a                 teleseismic earthquake in real time thereby providing adequate                  information for the possible issuance of tsunami warnings; (ii)                 research systematically the influence of a number  of source                    parameters such as depth of focus, geometry of focal mechanism,                 geometry of rupture, etc., on the excitation of tsunamis by                     earthquake sources; we will focus primarily on the influence of                 crustal structure, and in particular of the presence of                         sedimentary layering, as well as on the effect of non-double-                   couple sources such as those involved in landslides and volcanic                processes; (iii) use detailed rupture models to synthetize the                  tsunamis of individual earthquakes, including the so-called                     \"tsunami earthquakes\", whose tsunamis as much as 10 times greater               than predicted from their seismic moments; and (iv) research the                focusing and defocusing effects that variations in oceanic depth                creates through lateral heterogeneity in tsunami velocities, and                consequently refraction of tsunami rays.                                                                                                                        The proposed research constitutes a broad attempt at understanding              the factors controlling the amplitude of the tsunami at its                     generation, and during its propagation, before run-up and                       resonance effects ass their final contribution to the amplitude                 measured at a tidal gauge station.",
