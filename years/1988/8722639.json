 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of atomic spectroscopy.  The goal                 of this experimental activity is the enhancement of the                         sensitivity, precision, accuracy, and degree of utility of atomic               spectrometric analysis.  To this end, three thrusts are being                   pursued.  First, techniques that were developed by Professor                    Hieftje under NSF grant CHE-8320053 are being employed to                       elucidate the mechanism of solute particle vaporization and atom                formation in flames and plasmas of the type used for multielement               analysis.  Clarification of these events can be expected to reduce              interelement interferences caused by incomplete vaporization.  In               a second thrust, rare-gas plasmas are being studied in an effort                to determine how they are responsible for excitation of atoms and               ions introduced into them.  Particular emphasis is being placed                 upon understanding the characteristics of electrons in such                     discharges and the role that the electrons play in transferring                 plasma energy to analyte atoms and ions.  Finally, fundamental                  investigations that are aimed at a better understanding of how                  interferences arise in plasma-source mass spectrometry are being                pursued.                                                                                                                                                        In aggregate, these studies should give rise to improved atomic                 spectroscopic methods of analysis and a better understanding of                 fundamental processes that take place in rare-gas plasmas.  This,               in turn, should enable the broader, more efficient use of the                   inductively coupled plasma as a source element in chemical                      instrumentation.",
