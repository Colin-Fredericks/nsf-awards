 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to North Carolina State University will fund the                purchase of a small computer necessary for the effective                        participation of Dr. Sisco (the co-PI) in a collaborative research              project with David Hoisington and Ed Coe at the University of                   Missouri (NSF 8721921). The project will continue and expand                    collaborative research aimed at producing an integrated physical                and genetic map of maize.  Genetic mapping strategies of several                types will be used to identify and correlate the positions of RFLP              markers, cytological markers (knobs, deletions, insertions and                  inversions), biochemical markers (mutations responsible for                     isozymes) and other, conventional markers.  Although a substantial              amount of positional information for these various types of                     markers is now available, relatively little has been done to                    correlate the map of cytological markers with that of the                       biochemical ones, the RFLP map with the cytological map and so on.              Particular focus is placed on the newly developed technique of                  RFLP mapping because the map is not yet complete, and because no                single lab has yet assembled a complete set of RFLP marker DNAs                 that are available to all researchers.  Although the research will              be performed principally by Drs. Coe and Hoisington, collaboration              with other corn geneticists, especially those skilled in the                    identification of biochemical markers, is required.  Thus, small                concurrent awards are being made to these investigators at North                Carolina State, as well as others at Illinois State University and              Iowa State.  These awards will provide laboratory equipment and                 computers that will facilitate analysis and comparison of data                  developed in the separate labs and will insure that research                    materials developed by each investigator will be readily                        accessible to all the collaborators.                                                 Traditionally, techniques for genetic mapping have been a                  useful tool for researchers interested in a variety of basic                    questions in biology as well as for plant and animal breeders.                  The recent development of a powerful new technique called RFLP                  mapping will have a significant effect on the ease with which                   genetics can be brought to bear on both basic and applied                       problems.  However, it is important that the knowledge and tools                of the more traditional techniques be preserved and that they be                integrated (or correlated) with the new RFLP maps.  This is                     particularly true in the case of corn, which has been the subject               of extensive genetic study.  The proposed collaborative research                will accelerate the development of a complete RFLP map of corn and              will insure that the map is a tool available to all researchers                 and agronomists.  Moreover, by facilitating the integration of the              RFLP data with that obtained with other types of genetic markers,               the research will insure that the RFLP map is of maximum utility                for those who need it.",
