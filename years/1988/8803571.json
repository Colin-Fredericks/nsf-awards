 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Field Laboratory Air Transportable Systems (FLATS)                       program consists of three phases.  The first Phase will evaluate                the needs (present and future) of scientists who wish to engage                 in research in areas remote from existing fixed science                         facilities in Antarctica.  The second Phase consists of study                   and evaluation of existing transpotable modules that could                      support such scientific investigations.  Such transportable                     facilities may be presently be in use in government or private                  industry or may be described in published information on                        proposed structures (for example, in proposals for habitats to                  support space-based research and colonization).  An option of a                 third Phase would allow for the creation of uniquely designed                   modules for the U.S. Antarctic Program if adequate existing                     designs cannot be found.                                                                                                                                           During the course of negotiation with the contractor, it was                 determined that Phase I would be funded with FY 1988 funds;                     Phase II would come out of FY 1989 funds.  Funding of FY III                    will be contingent on the results of the initial two Phases.",
