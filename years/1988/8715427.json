 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thermal desorption from single crystals is normally performed                   under radically different conditions from thermal desorption from               supported metals.  In order to make direct comparisons, methods                 are being developed for measuring thermal desorption from the two               forms of metal under identical conditions of pressure and                       temperature.  Knudsen effusion cells are used to measure thermal                desorption from single crystals under relatively high pressure.                 Also being investigated is desorption from supported metals                     directly into ultrahigh vacuum.  Previous single-crystal studies                have shown that thermal desorption of carbon monoxide is                        sensitive to metal surface structure; the techniques developed                  here may permit this fact to be used to identify surface                        structures on supported metals.  Initially, the platinum-group                  metals are studied.                                                                                                                                             Nanometer-sized metal structures on the surface of support                      materials have important applications in microelectronics and in                catalysis.  Several methods are available to measure bulk                       composition and structure of such small structures, but most                    surface analysis methods lack the resolution needed for this                    scale.  This project develops techniques that provide information               on surface conformations in very small metal particles.",
