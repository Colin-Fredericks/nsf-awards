 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ceramics are valuable because they can withstand heat and                       chemical attack. They have a critical drawback--they are brittle,               do not deform under load and therefore crack or break easily.                   Flaws in their structure cause this cracking, therefore much                    effort in ceramic research is aimed at developing new processing                techniques that minimize microscopic flaws.  When the material is               produced in the form of fine fibers, the brittleness properties                 are greatly improved because the probability that a sample of                   material will contain a flaw large enough to cause brittle                      failure deceases as the sample size is reduced.  Also, if one                   fiber in a bundle fails, the crack cannot propagate further and                 the other fibers remain intact.                                                                                                                                 Composites harness the fiber's attractive properties and                        eliminate their drawbacks by imbedding them in the matrix of                    another material.  For use in high temperature applications,                    these fibers are often imbedded in metal matrices along with the                temperature resistance, reinforcing fiber and the metal's                       ductility lends added usefulness to the composite.  Light                       metals--aluminum, magnesium and titanium--are common matrices.                                                                                                  Silicon carbide (SiC) fibers are promising for reinforcing                      because of their high intrinsic strength, stiffness, high                       temperature stability, and excellent oxidation resistance.  Boron               carbide (B4C), titanium-diboride (TiB2), titanium carbide (TiC),                and titanium bromide (TiB) fibers also have potential to use                    chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to manufacture SiC, B4C, TiC and                TiB fibers.  The CVD process involves the information of a solid                by a heated substrate.  Typically, a small-diameter substrate                   wire is run through a glass reaction tube, and suitable gases are               introduced.  The substrate is resistance heated causing the gas                 to react and deposit in the heating wore.  A key problem of                     efficient manufacturing batch to continuous flow systems,                       scale-up of the laboratory continuous system to a pilot plant                   unit, modeling and simulation of the CVD reactions and securing                 cheap sources of precursors necessary for the CVD process.                      The PI will do both experimental and modeling work to study the                 effect of:                                                                           (1)  Pretreatment of the substrate fiber by hydrogen, steam                          and nitric acid on deposition rate, strength, toughness                         and adhesivity.                                                            (2)  The purity of the material on the mechanical quality of                         the fiber.                                                                 (3)  Gas flow rate on the rate of deposition.                                   (4)  Hydrogen to silane ratio and temperature on the                                 formation of stoichiometric SiC.                                           (5)  BC13, hydrocarbon (CH4/CC14) and H2 concentrations on                           the deposition of B4C.                                                     (6)  The ratio of C to Ti fed for production of TiC.                                                                                                       Detailed kinetic study experiments will be carried out in a batch               reactor to determine kinetic parameters such as reaction control                regimes, activation energy, etc.  This will be used in the design               of the larger scale continuous units.",
