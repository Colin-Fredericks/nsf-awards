 "awd_abstract_narration": "The two main areas of plasma chemistry are low pressure (cold)                  and high pressure (thermal) plasma chemistry.  The application of               cold plasma chemistry technologies was responsible for the recent               revolution in micro-electronics.  The use of thermal plasmas                    offers the possibility to develop new materials with unique                     properties or to process existing materials in a better and/or                  more efficient manner.  A large number of opportunities exist for               the possible development of thermal plasma technologies on an                   industrial scale.  Recent examples are diamond thin films and                   high temperature super-conductors.  Major research efforts are                  underway in many countries, including the United States, Canada,                Japan, Europe, and the U.S.S.R.                                                                                                                                 The Tenth Gordon Conference on Plasma Chemistry in Tilton, New                  Hampshire (August 15-19, 1988), will bring together about 135 of                the world's leading scientists in the area of plasma chemistry to               discuss recent progress in this area.  These meetings are of                    major importance for continued progress in the understanding of                 the fundamental concepts as well as the possible future                         applications of plasma chemistry.  This meeting will have                       attendees from universities, industry, and government to                        accelerate the technology transitions of plasma chemistry.",
