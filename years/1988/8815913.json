 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports experimental and                            theoretical work on atomic scattering by Dr. James Bayfield of                  the Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of                          Pittsburgh, and Dr. S.C. Roy of the Department of Physics,                      Bose Institute, Calcutta, India.  A new body of theory                          explaining atomic scattering has recently developed because of                  the availability of results from new sensitive detectors.                       There is now need to test these theoretical concepts by                         experimentation.  The results of these experiments will be of                   practical use in the application of radioisotopes for                           imaging.  The collaborative nature of the work is well                          integrated with most of the experimental work carried out in                    India by Dr. Roy and the theoretical work conducted in the                      U.S. by Dr. Bayfield.                                                                                                                                           Scope:  This project meshes the strengths of an Indian and                      U.S. scientist to address a problem of fundamental scientific                   importance that has immediate practical application.  The                       project nicely meets the objectives of the U.S.-India                           Cooperative Program by supporting good science and encouraging                  scientific collaboration between U.S. and Indian                                investigators.",
