 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intersecting waveguides are a natural waveguide element for integrated          optics.  As a passive element, they can be used as optical cross-               connects between devices in an integrated optical circuit.  The                 geometry can serve as a power splitter for broadcast circuits.  Of              greater interest is its potential as an optical crosspoint switch.              Unfortunately, current theoretical analysis has been able to explain            only the most trivial of experimental observations.  In response to             this develop a rigorous analytic method based on multiple scattering            between waveguides.                                                                                                                                             Theoretical analysis will be extended to examine optical intersecting           waveguide devices incorporating the electro-optic and higher order              nonlinear effects.  Electro-optic devices will include switches,                switch arrays, modulators, and tunable wavelength filters.  The                 analysis will be followed by design and fabrication of these devices            in LiNbo3.                                                                                                                                                      The intersecting waveguide geometry should also be ideal for                    fabricating guided wave all-optical non linear devices, including               switches and optically bistable devices.  The feasibility of                    incorporating the intersecting waveguide structure into a medium with           reasonable third order nonlinearity will be examined.  It is our                intention to incorporate these results into a guided wave device,               using as a substrate either semiconductor superlattice material or              photorefractive compounds.                                                                                                                                      Integration of our guided mode and radiation mode coupling results              into a single coupled-mode theory will be pursued.  This would permit           simultaneously taking into account radiation loss and guided wave               phenomenon in the analysis and design of intersecting waveguide                 devices.",
