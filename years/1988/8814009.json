 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematicians of Dartmouth College will integrate computers into               and plan the restructuring of the calculus curriculum.                                                                                                          Their approach will emphasize elementary functions and use the                  computer for graphical displays and computation of tables of                    function values.  Student written programs will be used to                      investigate these functions.  Differentiation and integration                   will be taught by means of the difference calculus, making heavy                use of the computer.  These concepts will be used to solve \"real-               world\" problems.                                                                                                                                                It is expected that students will gain a deeper understanding of                calculus concepts from the combination of theory, applications                  and computer investigations.  During the four course calculus                   sequence, students will develop the capabilities of doing their                 own numerical and graphical investigations independently.                                                                                                       Dartmouth will develop text and computer materials, demonstration               programs and problems.  Plans for the testing and evaluation of                 this new curriculum will be made during the planning grant.                                                                                                     Dartmouth is financing one-third of the project.",
