 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Carnegie-Rochester Conferences on Public Policy are designed                to foster research and discussion of major policy issues by economists          from academia and policy-making institutions.  Economists in                    universities are often unfamiliar with the constraining effect of               institutional arrangements in the shaping of policy issues and policies         and economists in government are often less aware of current research           and its implications.  A central purpose of the conference is to                provide the interaction between these groups in order to improve the            economic analysis of policy issues and policy.  The specific aims of            the conference are to develop the implications of recent research for           policy; bring together economists with different approaches or                  conclusions to narrow the differences; and to uncover the analysis used         by institutions that set policies.  The conferences are held                    semi-annually at Carnegie-Mellon University and the University of               Rochester.  About 50 participants plus faculty and graduate students            from the host institutions are invited to each conference.                      Participants from U.S. and foreign central banks and U.S. and                   international agencies attend regularly.  Special care is taken to              involve promising younger scholars.  The papers and formal discussions          are edited and prepared for publication to broaden the impact of the            conference.                                                                                                                                                     The high quality of past meetings in this conference series show                that the conference organizers have the ability to accomplish the goals         of this project.",
