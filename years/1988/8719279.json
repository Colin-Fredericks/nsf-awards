 "awd_abstract_narration": "The archaeological record pertaining to various regional                   Mississippian culture sequences (A.D. 900-1540) is a laboratory                 for developing and testing models of change and stability in                    chiefdom-level societies.  Recently, the major thrust of                        Mississippian research has been to understand the culture as an                 adaptive system and account for the dramatic organizational                     changes evident over several hundred years.  In order to do this                more effectly, tighter chronologies are needed.                                      This project has two specific objectives: to develop a                     theoretical model to explain site variability in Kent phase,                    Mississippian culture sites in the southeastern United States;                  and to develop and calibrate a regional ceramic chronology which                will permit more sophisticated measuring of population trends and               settlement pattern changes during the Mississippian period.  The                student will excavate two stratified middens, Clay Hill and the                 Kent Site, in eastern Arkansas.                                                      Determining the development of late Mississippian society is               an important question in archaeology, one addressed most                        effectively at a regional level.",
