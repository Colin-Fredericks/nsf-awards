 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project experimentally determines the nonstationary                        mechanics of  pneumatic tires.  Some work has been done in this                 area previously but  it has been based on experiments of rolling                tires loaded against a  curved surface.  This research enables                  dynamic force and moment  measurements to be made on rolling                    tires loaded against a more  realistic flat surface.  The                       pneumatic tire is the primary determinant of the dynamic behavior               of motor vehicles.  In addition, it exhibits mechanical                         properties which have a major influence on the dynamic behavior                 of castered wheels, such as the self excited oscillations of                    nose or tail wheels on aircraft or of steerable wheels on motor                 vehicles.                                                                                                                                                       These measurements can subsequently be used to improve the                      analytical tire dynamics model.  The experimental effort                        comprises fourteen steps of activity.  Six of these involve                     modification of the existing  experiment facility while the                     remaining eight are oriented to  measuring tire dynamics                        characteristics.",
