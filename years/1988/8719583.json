 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal intends to take two fairly diverse areas,                         combustion and nonlinear dynamics of shells, and apply a similar                numerical method (domain decomposition) to both areas.  Each                    area is represented by a well known researcher, Belytschko-                     shells & Bayliss-combustion, and in the application of the                      method an expert in numerical optimization, Nocedal, will                       contribute to the effort.  This proposal is a nice example of                   interdisciplinary research within a university.  Using domain                   decomposition as a connection the three researchers will                        cooperate to make advances not only in their individual areas,                  but also in parallel                                                            processing.                                                                                                                                                     The original proposal was for a three year effort.  Due to the                  uncertain program funding, and the heavy future commitment, this                proposal is recommended for only two years as a standard grant.                 As discussed with the PI's, a number of other cost reductions                   have been included: the visiting professor has not been                         approved; the disc upgrade has not been included; the networking                request has been denied; most important, the number of graduate                 students has been reduced from three to two.  It is felt that by                this last action that the three faculty members will have to                    coordinate their research in order to best occupy these two                     students.",
