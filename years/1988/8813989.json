 "awd_abstract_narration": "The lack of empirical data describing the cost of                          precision in manufacturing processes is restricting the                         development of cost driven computer-based engineering design                    tools for such tasks as: tolerance analysis, process planning,                  tool design and manufacturability evaluations.  The objective                   of this study is to evaluate the applicability of existing                      manufacturing data to the determination of empirical relations                  for the relative cost of produced tolerances.  This initial                     study will examine a limited number of machining processes.  A                  cooperative research effort with United States manufacturers                    will provide actual production data.                                                 The cost of precision is the result of many simultaneous                   factors, including: process, size, shape material, tooling,                     amount of perform, etc.  The question to be resolved is whether                 a factorial design may be implemented successfully to isolate                   the effects of each factor and determine a quantitative                         representation.  Relative cost will be determined from time                     studies and charge rates.  The resulting cost versus tolerance                  functions will be plotted for discrete sizes of parts for each                  process, with additional multiplicative factors for the effects                 of material, shape, etc.",
