This award recommendation is made under the Program for Long and                Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence.  The                     program is designed to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to                  conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                   proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the conduct                of joint research and the utilization of unique or complementary                facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in foreign                    countries.                                                                                                                                                      Awards are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant                to the applicant's field of science, the prospective potential of               the applicant for professional growth, as well as criteria                      relevant to the furthering of international cooperation in                      science and engineering.  The program is particularly directed to               scientists and engineers who are embarking on their research                    careers.                                                                                                                                                        The project is under the direction of Dr. Peter Alpert,                         Department of Botany, University of Amherst, Amherst, MA, in                    collaboration with Professor Jacques Roy, Laboratory of Plant                   Physiological Ecology, CNRS, B.P. 5051, 34033 Montpellier,                      France.                                                                                                                                                         The award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,               international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents                  allowance, if applicable, language training, if required, and a                 flat administrative allowance of $250.00 for the U.S. home                      institution.",
