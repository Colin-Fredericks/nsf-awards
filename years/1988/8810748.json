 "awd_abstract_narration": "Courts and informal procedures change as state power expands and                economic changes occur.  Understanding of these transformations                 requires examination of the historical evolution of conflict management         procedures in relation to political and economic change.  In this               project, Dr. Westermark revisits the Highlands of New Guinea where ten          years ago he had the opportunity to study the then incipient centrally          imposed court system.  His inquiry focuses on how the relationship              between that centrally imposed court structure and the indigenous legal         culture has developed.  Specifically, he investigates how local forms           of dispute processing are connected to the national legal system, from          the decisions of individual disputants to the policy decisions of legal         planners.  The data from this study are drawn primarily from case               records of local and district courts, from in-court observations, and           from systematic interviews with the parties in the dispute.  To insure          that the range of disputes likely to occur are considered in this               research, periodic interviews with a community sample will also be              conducted, addressing such issues as individuals' knowledge of,                 experience with, and problem solving strategies in handling recent              disputes.                                                                                                                                                       Using an interactionist model which pays heed to the adaptations of the         state system to indigenous legal cultures and practices, the project            has the potential to make an important contribution to understanding            how state structures affect both disputing and the effectiveness of             dispute resolution procedures.  It should illuminate the interaction of         local legal culture and state-ordered reforms in different categories           of cases and with different populations.  As importantly, by looking at         changes and development over time, this study examines the state and            the function of village courts from a more dynamic framework.",
