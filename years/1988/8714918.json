 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will bring together investigators in the                      physical, biological, and social sciences, and parts of the                     humanities to conduct interdisciplinary research on a variety                   of non-adaptive and adaptive complex systems which share common                 conceptual features, but are traditionally studied separately                   within separate disciplines.  Major tasks include discrimi-                     nating choice of initial problems and participants; control of                  disciplinary quality in interdisciplinary areas; integrative                    review to define the paradigms common to all of the seemingly                   disparate subjects chosen; a publication program to make                        results readily available to workers in a broad spectrum of                     traditional disciplines; and development of procedures                          designed to nurture research across disciplines.  In initial                    operations, the Center will place principal emphasis on                         workshops, extended research programs, and ongoing research                     networks.  Illustrative fields that may be involved are evolu-                  tionary biology, economics as an adaptive, nonlinear system,                    fluid dynamics, protein  dynamics, polymers, and public                         policy.                                                                              By facilitating applications of techniques from diverse                    disciplines that deal with complex systems to other such                        disciplines, this project could result in more rapid progress                   in some areas than would be accomplished by disciplinary                        specialists concentrating on the \"traditional\" methods of their                 fields.  While the extent to which this approach will succeed                   is certainly not clear, and the extent to which future advances                 in the disciplines addressed will be identifiable as stemming                   from this project is in doubt, the potential \"payoff\" to                        individual disciplines of even a limited number of successes is                 very large.",
