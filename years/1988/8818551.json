 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Maureen Hanson and her colleagues at Cornell University will                establish a Plant Science Center.  The Center will provide                      salaries and supplies for three technicians, for up to 12                       undergraduate summer assistantships, up to 12 advanced graduate                 students (pre-doctorate fellows), and eight postdoctorate                       fellows.  The University will fund an additional two advanced                   graduate fellows and up to 10 graduate students during their                    first two years of study.  A modest budget allowance will provide               for improvements in equipment (\"particle gun\") that delivers DNA                coated on microprojectiles to plant cell nuclei, mitochondria and               chloroplasts.  This technology was invented, and is being                       developed cooperatively, by Cornell biologists in the College of                Agriculture and Life Sciences and engineers at Cornell's National               Nanofabrication Facility (now in its 11th year of NSF funding).                                                                                                 Co-investigators and their postdocs will be moving into the new                 Biotechnology Building this summer.  The facility, built at a                   cost of $32 million shared by Cornell and the State of New York,                will have a large central plant Cell Culture and Transformation                 Facility (CCTF).  It will operate chiefly for the Center's                      investigators and their students but it will be available for                   other Cornell faculty, for visiting scientists, for scientists of               the independent but campus-housed Boyce Thompson Institute for                  Plant Research, and for industrial scientists.                                                                                                                  In addition to the training program and the CCTF, a third                       component of the Center is the technology development project.                  It seeks new means for isolating important plant genes, for the                 experimental analysis of plant gene function and for transferring               genetic information into nuclear and organelle genomes.  Central                to the latter is biolistics--a term used to denote directed                     delivery of extracellular DNA or genes, coated on                               microprojectiles, into discrete structures of intact plant cells.               Further development of this new but proven technology is crucial                to highly predictable and efficient transformation of model plant               systems and agronomically important species.                                                                                                                    Cornell has long been a notable preparer of students and postdocs               for academic and industrial careers in plant science.  The Center               would unite diverse faculty research in a core theme with a well-               conceived multiphasic student training program, and would house                 them in a state of the art facility dedicated entirely to the                   faculty in the Sections of Genetics and Development, and                        Biochemistry, Molecular and Cellular Biology.  In addition to the               on-campus co-investigators, strong collaborative relationships                  exist with the University's Agricultural Experiment Station at                  Geneva, The Boyce Thompson Institute and the USDA's Plant Gene                  Expression Laboratory at Albany, California.                                                                                                                    The Center's management and administration will be considerably                 aided by affiliation with Cornell's five-year old Biotechnology                 Program which will provide services on-campus as well as                        visibility and outreach to the State and industrial members.  The               Program is a consortium of Cornell, the State of New York and                   several large firms.  A fourth element is support derived from                  the U.S. Army which has named Cornell a Biotechnology Center of                 Excellence.  Presently, in none of these components is there a                  major emphasis on plant science which will be provided by the                   Center.",
