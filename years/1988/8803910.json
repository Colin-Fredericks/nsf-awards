 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mass-age data on global sedimentary carbonates require that                global limestone and dolostone comprise about 3,500 x 10^20 g of                carbonate Ca with a cycling rate of 0.25% per million years.                    Epoch-interval  deviations are small, suggesting relatively                     constant long-term rates of deposition and destruction.  Best-fit               curves through data on deep oceanic and shallow cratonic                        reservoirs indicate that shallow water limestone formation has                  been decreasing at a rate of about 0.7% per million years.                      Holocene shallow water limestone accumulation is not 60% lower                  than during the Mesozoic.                                                            Possible reasons for global carbonate transfer from shallow                to deep setting are largely unconstrained.  Biologically-medicated              processes related to the Mesozoic diversification of planktic                   protozoans may have resulted in the progressive replacement of                  shallow shelly faunas by deep oceanic calcifiers as the principle               sink for a finite marine carbonate flux.  Conversely, decline of                cratonic carbonate reservoir mass may reflect physicochemically-                mediated processes related to global sea level and the extent of                carbonate-saturated seas.  Preliminary data indicate that ongoing               carbonate transfer is also recorded by correlation between                      Cenozoic positions of the continents, global sea level, and the                 latitudinal extent of cratonic limestones.                                           The project will:  1) compile global data on the areal                     extent, latitudinal setting, and vertical accumulation rates of                 shoal-water carbonate platforms; and 2) document relations between              present patterns of shallow water carbonate accumulation and                    ambient fluid carbonate chemistry.  Collectively, this effort will              allow for the evaluation of relations between eustasy, ambient                  fluid saturation state, biological versus chemical precipitation                processes, and global patterns of carbonate accumulation, and will              directly constrain the history of surface carbonate saturation in               shallow marine settings.  This global data base will be of major                importance to interpreting paleoclimate and understanding                       evolution of the ocean.",
