 "awd_abstract_narration": "A regional conference for mathematicians and engineers involved in              undergraduate education was held on September 30 and October 1, 1988,           in Memphis, Tennessee.  The conference was jointly hosted by Memphis            State University, Mississippi State University, and Tennessee State             University.  More than 200 representatives of colleges and universities         in the Southeastern Region consisting roughly of East Texas, Arkansas,          Tennessee, Louisiana, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, Southern         Illinois, and Missouri.  The conference goals were three-fold:  (1) to          provide a series of presentations on the ways in which undergraduate            mathematics programs are being changed to take advantage of computer            symbolic manipulations capabilities, (2) to explore the needs and               strategies for engineering education especially at the Historically             Black Colleges and Universities in the region, (3) to provide an                overview of National Science Foundation support for curriculum                  development in science, engineering, and mathematics at the                     undergraduate level.  From the conference presentations, a paper on the         use of computer algebras will be prepared and submitted for publication         in the NOTICES of the American Mathematical Society and in FOCUS, the           newsletter of the Mathematical Society of America. A second paper on            the role of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities in                 engineering education will be submitted for publication in the                  newsletter of the American Society of Engineering Education.",
