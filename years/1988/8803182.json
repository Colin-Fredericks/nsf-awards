 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation award will support an                           investigation of rural energy systems in Morocco.  Energy is of                 major importance for the improvement of household living                        standards, increased agricultural production and storage, the                   development of local industries, and the access of rural                        communities to area and national markets.  The research will                    focus on the interdependencies between energy use and village                   social organization in a cluster of 12 representative villages.                 The purpose of the project is to develop a comprehensive                        understanding of the role of energy in the economy of the study                 villages.  Based on an in-depth survey of the food-fuel-fodder-                 fertilizer cycle, a detailed picture will be developed of                       energy use in the study region.  Information related to energy                  usage patterns, distribution networks, and availability                         constraints will be acquired through a variety of survey                        research techniques.  Environmental input-output analyses will                  be used to determine energy balances, flow diagrams, and the                    potential for interfuel substitution.  The project will enhance                 our understanding of energy as a pivotal production frontier                    for economic and social development and will offer a model                      framework for assessing future energy requirements and                          technological interventions in the region.  It will provide                     knowledge essential to our understanding of the global economy.",
