 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to study the molecular and               structural aspects of phase separation in ionomers (ionic                       polymers) by continuous wave (cw) and pulsed Electron Spin                      Resonance (ESR) methods.  This approach is well suited for                      studying the complex heterogeneous structure of ionomers, because               it is non-invasive and allows selective study of the portion of                 the sample where the paramagnetic probe is located.  In the                     hydrophilic phase, attempts will be made to define the local                    environment of the cations, the intercation distance and the size               of ionic aggregates.  The mobility and degree of crystallinity of               the polymer chains in the hydrophobic phase will be studied using               peroxy radical probes.  The interface, and the penetration of the               polar regions into the organic network, will be studied by                      following the partition and dynamics of nitroxide probes whose                  hyperfine splittings are sensitive to the polarity of the medium.               Weak interactions of the paramagnetic centers with neighboring                  protons and deuterons, which cannot be detected by cw ESR, will                 be studied by Electron Spin Echo (ESE) spectroscopy.  DSC studies               will be used to detect heterogeneity in the phase structure and                 to deduce the relative amounts of bound and mobile water in the                 system. Perfluorinated ionomers containing sulfonic and                         carboxylic groups and polyurethane ionomers containing carboxylic               groups will be investigated.  These studies are important for an                understanding of ionic transport and selectivity in synthetic and               biological membranes, of photo-induced charge separation                        processes in ionomers, and also for polymer blends in which phase               separation is prevented by crosslinking ionic groups.",
