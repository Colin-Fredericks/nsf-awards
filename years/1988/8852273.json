 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer technology is playing an increasingly important role in           the biological sciences.  Computers are being used for data acquisition         and analysis, and they make the simulation of complex biological                systems possible.  Despite their importance, the integration of                 computers into the undergraduate biology curriculum has not been                consistently achieved.  This means that students often underestimate            the need for quantitative skills in modern biological research.                                                                                                      This project attempts to overcome this problem by developing a             computer laboratory for the biological sciences.  The laboratory is             being configured with a network of 12 MacIntosh II computers to allow           for interaction among the instructor and students.  One of the main             uses of the lab is to allow students to develop their analytical skills         by designing simulation models of biological processes.  Simulations            are used in the department's Ecology, Limnology, Human Physiology and           Research courses.  The new equipment also supports the development of           an Evolution course in which the majority of the labs are to be based           on model building.  In addition, the lab is used by students in a               number of classes to acquire data from scientific instruments and to            conduct the subsequent statistical analyses of these data.  Finally             there are plans to use the computer lab for literature searching and            accessing external databases through the college's local area network.                                                                                               The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
