 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Abir-Am is continuing her exploration and comparison of the                 processes and products of interaction among members of four                     research schools in molecular biology in the US, UK, and France                 between 1935 and 1970.  The project traces the evolution of each                research school as a distinct social and intellectual unit from                 earlier origins in diverse combinations of disciplines.  The                    project further traces the confluence of these once isolated                    schools into the new discipline of molecular biology as distinct                from both classical biology and biochemistry.  The project seeks                to compare the research programs of the four research schools,                  their categories of social membership, their institutional                      ecology and their opportunities in science policy, both national                and international.                                                                                                                                              Dr. Abir-Am combines both historical and sociological methods to                explore the interaction among members of a school as well as                    inter-school contacts.  Thus, archival research on the personal                 and institutional papers of the founders/leaders of each school                 are supplemented by oral history interviews with members and                    affiliates.                                                                                                                                                     This project will help to clarify the actual operations of                      research schools as informal arenas for transactions in                         \"currencies\" such as creativity, experimental dexterity,                        credibility, and loyalty.  It will also evaluate how schools                    relate to scientific progress, change and stratification and                    explain how scientific authority is delegated and legitimized                   within research schools, by schools within the wider disciplinary               domain, and why schools both enable and constrain innovations and               careers.",
