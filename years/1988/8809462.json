 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to investigate the life cycle                 and mechanism of action of opioid receptors in cultured                         neuroblastoma hybrid cells.  The questions that will be addressed               include:  1) What are the sites of receptor synthesis and                       processing within the cell? 2) How are they transported to the                  cell surface (which is the locus for most of the binding sites                  and their major site of action in signal transduction)? 3) How                  are they transported back into the cell? 4) Are they internalized               for functional reasons as well as for degradation?  The rodent                  neuroblastoma cells to be studied have been demonstrated to                     contain large amounts of a single class of opioid receptor.  They               are far simpler than brain in the types of receptor present, and                they are more manipulatable.  Opioid receptors from the cell                    surface will be separated from those found in various organelles                within the cells by subcellular fractionation techniques.                       Changes in receptor concentration, ligand binding properties, and               molecular weight will be assessed in the different cellular                     compartments as a function of time after treatment of the cells                 with agents that either inhibit the processing of the receptor or               enhance their synthesis.  Once suitably large populations of                    intracellular receptors are identified as being either newly                    synthesized enroute to the cell surface or sites being                          internalized, their properties will be compared.  Kinetic and                   steady state binding studies will be performed on the receptor                  populations to provide information on their mechanism of signal                 transduction.  Knowledge of receptor synthesis, action and                      turnover will contribute to the ultimate elucidation of the                     molecular mechanisms of drug dependence and tolerance.  Since                   morphine, heroin and other related drugs of abuse act at opioid                 receptors of the central and peripheral nervous system, such                    knowledge will have an impact on rational approaches to the                     treatment of drug dependence.",
