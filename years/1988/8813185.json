All disciplines of the                 field are applied to answer fundamental questions about the                     world's marine environment.                                                          Bigelow Laboratory is respected for its high quality                       research atmosphere, but much of the equipment is not state-of-                 the-art.  This project concerns areas of research in which                      Bigelow has demonstrated leadership: phytoplankton productivity;                the biology of the smallest photosynthetic marine organisms both                eukaryotic and prokaryotic, including their identification by                   various techniques including analysis of pigments and of immune                 reactions, their enumeration and distribution in nature, their                  structure, and contribution to marine production and the global                 sulfur cycle; the oceanography of the Gulf of Maine; the biology                of local fish populations and certain invertebrates.  The project               will provide microscopic equipment (brightfield, phase contrast,                epi-illumination, epifluorescence, and stereoscopic), and algal                 culture boxes for experimental purposes. These items will                       increase the utilization of the Center for Culture of Marine                    Phytoplankton and the Flow Cytometry and Cell Separation                        facilities housed at the Bigelow Laboratory.",
