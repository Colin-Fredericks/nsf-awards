 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concentrates on algorithmic aspects of problems               in combinatorics, emphasizing the interplay between combinatorics               and qualitative matrix theory.  Qualitative matrix problems arise               in situations where data is imprecise, for example, where                       knowledge is limited to qualitative information.  One problem is                to derive more qualitative information from qualitative data,                   such as determining the sign pattern of the solution to a linear                system of equations from that of its coefficients.  Graph                       theoretic problems relating to such signsolvability will be                     studied.                                                                             In many real life situations, the data available is not in                 the form of numbers, but rather the information may be only that                each number of interest is positive or negative.  Mathematical                  methods to extract further information from such data are being                 developed, and have bearing on such areas as ecology, chemistry,                mechanics, and energy planning.",
