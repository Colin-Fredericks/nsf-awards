 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project investigates a protein complex that is                    found only in retinal photoreceptors.  The complex is composed of               a phosphoprotein of 33,000 (33K) daltons and two proteins (beta                 and gamma transducin) which have been shown to participate in the               visual transduction process.  Association of beta-gamma                         transducin with the 33K protein and the ability of light to                     trigger the dephosphorylation of 33K suggests that the 33K/T                    beta-gamma complex may act to modulate the phototransduction                    process, particularly in mammalian photoreceptors.  The PI will                 focus on the light-modulated phosphorylation/dephosphorylation                  cycle of the 33K protein.  Phosphorylation of the 33K protein may               modify interactions between the 33K protein and the beta-gamma                  subunits of transducin or it could alter the functional                         activities of the 33K/T beta-gamma complex.  These studies are                  significant in a broader sense because transducin belongs to a                  family of homologous GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins) that are                 involved in signal transduction in a variety of tissues.  In each               tissue, a receptor for an extracellular signal, e.g., light,                    hormone or neurotransmitter, is coupled to a G-protein which                    regulates cellular function.  It is still unclear how G-proteins                are down-regulated, but proteins which may be analogous to the                  33K/T-beta-gamma complex seem to be involved.  Understanding the                mechanisms which regulate the visual process is a major goal of                 this project, and each increment of accomplishment provides                     insight into how phosphoproteins interact with the family of G-                 proteins and, thereby, influence the many cellular functions                    which G-proteins mediate.",
