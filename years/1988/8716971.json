 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kreidl will observe A-type (Ap) stars to search for stars with                  rapid oscillations (periods of a few minutes).  An accurate                     measure of the period is possible, permitting very detailed checks              on theoretical models.  Kreidl will also measure stellar                        variability on time scales of hours, to determine the nature of                 sporadic variations and to relate any regular variations to other               (delta Scuti) variable stars with similar colors and luminosities.                                                                                              Many stars pulsate, growing and shrinking regularly.  The                       pulsations have taught us much about the interior of those stars.               A new kind of stellar oscillations has now been observed,                       involving horizontal as well as radial motions.  Observed solar                 oscillations already provide qualitatively new information on the               solar interior.  Kreidl will investigate one group of oscillating               stars, performing the first search in the northern hemisphere and               measuring oscillation periods more accurately than is possible on               the Sun.  The telescopes of the Lowell Observatory allow the                    extended observing times needed to measure oscillations and other               forms of stellar variability.",
