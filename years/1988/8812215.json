 "awd_abstract_narration": "The issue of child support has become increasingly prominent on the             policy and research agenda, as growing numbers of children are raised           by single parent mothers.  Underresearched areas have been the nature           and distribution of child support as well as the outcomes, for the              mothers involved, of various levels of child support awards.  This              study will provide a broad picture of the child support process,                including the identification of subgroups in particular need of child           support assistance.  This work is important in that it locates child            support within a larger context, including related decisions made               during the divorce process, other monetary transfers between fathers            and mothers, and the legal environment.                                                                                                                         The proposed research will use secondary data to examine the impact of          a number of factors on child support outcomes, including the economic           needs of the mothers and children, the resources available to them, the         ability and motivation of the fathers, and the nature of the legal              environment.  Previous studies have focused almost exclusively on the           characteristics of the mothers.  The impact of child support on                 subsequent life-course transitions will also be ascertained, including          remarriage, schooling and labor force participation.  The data will be          drawn from follow-up surveys of the National Longitudinal Study of the          High School Class of 1972.                                                                                                                                      It has been estimated that 50 percent of children born recently will            experience life in a single-parent family.  The increase in female-             headed families is of particular concern, given that such families              often lack the financial resources to be self-sufficient.  Child                support payments have been touted as the solution to the financial              plight of single-parent families.  This study will illuminate the               nature, distribution and consequences of such support.",
