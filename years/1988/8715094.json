 "awd_abstract_narration": "Currently, there is no simple, unambiguous, nontraumatic                   method of establishing the sex of monomorphic birds, those whose                sex is not apparent from external appearence.  Surgical                         identification, the method most frequently used, requires a                     skilled veterinarian and is not applicable until the bird reaches               sexual maturity.  Even with mature birds, identification of the                 sex organs can be difficult, ambiguous or impossible.  Because of               the dangers from anesthesia and surgery, most managers of captive               breeding programs choose karyotyping to identify the sexes.  This               method, though less dangerous than surgical sexing, requires                    about a milliliter of blood and is such a specialized procedure                 that only a handful of people/labs have been able to do it                      successfully.                                                                        The goal of this project is to develop a DNA probe which can               be used in a standard DNA hybridization technique, to sex a bird                using DNA from a drop of blood or from cells from the pulp of a                 feather.  Such sex-specific DNA sequences have been found in a                  variety of species.                                                                  The investigators have created a genomic library                           representing approximately 6000 random DNA fragments and are in                 the process of identifying those DNA clones which hybridize to                  female but not male DNA.  If successful in isolating a probe from               whooping cranes, the investigators will attempt to develop sex-                 specific probes for members of other endangered species.                        Although the project is primarily concerned with sexing birds,                  the results are also expected to shed light upon molecular                      evolution of sex-specific DNA and, in the long tern the phylogeny               of birds.",
