 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intensification of agricultural production is a common outcome                  of development in third world countries.  There is a commonly                   held notion that agricultural intensification in traditional                    societies leads to a decrease in the types and varieties of                     plants grown and a concomitant loss of knowledge about those                    previously grown.  However, almost no research has been                         conducted to determine under which set of circumstances this                    assumption is valid.                                                                                                                                            During this project, the researcher will test the assumption                    that intensification leads to simplification and loss of                        knowledge by peasant farmers.  He will study peasant maize                      farmers in Chiapas, Mexico to see if modern intensive                           agricultural methods are used to maintain diversity in resource                 poor areas in the highlands and lowlands.  Special attention                    will be given to identifying crucial variables in the decision                  making process of individual farmers.                                                                                                                           This project will contribute to our understanding of the way                    resource poor farmers adapt their agricultural production to                    their environment as they intensify.  In addition, the data                     from this project will help policy makers understand the                        potential and limitations of efforts aimed at increasing                        agricultural productivity in Mexico.",
