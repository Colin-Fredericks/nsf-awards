 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grammatical relations such as subject and object are central               concepts in the description of human languages, because they are                crucial inthe encoding of form-meaning correspondences.  Such                   relations, particularly subject, are difficult to define                        formally, since all languages permit some divergence of external                features and grammatical/semantic role, such as passive clauses.                Subjects in Hindi-Urdu are an extreme case of such divergence, as               both agent and dative-experiencer phrases may have the external                 coding of non-subjects, but retain syntactic and semantic                       features of subjects.  Sentence data from Hindi-Urdu will be used               to explore the syntax of the language, particular with reference                to dative experiencers, and to find an explanation for the mixed                behavior of subject-like phrases.  This will be based on the                    hypothesis that the level of Logical Form is where syntactic                    restrictions are stated.  As the statement of form/function                     correspondence is an issue on which current syntactic theories                  differ, the analysis of dativesubject phrases in this language                  has interesting implications for syntactic theory and language                  universals.                                                                          Dr. Davison will teach two courses in the Department of                    Modern Languages and Linguistics and collaborate in research on                 grammatical relations and linguistic theory.  She will also                     organize a colloquium on factors adversely affecting the careers                of women in linguistics.  A report of the result of this meeting                will be circulated.                                                                  This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1)                 to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                  engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF                  and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and                     engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists                and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic                    institutions.  By encouraging the participation of women in                     science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future                     scientific vitality.",
