 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Palmer Archepelago extends extends from Tower Island (63o33'S               59o51'W) in the north to the Joubin Islands (64o47'S 64o27'W) in the            south, and experiences a more maritime climate than the Antarctic               continent.  The productivity of the surrounding waters supports colonies        of a large number of charadriiform bird species (sheathbills, gulls,            skuas, and terns), many of which do not migrate.  Due to the remoteness         of the location, very little is known about birds living in this region.        Parmelee has been surveying bird populations of the Palmer Archepelago          since the early 1970's, and has compiled extensive information on age           structure, breeding fidelity, and longevity for a variety of species            during studies on the behavior and ecology of birds adapted to this             unique polar environment.  Under this award Parmelee will synthesize            information previously collected and compile it in a monograph which            will cover the entire Palmer archipelago.  The monograph will combine           many small projects, highlight significant findings, preserve base-line         information for areas previously unexplored, and present results from           unpublished field notes on numbers, habitats and colony locations for           all charadriiform bird species.  The monograph on bird species of the           Palmer Archepelago will be a useful reference volume for ornithologists         and for agencies concerned with Antarctic living resources.",
