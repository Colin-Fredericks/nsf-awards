 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Kidd will continue his work to collect, preserve, and analyze               DNA from a large series of anthropologically significant                        populations.  Through collaboration with field anthropologists                  who will provide blood samples, Dr. Kidd will preserve material                 as Epstein-Barr virus transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines. The                DNA of these samples will then be studied for several DNA                       polymorphisms (RFLPS).                                                                                                                                          One goal of this work is to construct a data bank from as large a               number of populations as possible.  Because the number of highly                polymorphic RFLPs is much greater than the number of classical                  genetic markers, they provide a much improved tool for                          determining the affinities between different populations.                       Secondly, Dr. Kidd will pursue three related goals:  1.                         estimation of genetic distance between all populations in order                 to infer the phylogenetic relationships among the groups, 2.                    investigation of the amount and nature of variability within and                between groups for the purpose of inferring population                          demographic history, and 3. investigation of the possibility of                 observing the operation of natural selection in human                           populations.                                                                                                                                                    Prehistorians and historians are interested in tracing the                      movements of human populations.  Unfortunately, written records                 appear only late in the human record, and archaeological evidence               is often ambiguous.  Many provocative hypotheses have been                      proposed about the relationships of different groups but with                   traditional data these are difficult to prove or disprove.                      Through analysis of DNA RFLPS, Dr. Kidd's research should help to               provide answers.",
