 "awd_abstract_narration": "The movement of plant carbon from roots into the soil and                  the effects of this carbon on nitrogen mineralization and                       immobilization processes in the soil will be studied.                           Experiments will be performed using radioactive and stable                      isotope tracers to follow the movement and transformations of                   14CO2 and 5NH4 in root chambers (rhizotrons) planted with                       Pinus ponderosa and Bromus mollis.                                                   The mass and activity of microorganisms will be a central                  focus of the research.  The spatial distribution of microbial                   biomass will be determined in relation to plant roots.  The                     metabolic state of these microorganisms will be assessed using                  vital stains and microautoradiography.  Nitrogen mineralization                 and immobilization will be determined using short-term 15N pool                 dilution experiments.  Results from these studies will be used to               compare the metabolic status of rhizosphere and bulk soil                       microorganisms and to determine the importance of microbial                     competition for plant nutrients at the soil-root interface for                  these model systems.                                                                 The significance of this project is that it should yield a                 valuable data base for future work on the relationship between                  plant carbon from roots and the amount of N available to plants;                that is, it will lead to insight as to what controls N                          availability in soil systems.  This is an important issue since N               is often the nutrient limiting plant growth in ecosystems world-                wide.                                                                                The facilities at the University of California, Berkeley,                  are excellent for this type of research.  Dr. Firestone is a                    first-rate scientist and teacher and this area of research is one               of her specialties.  Ms. Norton shows all evidence of being a                   promising student with three publications to her credit even                    before beginning her doctoral work.",
