 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to analytically and experimentally            investigate the formation of macro-shrinkage/porosity and                       micro-porosity in alloy solidification.  This is achieved by dividing           the research into two steps.  In the first step, a numerical                    technique, based on the finite element method, will be developed for            the solution of the conduction heat transfer with phase change.  The            finite element analysis program which is implemented in this step will          be interfaced with the existing geometrical modeling programs to form           a CAD/CAM package.  The second step is to extend the model to                   calculations of interdentritic fluid flow in the mushy region during            alloy solidification.  Both the first model and the second model will           be validated by comparing their solutions with experimental                     measurements as well as with available data in the literature.                                                                                                  The metal castings foundry is one of the Nation's oldest industries,            but the fundamental understanding of the processes is lacking.  The             proposed research is expected to make significant contributions not             only to the understanding of the formation of macro-shrinkage and               micro-porosity of the castings, but also to the design for casting              processes for producing sound castings at a lower cost.",
