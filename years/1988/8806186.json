 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bivalve molluscs (clams) have perhaps the best fossil record               of any invertebrate group, and the sallops are particularly                     well-represented as fossils.  Drs. Norman Newell and Donald Boyd                propose to continue their career-long collaborative research                    into the evolutionary history of the scallops.  This project                    would complete their efforts to document the genera and species                 of scallops that occur in the interval of time bracketing the                   worldwide mass extinction at the end of the Permian Period.                     Scallops are unusually well-represented in rocks of late Permian                and early Triassic age, and they therefore represent an                         excellent opportunity to study the pattern of this extinction                   event.                                                                               The proposed research will greatly increase our                            understanding of an important episode in the history of the                     Earth.  The careful and consistent taxonomic framework                          constructed by investigators such as Newell and Boyd provide the                best insights into the processes contributing to mass                           extinctions.  The planned research will have important                          implications for stratigraphy, paleogeography, and evolutionary                 biology.",
