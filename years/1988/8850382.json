 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a growing interest in the country for reform in the area of            elementary science education.  While most science educators recognize           the need for hands-on science education, those currently engaged in             reform efforts recognize that one of the crucial failings of the                previous curriculum work in this area was the inability or unwillingness        of developers to devise new forms of student assessment to meet the             needs of material based science programs.  This proposal is for an              invitational conference to address the need for curriculum independent          tests and assessment tools for classroom teachers to use in conjunction         with instruction.  New ideas about elementary science assessment can            come from other curriculum areas (reading and writing), recently                developed indicators of science achievement such as the National                Assessment of Educational Progress assessment, new NSF-supported                curriculum developments, and research on children's conceptions of              science.  The conference, based on a series of commissioned papers, will        address how these developments can form the basis for new instruments           and methods.  The result will be a monograph for wide dissemination and         suggestions for future developmental work in elementary science                 assessment.",
