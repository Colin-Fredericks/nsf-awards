 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bovine papillomavirus (BPV) DNA can be stably maintained in                     infected cells as an extrachromosomal replicon.  Stable copy                    number maintenance of the BPV genome requires coordinate                        regulation of viral and cellular DNA replication.  Genetic                      analysis has identified two viral activities essential for                      regulated viral DNA replication, but the gene products                          themselves have not been identified yet.  Both of the                           genetically defined activities map at least in part to the E1                   open reading frame (ORF).  The proposed project will identify                   and characterize the E1 gene products.  Identification will                     be immunological detection using a set of regionally directed                   E1 antisera.  Anti-E1 sera will be obtained by using either                     OmpF/E1/B-galactosidase fusion proteins expressed in E. coli.                   or synthetic peptides predicted from the E1 ORF sequence, as                    immunogen.  In conjunction with the production of anti-E1                       sera, a series of E1 nonsense and in-frame deletion mutations                   will be constructed by in vitro mutagenesis.  The anti-E1                       sera and the E1 mutants will be used to determine physical                      (cellular localization, oligomeric state, post-transnational                    modification, protein-protein interaction, kinetics) and                        biochemical (ATPase, DNA binding) properties of the E1                          proteins.                                                                                                                                                       This is a proposal to study an unusual mechanism of                             maintenance of a viral infection.  The DNA of the virus under                   study is transmitted to successive generations of cells as a                    small independent chromosome, of which a small number of                        copies is stably maintained.  The virus contains genes which                    are essential for this stable transmission.  If one of these                    genes is inactivated, the viral DNA can't be reproduced at                      all.  If another of these gene's is inactivated the viral DNA                   replicates in an uncontrolled fashion, killing the lost cell.                   The products of these genes clearly allow the virus to                          coordinate its replication with that of the lost cell's DNA.                    The work proposed here is an investigation of the detailed                      biochemical mechanism of action of the products of these                        genes.  This work should yield important information on how                     some types of viral infection persist for long periods of                       time, and may also results in insights into how the lost                        cells own chromosomes are transmitted in an orderly fashion                     from one generation to the next.",
