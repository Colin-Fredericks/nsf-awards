 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Prof.                    Hugo Rossi of the University of Utah and Prof. Allessandro                      Silva and Prof. Maria Welleda Baldoni-Silva, both of the                        Universita Degli Studi Di Trento, in Italy.  The                                investigators intend to pursue work related to the                              representation theory of Lie groups, a topic of considerable                    importance in modern day mathematics and in theoretical                         physics.  More specifically, previous work of Prof. Rossi and                   others led to concrete representations of certain semi-simple                   Lie groups using generalizations of holomorphic discrete                        series as singular representations.  The collaborators intend                   to extend these investigations to a much larger class of                        representations involving discrete non-holomorphic series.                                                                                                      The Italian researchers bring to the collaboration expertise                    in analysis and geometry.  On the U.S. side, Prof. Rossi has                    been a leader in the discovery and investigation of the                         representation theory of Lie groups.  The subject is one that                   relates to many branches of mathematics and physics, for                        example differential equations and elementary particle                          physics.  The investigators' approach should prove useful in                    increasing our understanding of the connection between                          complex and harmonic analysis, the geometry of complex                          manifolds, and the representation theory of Lie groups.",
