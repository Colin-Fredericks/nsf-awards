 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study seeks to document lifelong survival patterns for                moose in Isle Royale National Park, Michigan, and to assess                     resulting impacts on adjacent trophic levels.  The study is based               on the hypothesis that nutritional plane of moose in winter                     largely determines lifelong survivorship for moose, which then                  determines wolf food level and ultimately wolf density.  The                    level of radiocarbon (14C) in moose bones and teeth collected at                Isle Royale since 1958 will be used to determine year of birth,                 based on a sharp historical peak in 14C which resulted from                     atmospheric nuclear weapons tests in the 1950s and early 1960s.                 Using the 14C dating technique, data from almost 1,400 Isle                     Royale moose alive during the past 3 decades will be used to                    track changes in cohort survival pattern and population age                     structure.  When combined with existing data on moose                           vulnerability, the results are predicted to explain long-term                   fluctuations in wolf density.                                                        Moose population simulations and actual wolf population                    responses in 1988-1990 will test the hypothesis that lifelong                   survival in moose is a key link between 3 trophic levels (wolf,                 moose, and vegetation) in this simple community.  There have been               no comparable analyses of multi-level trophic interactions                      involving large mammals, so results will be useful in both theory               and application. This study will also prompt more widespread use                of radiocarbon dating techniques in animal population studies and               other natural sciences.",
