 "awd_abstract_narration": "They plan on conducting a series of experiments that use Raman                  scattering to provide microscopic information concerning defects                in III-V semiconductors.  Several of the experiments involve                    using resonant Raman scattering (RRS).  This has two main                       benefits: 1) There will be an enhancement of the Raman signal                   strength thus increasing the sensitivity of the technique to                    lower defect concentrations and 2) RRS allows a connection to be                made between specific electronic levels associated with defects                 and the observed local vibrational modes.  This work is important               because it will look at problems that are currently of great                    importance from both a fundamental and an applications point of                 view (e.g. investigation of the resonant donor state associated                 with the DX center in gallium arsenide and aluminum gallium                     arsenide.)  The proposed work will also help develop and extend                 the technique of RRS for studying defects in semiconductors.                    They also plan to use Raman scattering to study the influence of                point defect on the interdiffusion of gallium and aluminum across               the gallium arsenide/aluminum gallium arsenide interface.  This                 is work that is important both because of the light it promises                 to shed on the physics of the interdiffusion process in general                 and because interdiffusion at this interface is of great                        practical importance for making quantum well devices in which the               carriers are confined in more than one dimension.",
