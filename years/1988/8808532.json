The goal of this research is to investigate ways to use          knowledge about process characteristics in the design of migration              algorithms.  An empirical study of existing distributed computations            will be performed to determine what kinds of process traits are                 important for migration decisions, the difficulty and cost of                   ascertaining these traits, and the relation between static predictions          of process behavior and the actual dynamic characteristics exhibited at         execution time are being design. Migration algorithms that use                  knowledge about these process traits (1) to decide which process to             migrate and (2) to ok migration based on both static and dynamic                interprocess communication patterns.  Both graph based/network flow             type algorithms as well as decentralized negotiation type algorithms            will be used.  These algorithms will be tested through simulation on a          variety of distributed computations and under varying system loads.             This work will help distributed systems reach the full power of compute         sharing by enriching our understanding of distributed computation and           through the insights into policies and mechanisms needed to guide and           provide process migration.",
