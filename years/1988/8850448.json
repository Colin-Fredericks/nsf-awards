 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Teachers Association is working with Woods                 Oceanographic Institute, selected museums, and the National Council of          Social Studies (NCSS) to develop instructional materials to prepare             teachers and students for the satellite downlinking of Robert Ballard's         JASON Mediterranean Expedition.  Students (grades 4-12) will visit the          museums  during two weeks in April 1989 and in each spring through the          year 1993 to take part in the exploration of sunken trading vessels in          the Mediterranean via the \"seeing eye\" robot, JASON.  Students will             share the first views of ancient relics with the Woods Hole scientists          assigned to the expedition and will be able to interact with these              scientists during the simultaneous live video broadcast.                                                                                                        NSTA, Woods Hole, and NCSS have identified curriculum developers,               teachers, supervisors, and museum coordinators who will design teaching         units targeted to three levels, grades 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12.  The units,         containing a teachers' guide, lesson plan, and poster, will focus on the        science and social studies relevant to the broad topics of underwater           studies, seafaring, and trade.  The materials development group will            also serve as teacher trainers to the teachers who will bring their             students (an estimated 24,000 in 1989) to the museums to take part in           the Mediterranean Expedition.  Materials will be revised each year, and         a newsletter update sent to all participating teachers.                                                                                                         This project combines scientific and professional organizations in a            concerted and unique effort to help students and teachers realize the           excitement potential in scientific research.  The instructional                 materials which are to be developed and the filming will allow future           students and teachers to benefit from the JASON undertaking, and help           them appreciate the multidisciplinary nature of oceanographic research          and the technology which makes the expeditions possible.",
