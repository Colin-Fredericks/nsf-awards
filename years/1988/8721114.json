 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will (1) reconstruct regional patterns of late                Pleistocene coastal processes and coastal chronology in the eastern             Great Basin, (2) survey 300 to 400 vertical control points on selected          shorelines having relatively well constrained ages, (3) use those               surveryed shorelines as long-baseline tiltmeters to reconstruct                 regional and local isostatic and seismotectonic deformation; (4) and            model those data to constrain the mechanical/rheological properties of          the earth.  Recent studies of coastal chronology and shoreline                  morphometry in the basins of Lake Bonneville and two nearby paleolakes          indicate that deformation of late Pleistocene shorelines resulted               mainly from loads imposed by Lake Bonneville, but probably included             far-field responses to loads imposed by continental ice sheets.  This           study will vastly expand the existing data set, to include the                  deformation of transgressive, maximum-stage, and regressive shorelines          of the last deep-lake cycle in 16 paleolake basins in the eastern Great         Basin.  Studies of coastal chronology and coastal geomorphology will be         combined with vertical control surveying using an electronic distance           measuring theodolite to define the spatial and temporal dimensions of           post-lacustrine deformation.  At the Lunar and Planetary Institute, the         observed deflections (shoreline tilt) will be modelled as the response          of a layered elastic/visco-elastic earth to loads imposed by the small          lakes, the much larger Lake Bonneville, and the still more massive but          more distant Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets.",
