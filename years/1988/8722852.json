 "awd_abstract_narration": "Boundaries (ecotones) are transition zones between ecological                   systems. (communities, ecosystems, biomes), having a set of                     characteristics uniquely defined by space and time scales and by                the strength of the interactions between adjacent ecological                    systems.  Recently there has been increasing recognition of the                 importance of patch boundaries.  This importance is based on                    several suppositions: the potential significance of boundaries                  for prudently managing the biosphere; the number of putative                    characteristics of boundaries that are significant in                           understanding ecological systems in general; and the recognized                 relative paucity of data from boundaries.  This award funds                     United States participation at an international symposium on the                \"Role of Ecotones in Aquatic Landscape Management and                           Restoration.\"  The workshop will be held in Sopron, Hungary,                    23-27 May 1988.  The funds will be used for travel of U.S.                      scientists actively participating in the workshop as plenary                    speakers or discussion group leaders, for defraying some local                  (U.S.) costs for planning, and for partial salary support for the               principal investigator while editing the workshop proceedings to                be published by Cambridge University Press.",
