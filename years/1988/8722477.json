 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation award will support research in                  industrial geography on the producer service sector and on the                  relationship between this sector and the growth of regional and                 national economies.  The project examines the relationship between the          behavior and business performance of U.S. affiliates operating in               the producer service industry of Singapore and the growth and                   development of the Singapore economy.  It will also examine the                 intraregional division of labor in the producer service industry among          the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the             relationship of this division to the produce goods sector in Singapore.                                                                                              A small but increasing body of literature has examined the role of         producer services in urban and regional settings.  This research                will determine whether producer services in well developed market               economies function with a signficant basic component, how linkage               patterns differ between indigenous and nonindigenous (externally                controlled) offices, and what proportion of the services sector                 output fill intraservice demand.  It is a field which requires                  elaboration through detailed case studies of individual economies.              This project provides such a case study, examining whether these kinds          of relationships hold true in the context of the powerful and rapidly-          growing city state of Singapore, which promises to have a future role           as the economic, communications and innovation center of the South East         Asian region.",
