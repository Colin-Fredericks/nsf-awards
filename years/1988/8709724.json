 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mammal division of the Texas Cooperative Wildlife                      Collection, at Texas A&M University, has grown steadily since its               inception in 1937 and currently ranks among the 12 largest                      institutional collections of Recent mammals in the United States.               The strength of the mammal division lies primarily in its North                 American material, particularly Texas and New Mexico; however, it               also has nationally important collections from Central and South                America.  Previous NSF awards have funded the reorganization,                   updating and curation of all of the dry materials (skins and                    skeletons) in the collection.                                                        This project will improve access to non-traditional                        preparations, primarily chromosomal and frozen tissue specimens,                by providing support for curating and cross-referencing them to                 the dry specimens.  Funds will be used to purchase equipment and                supplies to improve the physical storage of the ancillary                       preparations and to fund a collection assistant position for one                year.  The mammal division has prepared a model agreement                       specifying the ground rules for making loans of the non-                        traditional specimens to scientists throughout the country and                  for accessioning new ancillary specimens into the collection.",
