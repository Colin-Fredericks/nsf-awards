 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nearby galaxies which have an unusually large amount of neutral                 hydrogen gas can be studied by radio astronomical                               techniques.  The objectives of the observations will be to define               the gaseous structures of large, gas-rich galaxies and to see if                there are dynamical processes at work now that might have been                  important in the past.                                                                                                                                          A collaborative program that uses the new receiving systems at                  the Westerbork (The Netherlands) Synthesis Radio Telescope                      (WSRT) will be initiated to study the highly redshifted 21 cm                   wavelength absorption line of hydrogen gas.  The instrument is                  uniquely suited to this type of experiment.  The optical survey                 work on the galaxies which is already in progress will provide                  candidates for study at radio wavelengths.  It is important to                  emphasize that radio astronomy techniques complement the                        optical data by providing:  (1) Very Long Baseline                              Interferometric (VLBI) measurements of the spatial extent of the                absorbing gas, (2) the neutral hydrogen gas (HI) temperature                    estimates, and (3) details of the kinematics in the high column                 density clouds at the heart of the absorption system.  This                     program will be a collaborative effort with an astronomer from                  the University of Pittsburgh and Netherland astronomers.                                                                                                        VLBI spectral line experiments will be carried out to compete                   with the WSRT.  The galaxy system in PKS 0458-02 (redshift z =                  2.04) is well-suited to more detailed study.  There is radio                    structure in the background source on a wide range of scales, and               the absorption itself is very strong.  The precision of the                     spectral line VLBI observations of this system will be improved                 and intermediate-length baseline experiments will be attempted,                 which should  detect the structure in the absorber on typical                   galactic scales.  A four-station VLBI experiment including WSRT,                Arecibo, Green Bank, and Jodrell Bank would be very useful since                the WSRT-Jodrell Bank baseline would be short enough to define                  the absorption in front of the large (about 2 arcsecond)                        structure.  The intercontinental baselines would detect the fine                structure in the absorber against the more compact components.                  Both Arecibo and Green Bank are already equipped with receivers.                Jodrell Bank is planning to build a low noise preamplifier in                   order to include the 250-foot telescope in the experiment.                                                                                                      Since receiving systems have improved by a factor of about 4 in                 sensitivity since the previous experiment was performed, the                    VLBI observations of the lower redshift systems (z = 0.69) in the               spectrum of 3C286 will be repeated.  The inclusion of WSRT and                  Jodrell Bank in this experiment would be of great interest since                the background radio source in 3C286, like PKS 0458-020, has                    structure on a wide range of scales.  The results of the project                should improve our understanding of the structure and evolution                 of galaxies.",
