 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mechanisms regulating social homeostasis in a complex insect                society will be studied by integrating behavioral, genetic, and                 physiological analyses of honey bee social organization.                        Behavioral mechanisms thought to contribute to flexible colony                  responses to environmental change will be studied under                         experimental conditions and, for the first time, during natural                 changes in social structure that occur as a result of colony                    fission and the honey bee's unique mode of overwintering.  A                    hormonal mechanism known to regulate individual worker                          behavioral development will be probed further to determine                      whether it also acts as a colony integrating mechanism by                       altering behavioral thresholds in response to environmental and                 colony conditions.  All experimental bees used in these                         investigations will bear genetic markers, enabling determination                of possible genotypic differences in both behavioral and                        physiological aspects of worker plasticity.  These studies                      promise to provide a comprehensive account of the mechanisms                    governing social insect behavioral plasticity, and so contribute                toward the fundamental goal of understanding colony integration                 in the insect societies. The work will proceed for two years at                 Ohio State University under sponsorship of a postdoctoral                       fellowship in environmental biology.",
