 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine the impact of two interactive                    information processing tools on science teaching and learning at                                                                                                lower undergraduate and upper high school levels.  These tools,                 which have emerged from our prior research on technical and                     academic learning strategies are:  Concept Mapping, a method of                 converting information to two-dimensional node-link displays, and                                                                                                                                                                               Scripted Cooperation, an approach to orchestrating the joint                    processing of information by peer dyads.  These tools will be                   used independently and interactively to enhance the extraction of                                                                                                                                                                               scientific knowledge from experts, the presentation                                                                                                             of this knowledge to students, and the subsequent processing of                 the communicated information.  Expert maps of biological and                    statistical concepts will be developed and used in a series of                  six experiments designed to assess the impact of the information                                                                                                processing tools on a variety of science education outcomes.                    These experiments, which will involve approximately 660 college                 freshmen and high school seniors, will also examine Aptitude X                  Treatment interactions and transfer to other learning situations.                                                                                                                                                                               The results of this experimentation will be used to further                     develop a model of science education and will be used as a basis                                                                                                for developing implementation materials for practitioners.",
