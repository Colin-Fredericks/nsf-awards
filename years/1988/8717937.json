 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will attempt to understand the                            organization and regulation of genes that behave in a                           peculiar manner when moved next to heterochromatin, the                         cytologically compacted regions of chromosomes.  Two genes,                     the Drosophila melanogaster brown and karmoisin loci, are                       affected in both cis and trans by such rearrangements.                          Almost all other genes that are similarly juxtaposed are                        affected only in cis.  Of the various models that have been                     invoked to explain these anomalies, one which proposed                          closely linked trans-acting regulators is supported by the                      results of our initial molecular investigation of the brown                     locus, in which we find that brown lies just between the                        copies of a duplicated gene.  Another model which proposed                      that dominant variegation is caused by the production of                        anti-sense RNA is also consistent with the unusual                              organization of the region around brown.  Yet another                           possibility is that heterochromatin can directly inactivate                     transcription on the homologous chromosome.  In any case, it                    appears that the unusual behavior of the brown locus in                         response to position effects results from a novel form of                       gene organization or regulation.  A thorough molecular                          characterization of both brown and karmoisin and the regions                    around them will be done.                                                                                                                                       The results of this work should bear on general questions of                    regulatory interactions in complex eukaryotes and of position                   effects which can lead to abnormal expression of genes.",
