Specific studies will              include analysis of patterns of particle deposition on surfaces in              contact with blood, analysis of patterns of particle deposition during          electroplating, measurement of interactions of biological cells with            surfaces, characterization of the structure of porous media, and                analysis of CAT scan images of two-phase flow in porous media.                                                                                                  The information to be obtained should illuminate processes occurring            in systems with truly complex geometry of the type often encountered            with practical operations on energy and materials processing.  The              work with blood and cells should help develop improved materials for            blood processing and bioreactors.",
