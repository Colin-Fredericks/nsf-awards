 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                     Organometallic Chemistry Program is the synthesis and                           characterization of organometallic compounds containing                         transition elements in previously unknown, extremely low                        oxidation states. Building on the recent synthesis of carbonyl                  and organophosphine compounds containing zerovalent titanium,                   zirconium and hafnium, prepared by reduction of metal halides                   with sodium napthenide, the synthesis of the first examples of                  metal carbonyls of scandium, yttrium and 4f block elements will                 be attempted. A significant component of the research will be                   to determine the factors which are important in the synthesis                   and stabilization of zero and subvalent carbonyls of the group                  4 and 4f block elements. The use of potential acceptor ligands                  other than carbon monoxide, such as alkenes, alkynes,                           conjugated dienes and dinitrogen, will be examined also to                      assess more fully the potential of low-valent early transition                  elements in chemical synthesis.                                                                                                                                 This project is expected to provide powerful new reagents for                   chemical synthesis, and to provide new routes to materials                      which previously could be prepared only in small amounts by                     metal atom vapor syntheses.",
