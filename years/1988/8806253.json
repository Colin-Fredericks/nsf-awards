 "awd_abstract_narration": "The modern chemist relies on a number of instruments to                         characterize molecules and to handle and interpret vast                         quantities of data.  Mass Spectrometry (MS) and Nuclear                         Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy are crucial to the former                 and modern computers are essential to the latter.  State-of-the                 art MS, NMR and computer instrumentation is indespensible for                   the execution of frontier research in chemistry.                                                                                                                The Department of Chemistry at Columbia University will use                     this multi-instrument award from the Chemistry Shared                           Instrumentation Program to help acquire a Mass Spectrometer,                    computer equipment, and components to improve departmental NMR                  spectrometers.  Included among the areas of chemical research                   that will be enhanced by these acquisitions are the following:                                                                                                  1)  Quantum solvation and dynamics                                              2)  Chemical model systems relevant to enzymatic processes                      3)  Novel antiaromatic compounds and their solid state                              properties                                                                  4)  Synthesis of polymeric metallocenes                                         5)  Structural bioorganic studies of bioactive compounds                        6)  Synthesis of natural and unnatural ionophores                               7)  Structure and dynamics of starburst polymers.",
