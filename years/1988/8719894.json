 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative studies in physical volcanology and experimental                  petrology on products of explosive eruptions of El Chichon (1982)               and Vesuvius (79 AD) have elucidated the dependence of eruption                 processes on magma properties.  Variation in mass eruption rate                 during the 79 A.D. Vesuvius eruption produced complex                           compositional gradients in the erupted products, as two                         contrasting magmas were mixed during withdrawal from the chamber.               The extent of mixing is closely linked to mass eruption rate, as                proposed on theoretical grounds for compositionally-stratified                  reservoirs, and demonstrates that geochemical gradients in                      volcanic deposits can only be interpreted in conjunction with                   information about eruption dynamics.  Modelling of the Vesuvius                 and El Chichon sequences using petrologically-inferred intensive                parameters has shown that the evolution of eruptive processes is                consistent with current models of eruption column behavior and                  that differences between events at the two centers can be                       attributed to contrasting volatile contents, crystallinity and                  viscosity of their respective magmas.  New techniques in physical               volcanology have now provided the means to calculate the                        intensity (mass eruption rate) of recent and ancient explosive                  eruptions.  Analysis of the available global data base on                       intensity and magnitude (total volume of erupted magma) of                      explosive eruptions reveals a close correlation, suggesting a                   dependence of intensity on magnitude and in turn, on reservoir                  size.  Eruptions with intensities in excess of 2x10-8 kg/s are                  invariably associated with major pyroclastic flow generation and                caldera collapse.  A correlation also exists between the runout                 distance of pyroclastic flows and the intensity of the preceding                plinian phase.  The predictive power of these observations is of                great significance to volcanic hazards studies.  This project                   will continue work in physical volcanology and experimental                     petrology and apply the results of previous studies to an                       investigation of intensity, magnitude, and magmatic composition                 of ancient explosive eruptions from the Cascade Range of the U. S.              The study should contribute to an understanding of eruptive                     processes, magma evolution and hazards assessment of this region.",
