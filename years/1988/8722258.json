 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Rosensteil School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences at the                 University of Miami will acquire several items of oceanographic                 instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use equipment.  This           equipment is maintained for use on or in association with the two               research vessels the institution operates.  A substantial part of the           ships' operating schedule during 1988 is in support of NSF-sponsored            research projects.  The instrumentation will also increase the                  capabilities of the ships and of the University to support research and         engineering activities.  The instrumentation includes:                                                                                                          -A disk drive system and other peripheral equipment for increasing               shared-use, sea-going computing capabilities,                                  -a deck control unit for a device (CTD) that collects precision                  Temperature and Conductivity data as a function of Depth,                      -precision temperature sensors for the CTD,                                     -probe and firmware for improving dissolved oxygen measurements,                -a thermosalinograph for continuously monitoring and recording sea               surface temperature and salinity while the ship is underway,                   -replacement water sampling bottles for collecting discrete seawater             samples at specific depths, and                                                -an uninterruptable power supply laboratory computer equipment.                                                                                                 The instrumentation described above will increase the capability of the         Institution to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects.",
