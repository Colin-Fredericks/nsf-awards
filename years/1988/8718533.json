 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under a previous RUI (Research in Undergraduate Institutions)                   grant, Cadmus has established the equipment and reduction                       procedures needed to monitor photometrically about three dozen                  semiregular variable stars.  He shall monitor those stars during                the next three years, as originally planned.  Cadmus recently                   observed one variable star to change its period during a quiescent              state.  Interesting results will also be pursued                                spectroscopically.                                                                                                                                              Many stars grow and shrink regularly.  The observation of their                 pulsations has provided much information about stellar interiors                and evolution.  Now interest grows in understanding stars that                  appear to pulsate irregularly, perhaps occasionally changing                    pulsation modes.  They are likely to provide qualitatively new                  insights into stellar structure.  Cadmus has established a program              to measure the brightness of selected irregularly variable stars                over long enough time periods so that the causes of the                         irregularity may be identified.  This grant supports the                        monitoring program and the spectroscopic follow-up of interesting               results.  Students are closely involved in this research, and                   support is provided under both the Research in Undergraduate                    Institutions and the Research Experiences for Undergraduates                    programs.",
