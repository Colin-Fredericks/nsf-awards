 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dynamical and chemical evolution of hot gas in elliptical                   galaxies will be studied.  Gas ejected from orbiting stars in                   these galaxies is heated by mutual dissipation and supernova                    explosions to about 10 million degrees Celsius.  Late in the                    evolution of massive elliptical galaxies for current supernova                  rates, this gas is trapped in the deep potential wells of the dark              halos and slowly cools into the centers of galaxies, emitting                   observable soft X-rays.  Investigations of what combinations of                 dark halo structures and supernova rates are consistent with                    observed X-ray luminosities will be carried out.  An evolutionary               calculation of gas flow that matches observed X-ray luminosities                would establish the total amount of gas that cooled into the                    galactic center.  Knowledge of the total mass ejected from                      evolving stars provides a good estimate of the total stellar mass               in the upper main sequence beyond the current turnoff.  The total               amount of matter that cooled into the galactic core is limited                  since it must not distort the observed stellar surface brightness.                                                                                              With this constraint, the evolutionary calculations can be used to              infer quantitative information about the initial mass function of               the galactic stars, the history of supernova activity, and the                  amount of primordial gas present after galactic formation or added              afterwards.  Preliminary calculations will be verified, based on                likely stellar and supernova properties, that indicate massive                  ellipticals were swept clean shortly after formation by supernova-              driven galactic winds which later turned into cooling flows with                relatively little matter flow into the galactic cores.  In                      addition, the chemical enrichment and abundance gradients in the                winds and cooling flows will be calculated.  These metallicity                  gradients will provide information about past supernova activity.               These studies will also be extended to low mass and dwarf                       ellipticals and to hot galactic flows in spiral galaxies which are              believed may tend to be winds rather than cooling flows.//",
