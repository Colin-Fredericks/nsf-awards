 "awd_abstract_narration": "Analysis of ice deformation data from laboratories and from field               measurements on glaciers, coupled with preliminary biaxial creep                experiments, suggest that stress configuration (stresses acting in              directions other that the direction in which the strain rate is                 measured) may effect the deformation rate of ice much more than                 that suggested by Glenn's Flow Law.  This study will involve                    prepared ice in simple shear and in simple shear with simultaneous              compression in a cold laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-                River Falls.  These experiments will test the accuracy of Glen's                Flow Law, which assumes independence from the third invariant in                describing deformation of ice under biaxial stresses.  Results                  should allow, if necessary, modification of the flow law to a more              general form based on both the second and third variants.  A                    second part of this study will involve conducting combined stress               tests on glacier ice samples exhibiting a broad range of crystal                fabrics and grain sizes to investigate the form of the flow law                 for anisotropic ice.",
