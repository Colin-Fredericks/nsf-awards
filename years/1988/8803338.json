 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the Second International Congress for Plant                      Molecular Biology is to provide an open forum for the                           presentation of recent research findings in the area of plant                   molecular biology in its broadest sense, and to promote the                     exchange of ideas, concepts and technological advances among                    scientists throughout the world.  Attendance is open to anyone                  interested in plant molecular biology world wide as is the                      opportunity to present experimental results through oral or                     poster presentations.  It is anticipated that research workers in               plant molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, physiology,                    pathology and tissue culture on both the basic and applied level                will participate in the Congress.  The need and usefulness of the               Congress can be assessed by the success of the first Congress in                Savannah, USA in 1985 which had 2,000 attendees from 39                         countries, and by the response to the first circular of this                    Congress to which over 2,000 scientists have replied to date.                   This, in turn, attests to the dynamic, exciting status that plant               molecular biology is experiencing, which can be attributed to the               rapid advances in the field and to the potential impact of this                 field on world agriculture.                                                                                                                                     Support by the National Science Foundation will permit partial                  travel awards of $500 each to approximately 30 young                            investigators who will be presenting research at the Congress.                  This will help assure adequate representation of young U.S.                     scientists at this important international meeting.",
