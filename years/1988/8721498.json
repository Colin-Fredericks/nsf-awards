 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of mass spectrometry.  The primary                thrust of this experimental program is the development of a                     Fourier transform mass spectrometer (FTMS) with which ultrahigh                 mass resolution and mass accuracy measurements can be made at                   significantly improved signal-to-noise ratios.  Central to these                instrumentation improvements is the reduction of magnetic field                 static inhomogeneity in the 7 Tesla superconducting solenoid by                 constructing the trapped-ion cell from non-magnetic materials and               employing new cell geometries, exploration of the nature and                    limits to noise in the FTMS instrument, and enhancement of the                  analytical signal relative to this noise through use of new                     excitation and detection techniques.  Further improvements in FTMS              sensitivity, especially for difficult-to-ionize samples, can be                 expected with the use of a newly developed fast neutral beam ion                source.                                                                                                                                                         Applications of this improved instrument to various analytical and              mechanistic problems should give rise to new insights in the                    chemistry and physics of clusters, in the characterization of                   polymers, in gas phase ion-molecule chemistry, and in the                       characterization of electrode surface constituents.  Additionally,              the improved FTMS technology that derives from this research can                be expected to impact broadly and positively in the biosciences.",
