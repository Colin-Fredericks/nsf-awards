 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Glascock will establish an archaeometric center at the                      University of Missouri and employ the technique of instrumental                 neutron activation analysis (INAA) to analyze the elemental                     composition of archaeological materials.  INAA is a                             multielemental technique which allows the major, minor and trace                elements of a material to be determined simultaneously and with                 considerable accuracy and precision.  A sample is not destroyed                 by INAA and, as a result, the analysis can be repeated or                       different analytical techniques can be applied to the same                      sample.  For valuable archaeological objects, this is an                        important consideration.  Of particular interest are potential                  analyses of ceramics, lithics, metal and bone.  Dr. Glascock will               announce the availability of the facility to the anthropological                community and establish a national review committee to evaluate                 the importance of samples submitted for analysis.                                                                                                               Through elemental analysis of archaeological materials, a number                of significant kinds of questions can be addressed.  INAA                       provides a taxonomic tool because it allows materials of similar                composition to be grouped together.  In some instances, it also                 permits the proveniencing of artifacts and thus may provide                     information about procurement practices, routes of trade and                    political boundaries.  It may also improve understanding of                     ancient technologies and (through analysis of skeletal remains)                 give insight into prehistoric diet and nutrition.                                                                                                               This project is particularly important because the two                          laboratories, which for many years have provided this service to                archaeologists, have recently shifted their foci elsewhere.  The                University of Missouri center will fill an important gap and make               its services available on a nationwide basis.",
