The board, operating through its standing               and ad hoc committees and panels, will:                                                                                                                         1.  Continue to provide scientific leadership and guidance to the               federal government on important national and international issues               in the atmospheric sciences and climate, and on the coordination                between discipline-orinted activities within the atmospheric                    sciences and interdisciplinary programs such as the International               Geosphere-Biosphere Program.                                                                                                                                    2.  Continue the activities of th eClimate Research Committee                   (CRC) and the Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere (TOGA) and                       International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP)                       Advisory Panels in providing guidance to the Federal agencies on                U.S. participation in the World Climate Research Program (WCRP)                 and on related national climate research activities.                                                                                                            3.  Continue the activities of the Committee on Solar-Terrestrial               Research, including participationin the activitis of the                        International Special Committee on Solar-Terrestrial Physics                    (SCOSTEP) and completionof a report on long-term solar-                         terrestrial observations.                                                                                                                                       4. Organize a new standing Committee on Meteorological Analysis,                Prediction, and Research in order to provide a focus for                        scientific oversight and assessment of basic and applied research               in meteorology, weather prediction, atmospheric physics, cloud                  physics, weather modification, turbulence/diffusion, and allied                 core areas of the atmospheric sciences.                                                                                                                         5.  Continue the activities of the Committee on Atmospheric                     Chemistry.  The Committee will focus its efforts on the                         fundamental scientific questions raised by contemporary                         atmospheric changes, e.g., increases in greenhouse gases,                       stratospheric ozone depletion, and acid deposition.                                                                                                             6.
