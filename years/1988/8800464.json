 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant continues ground-based optical studies in support               of CEDAR program objectives concerning upper atmosphere and                     ionosphere coupling and dynamics.  These optical observations are               made using Fabry-Perot interferometers (FPI), tilting-filter                    photometers and mapping filter photometers, often in conjunction                with incoherent scatter radars or other optical apparatus.  The                 research is a logical continuation of the studies carried out                   under the present grant at three optical observatories; the                     Laurel Ridge Airglow Observatory (LRAO) in Pennsylvania, the                    Arequipa Automated Airglow Observatory (A30) in Peru and Pitt                   Automated Airglow Observatory (PAAO) at Millstone Hill,                         Massachusetts, in operation since May 1986.                                          The major emphasis of the work under the present grant has                 been the development of a capability to make simultaneous, co-                  located optical measurements (neutral thermosphere dynamics) and                radar measurements (ionospheric plasma dynamics) on a continuing                basis.  The automated airglow observatory at Arequipa, Peru was                 our first effort in this area, and initial comparisons of the                   motions of the thermosphere (measured by the Jicamarca radar)                   indicate the transition from E-region control of the plasma drift               to control by the neutral wind.  The optical observations at                    Arequipa using the FPI and its companion tilting filter                         photometer will continue.  Further, the observational                           capabilities will be improved by the addition of a sky-mapping                  filter photometer to determine the morphology of equatorial                     airglow depletions and enhancements.",
