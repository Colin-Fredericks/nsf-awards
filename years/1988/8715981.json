The study will gather data on the organizational                    structure, staffing, and the curriculum used for pre-service and                in-service education of teachers of science at the elementary,                  junior high and senior high levels in the U.S. and Japan.  The                  Japanese and U.S. research teams will synthesize their findings                 and present the results at a joint conference on Comparative                    Science Teacher Education in May 1989 to be held in Honolulu,                   Hawaii.                                                                                                                                                         Science educators in the United States have much to learn from a                comparative study of American and Japanese teacher education                    since Japanese students consistently outscore U.S. students on                  standardized science achievement tests at every pre-college                     level.  The teams, under the direction of Professor Coble and                   Professor Takemura,  are composed of well established and highly                respected science educators in both countries.",
