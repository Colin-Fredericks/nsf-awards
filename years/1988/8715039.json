 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research on the topic of                  protein chemistry between Dr. Mark Olson, University of                         Mississippi Medical Center and Dr. Francois Amalric, Center for                 Research in Biochemistry and Cellular Genetics of the French                    National Center for Scientific Research in Toulouse, France.  The               objective of the proposed research is to elucidate the                          relationship of the structure to the function of nucleolin, a                   preribosomal RNA binding protein.  The work will focus on the                   role of phosphorylation of nucleolin and the identification of                  the nucleic acid binding domains of the protein.                                                                                                                This collaboration is mutually beneficial because of the common                 interest of the U.S. and French labs in the protein and the                     complementarity of expertise and facilities.  The Toulouse group                has expertise in cell culture and nucleic acids methods.  The                   U.S. lab has expertise and facilities for protein chemistry and                 the ability to isolate greater quantities of the protein,                       facilitating progress at the protein and posttranslational                      level.  The projects proposed require a chemical approach (to be                done in the U.S.) as well as an advanced knowledge of the protein               sequence, manipulation of cells and isolation of cell fractions                 (provided by Dr. Amalric's group).  Without the collaboration and               exchange of information, the project would proceed at a much                    slower pace with considerable duplication of effort.  Completion                of the proposed studies will enable both labs to clarify the role               of phosphorylation of nucleolin and the mechanism of nucleic acid               binding by this and other proteins which share the RNP consensus                sequence.  This should provide a foundation for further studies                 on structure-function relationships in nucleolin and its role in                ribosome biogenesis.",
