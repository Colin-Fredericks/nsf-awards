 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to encourage a greater percentage of talented students to              pursue careers in mathematics, the physical sciences, and engineering,          college teachers must be knowledgeable in the applications of                   mathematics and recent developments which should be incorporated into           the undergraduate curriculum.  Instruction to college teachers of               mathematics through summer short courses and workshops has proven to be         one mechanism to accomplish these goals.                                                                                                                        A week-long short course will be conducted for undergraduate college            teachers of mathematics on the topic of mathematical modeling.  The             objectives of the short course are to provide college teachers in the           mathematical sciences with the knowledge necessary to supplement                existing courses with mathematical models, develop mathematical modeling        courses at their home institutions, and educate colleagues through              seminars and workshops.  There will be twelve hours of in-class                 instruction on models suitable for undergraduate students together with         the associate pedagogy.  There will be an additional six hours of in-           class discussion in which specific mathematical models will be                  developed and participant assignments will be discussed.  Computers and         associated software will be used by the instructors and students in the         development and solution of models.                                                                                                                             In addition to NSF support, participants will contribute about 15% in           travel costs, and staff will contribute another 15% of their time.",
