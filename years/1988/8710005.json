 "awd_abstract_narration": "As agents of decomposition and mineral re-cycling, fungi are            ecologically important throughout the world but are poorly known.               Dr. Jack Rogers of Washington State University is studying one                  such group, the white-rot genus Xylaria, with an estimated 150                  species in the world. Most species decay wood, cause root-rots of               trees, or decay fruits, seeds, and leaves. Some species are                     associated with termite or ant nests. Despite their ecological                  importance and worldwide distribution, basic taxonomic knowledge                of the group is rudimentary and the life-cycles of only are few                 are understood in detail. Dr. Rogers will work on U.S. species of               the group and also on neotropical collections provided by several               collaborators, the aims being comprehensive descriptions of the                 species and their geographical distributions, useful                            identification keys, and accounts of their basic life-cycles and                food-preferences. Techniques of study include laboratory                        culturing of the organisms, artificial host-plant inoculation                   where appropriate, and study of morphology by light and electron                microscopy.",
