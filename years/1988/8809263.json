 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mediation, which involves a third party who attempts to                         facilitate voluntary agreements between two or more                             disputing parties, is an important component of industrial,                     international, and organizational disputes.  Past research has                  provided little systematic information about mediation, and                     virtually no theory.  This research is designed to develop a                    better understanding of the antecedents and consequences of                     mediation, and to evaluate its effectiveness.  The                              investigators have developed a theory of mediation that                         proposes that mediator incentives and mediator beliefs about                    the likelihood of agreement interact to predict mediator                        strategy and negotiator responses to mediation.  The results of                 preliminary experiments support the theory, and thirteen                        laboratory experiments have been designed to test additional                    hypothses derived from the theory and related propositions.                     The hypotheses concern the impact of mediator expertise and                     accountability on mediator perceptions and mediator choice of                   strategy; the behavior of biased mediators; the impact of                       expected mediator strategy, incentives, and two forms of                        mediator bias on negotiator receptivity to mediation; the                       effect of recommendations from expert and powerful mediators;                   and the impact of negotiator-mediator continuity on the                         effectiveness of mediation.  In the experiments, subjects                       interact in simulated mediation and negotiation sessions.  A                    record of their interaction is extensively coded.  Outcome                      measures include negotiation and mediation tactics, negotiator                  offers, mediation recommendations, and the quality of                           agreements.  The results of this research will be important for                 understanding how mediators function in different types of                      disputes where performance is dependent on optimal conditions,                  effective diagnosis of disputes, and the use of appropriate                     strategies.  The results will suggest whether training and                      evaluation programs for mediators should stress contingencies                   in mediation, the idea being that certain mediator behaviors                    are effective in some circumstances and not in others.  And the                 results will indicate possible important directions for future                  theory and research to evaluate and understand these                            contingencies.",
