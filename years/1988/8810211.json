 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop is concerned with the physics of substantially                    compressible turbulent mixing processes.  In these flows, shock waves           or shocklet patterns may interact with and significantly modulate the           turbulence; and there may be strong coupling between mean and                   fluctuating components of the acoustic, entropy, and velocity fields.           Descriptions of lower speed flow processes also are sought if they              supply insight on the source and evolution of developing high-speed             compressible features.                                                                                                                                          The workshop is being organized by scientists from the Lawrence                 Livermore National Laboratory, the Los Alamos National Laboratory,              Princeton University, the AWE-Aldermaston, U.K., and Imperial College,          London, U.K.  The organizers seek an approximate balance between                experimental and numerical/                                                     theoretical papers. Potential contributions from Europe, the Soviet             Union, Japan, China, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United             States are being invited.                                                                                                                                       Publication of the longer papers and a general summary of the                   discussions will appear as a bound volume of the Springer-Verlag                series.                                                                                                                                                         It is expected that the dissemination of this state-of-the-art                  review of the role of compressibility in turbulent flows, will                  accelerate the advent of more realistic predictive models in a                  variety of practical fluid dynamic situations.",
