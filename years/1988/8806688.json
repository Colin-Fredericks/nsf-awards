 "awd_abstract_narration": "Members of the genus Culicoides are biting flies known to                  transmit viral diseases in some parts of the world.  Dr. Carol                  Pappas of Peru State College in Nebraska proposes a study of the                morphological variability of several species of the genus in                    North America.  These species were chosen because of their                      preference for tree-hole habitats, which can be characterised in                terms of height, moisture content, and ambient environment.  By                 characterising both the morphological variation in local                        populations and the associated environment, Dr. Pappas will build               a database that will facilitate a modern systematic treatment of                the group as a whole.  Data acquisition will be accomplished with               a microcomputer-based image analysis system.  In addition, the                  project will analyze the degree to which geographically                         peripheral or ecologically marginal populations vary, relative to               central populations.                                                                 The \"central-peripheral variation hypothesis\" is of wide                   interest throughout ecology and evolutionary biology.  This                     research effort will provide a uniquely detailed and thorough                   case study of this phenomenon.  The proposal was submitted under                two NSF Cross Directorate activities: Research at Undergraduate                 Institutions and Research Opportunities for Women.  The proposal                will instruct undergraduates in the entire research process, from               sampling design, through the use of a state-of-the-art                          morphometrics system, to the statistical analysis and                           interpretation of results.  The project will also complete Dr.                  Pappas' return to research following a family-related                           interruption.",
