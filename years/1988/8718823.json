 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Stanford University will allow the investigator to                conduct research on the social history of the Ethiopian                         revolution as it was experienced in a remote area of the country                from 1974 to 1984.  The investogator has extensive experience in                the country and will study the role of religion as it influenced                the course of social change.  The hypothesis of the  project is                 that the \"top-down\" nature of the Ethiopian revolution makes it a               fundamentally different sort of social process than the \"bottom-                up\" revolutionary experiences of China and Russia.                                                                                                              This research is important because it builds upon the                           researcher's extensive prior experience with the Ethiopian social               situation to allow him to explain the local significance of the                 revolution.  In a world in which political unrest is pervasive,                 such a contribution to our understanding of how revolutions are                 experienced will help us deal with the different countries of the               world as they work out their different political arrangements.",
