 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry in the Community (ChemCom) was designed to provide an                 attractive, open access route for all high school students to the realm         of relevant and useful chemical phenomena.  What began as a dream a few         years ago is now a well-developed high school program brought about by          the concerted efforts of high school teachers, college and university           professors, and industrial chemists and financed by the National Science        Foundation and the American Chemical Society.  This three-year project          is designed as a partnership to support the dissemination of the Chemcom        curriculum.  Specially selected teachers will be educated so that they          can become resource teachers who will conduct ChemCom inservice                 workshops throughout the country.  These resource teachers are expected         to represent as many as 150 school systems and will reach as many as            2,000 teachers with their inservice programs.  The project also includes        a series of networking activities entitled \"An Evening with ChemCom, the        establishment of a computer network, and the production of a newsletter.        The evaluation will focus on the effectiveness of this particular model         for implementing curriculum change.                                                                                                                             The total cost sharing (ACS, Publisher, School Systems) is expected to          be almost five times the NSF request.",
