 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between                          Prof. Nancy Kleckner of Harvard University and                                  Dr. Olivier Huisman of the Institut Pasteur, Paris, in                          the area of genetic analysis of mutant proteins.  The                           objective of this work is the structural and                                    functional dissection of DNA sequences at the ends of                           a gene segment, which is capable of moving from place                           to place in the chromosomes of an organism.  Such a                             gene segment is called a transposon; the particular                             transposon to be studied in this work is called Tn10.                           Transposition of transposons leads to mutation, and                             the mutations which occur are to be studied by both                             genetic and biochemical methods.  In the latter,                                assays for the binding of important proteins to                                 specific DNA sequences should reveal the effects of                             specific mutations on known processes, and could show                           new intermediates in the reaction which might                                   accumulate due to intermediate mutational steps.                                                                                                                The French collaborators have considerable experience                           in genetic analysis.  Additional materials, as well as                          expertise in use of an in vitro biochemical system for                          analysis of the Tn10 transposition, will be brought to                          the project by the U.S. investigator.  The knowledge                            of complex interactions between DNA and proteins that                           is expected to result from this research could lead to                          enhanced progress in our understanding of the                                   processes of the generation, and therefore of                                   alteration, of life itself.",
