 "awd_abstract_narration": "New Zealand streams near the Hope fault have responded                     rapidly to late Quaternary uplift and climatic changes, and thus                are ideal for the development of new concepts.  These powerful                  streams cut broad straths in bedrock at about 30,000 years ago,                 and at the present.  Confirmation of the 30,000 years age                       estimate, and measuring amounts of stream-channel downcutting                   since then, will (1) identify active faults and folds and (2)                   provide the data for a regional map of late Quaternary uplift                   rates.  This map will be used to separate local from regional                   uplift and to describe subareas with different tectonic styles                  that have results from the oblique convergence of the Pacific and               Australian plates.  Stream-gradient indices describe variations in              channel slope and will be used to further examine amounts of                    recent faulting and to study rates of upstream migration of                     rapids and waterfalls caused by faulting in streams in with                     different amounts of power.  Terrace tread and strath surfaces                  will also be evaluated as time lines passing through rapidly                    deforming landscapes.                                                                Stream terraces are common in the valleys of the western                   United States, but are not as suitable for efficient and complete               testing of the tectonic model as the more abundant and extensive                New Zealand terraces.  Concepts and methods resulting from this                 study will be applicable to many other tectonically active                      regions, with different climates, rock erodibility, terrace ages,               and streams power.  After thorough testing in New Zealand, the                  proposed model should be used as a new approach to better define                areas of high seismic risk in the western United States.",
