 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bacterivory is a key process in understanding the flux of                  matter and energy through the microbial loop and the control of                 bacterial abundance in the oceans.  Of the various approaches to                measuring grazing impact on bacteria, three of the most promising               and widely used methods - inhibitors, dilution, and fluorescent                 particles - rest on tenuous assumptions regarding the effects of                experimental manipulations on the behaviors on bacterial                        consumers. The primary objective of this study is to develop                    recombination-deficient, UV sensitive strains of marine bacteria                (i.e. cells that will continue to function but cannot divide                    following brief exposure to UV light).  These cells will be used                to test the assumptions of the field methods and elucidate                      feeding behaviors (e.g. size selection) of bacterivorous                        protozoa.                                                                            Bacteria are ubiquitous in the marine environment and range                in concentration from hundreds of thousands to millions per cubic               centimeter.  However, our understanding of the nature and impact                of marine bacteria on marine biological systems is limited.  For                example, the degree to which bacteria are eaten by larger marine                organisms and fuel production in the marine food web is unclear.                This is mainly due to the difficulty in quantifying grazing rates               on these minute organisms.  This work will apply a novel                        application of biotechnology to the study of bacterial grazing.                 Bacteria will be genetically altered so that after exposure to a                small amount of a certain kind of light (called ultraviolet), the               bacteria will not be able to divide, although they will continue                to function.  Thus, such altered bacteria can serve as analogs                  for normal bacteria and grazing rates can be estimated from their               rate of disappearance.  In addition to the importance of making                 better measurements of such rates, this type of biotechnology may               prove useful in a variety of other oceanographic applications.",
