 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research outlined in this proposal will examine the                    genetic and evolutionary consequences of inbreeding in a                        population of the self-fertilizing annual plant, Polygonum                      douglasii.  Inbreeding occurs frequently in natural populations                 of animals and plants, and has several important genetic                        consequences which tend to reduce the overall genetic variation                 in a population via random genetic drift.  One extreme form of                  inbreeding is exhibited by plants which habitually self-fertilize               their seeds and do not rely on pollen from other plants.  Self-                 fertilizing plant populations are quite common in both wild and                 crop species.  These populations are thought to contain no                      genetic variability for ecologically important traits and                       therefore can not respond to natural selection in different                     environments.  In this sense they are thought to be                             \"evolutionary dead-ends.\"  This belief has not yet been                         thoroughly tested, but some recent theoretical and experimental                 results suggest that substantial genetic variation may be                       present within even highly selfing populations.                                      This study will test hypotheses regarding genetic                          variability and adaptation to specific environments by relating                 the pattern of genetic differentiation in ecologically important                traits to (1) the level of inbreeding, (2) the local                            environments, and (3) the spatial scale of local adaptation in a                single large population of P. douglasii. Breeding experiments in                the greenhouse and transplantations in the field will evaluate                  the extent to which this population contains sufficient genetic                 variation to adapt to different environments.  The experiments                  will also address whether the population is in fact adapted to a                natural range of environments in the field. This study will help                to clarify many controversies regarding the evolutionary                        potential of inbreeding species,  issues which are important in                 designing strategies for improving the ability of the many                      selfing crop species to thrive in a wide range of environments.",
