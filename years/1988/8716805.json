 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atmospheric tides are maintained by a continual supply of                  energy from the sun and moon. This energy is acquired by                        absorption of solar radiation in the lower and middle atmosphere,               and from solar radiation in the lower and middle atmosphere, and                from gravitational tide forces, which act in the lower                          atmosphere.  The energy thus supplied is used to overcome                       internal dissipation.  The energy balance must also account for                 the exchange of energy between the atmosphere and the underlying                ocean and solid earth.                                                               The aim of this research is to make a quantitative                         assessment of the sources and sinks of atmospheric tidal energy.                The lunar semidiurnal tide is the simplest case, because it is                  excited only by gravitational forces. This makes it possible to                 infer the dissipation from the observed distribution of tidal                   pressure at the earth's surface.  The solar diurnal tide,                       although purely thermal in origin, is a more difficult case                     because the dissipation can be estimated only by numerical                      modeling.  The largest atmospheric tide--the solar semidiurnal--                is the most complicated from the standpoint of energy balance,                  because it has both gravitational and thermal excitations.  It,                 too, requires numerical modeling.                                                    Professor Platzman is a renowned meteorologist with                        considerable experience with various problems of tides, both                    atmospheric and oceanic; he is an ideal candidate to pursue the                 proposed work.",
