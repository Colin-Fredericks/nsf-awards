 "awd_abstract_narration": "The most troublesome problem in the philosophy of mathematics                   arises quite early on and quite simply:  if mathematical truths                 are facts about mathematical things, and if mathematical things                 are eternal, unchanging, non-spatiotemporal, etc., as understood                on the common Platonic reading, then how can human beings, with                 the usual cognitive faculties, ever come to know any of these                   truths?  Dr. Maddy has argued in a series of papers over the past               decade that an answer can be found by \"naturalizing\" mathematical               objects, i.e. by taking them to be as familiar as a set of                      encyclopedias on a shelf, and to see the first stages of our                    cognitive contact with them as rooted in ordinary perception.                   Development of this view has led to discussions of the relation                 of sets with numbers, the force of Wittgenstein's philosophy of                 mathematics, and the justification of complex set theoretic                     axioms by methods more familiar in the natural sciences than in                 mathematics as it is usually understood.  Under this current                    grant, Dr. Maddy will bring together her previous work, and                     supplement and extent it in order to make it accessible to                      mathematicians and professional philosophers of science.",
