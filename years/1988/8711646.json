 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concept of apparent thinning of the layer 2A with age               due to seismic anisotropy is the central theme of this research.                According to the P.I., the horizontal velocity in the upper crust               is a much as 40% higher than the velocity measured in the                       vertical direction.  This is due to subhorizontal cracks in the                 uppermost oceanic crust which are most prominent near the                       spreading center.  With age these cracks are filled by alteration               products and this reduces the extent of the anisotropy.  In other               words, the apparent thinning of layer 2A as observed in seismic                 reflection and refraction studies is caused by increase in                      seismic velocities (measured vertically) away from the spreading                axis.  In this award, the P.I. will test this concept by computer               modeling of the existing data and in the process will understand                the mechanism of hydrothermal mineralization in the crust.                      Any such modeling work should be completed before carrying out a                field study.  The P.I. is a capable theoritical geophysicist and                modeler and the study has a very high chance of success.",
