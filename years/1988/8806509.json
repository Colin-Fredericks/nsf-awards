 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Rita Colwell at the University of Maryland will continue               her pioneering investigations into the biology, ecology, and                    evolution of marine bacteria placed in or near the genus Vibrio.                Current work in her laboratory encompasses both classical                       approaches in bacteriology as well as application of new                        molecular methods of ribosomal RNA sequence analysis, to generate               data useful in identification of new strains, often from novel                  environments, and classification of these and better known taxa                 into groups reflective of phylogenetic affinity.  Vibrios and                   related bacteria constitute a significant portion of the                        heterotrophic bacteria of the world's oceans, coastal waters, and               estuaries.  Some of the taxa are commensals of near-shore                       shellfish or of marine animals (including sharks), and others                   cause human diseases.  Hence, the systematics and ecology of the                genus and its close relatives are of major importance for both                  scientific and economic reasons.",
