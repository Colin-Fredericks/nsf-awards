 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research program is to explore the possible use           of the Positron Annihilator Spectroscopy (PAS) technique for mapping            the three-dimensional defect distribution surrounding an extending              crack in brittle materials, such as concrete and structural ceramics.           PAS is a non-destructive and an in-situ method for quantifying hidden           surfaces and defects as small as one angstrom (1/10,000,000,000                 meter) in porous media.  The proposer, Dr. Chong, and his                       collaborator, Dr. Cheng, feel that PAS can also be used to measure              much larger defects of the orders of micron (1/1,000,000 meter) in              dense ceramics and millimeter (1/1,000 meter) in concrete.  Neither             the X-ray nor the ultrasonic techniques, which are currently under              development, provide adequate resolution for such nondestructive                inspection (NDI).  Large defects ahead of the crack tip in a brittle            material will decrease its toughness but clouds of small defects                surrounding and behind the crack tip will increase its toughness.               Since such controlled defects increase the toughness of a brittle               material, it is imperative that the size and location of these defect           be known.  The PAS technique may provide us with a NDI procedure for            this purpose.  Dr. Chong, University of Wyoming, is well known for              his expertise in rock and concrete fracture and Dr. Cheng, University           of Missouri, is well known for his work in PAS.  The cooperative                research between these two faculty members                                      provide an optimum arrangement for this exploratory study.",
