The scope of the               collections in terms of species representation (80% of the                      world's species in the skin collection, 20 % in the skeletal                    collection and 15% in the pickled collection), the recency of the               majority of the specimens and the superb state of curation make                 the collections at the Field Museum a premier resource for                      evolutionary biologists.  With the changes in the world's                       avifauna (both in distribution and absolute numbers) brought                    about by man's activities and the increasing difficulty in                      obtaining permits for further collecting, the value of the                      Museum's specimens is incalculable.                                                  To protect the collection better and make information about                it more accessible to the scientific community, this project will               start computerization of the collection data.  Computerization                  will improve the staff's ability to answer collection inquiries,                will vastly improve access to collection information for visiting               professionals and other potential users, will allow the staff to                determine what geographic areas and what taxa are poorly                        represented in the collection, and will increase collection                     security by enabling the staff to know at all times where each                  specimen should be located.",
