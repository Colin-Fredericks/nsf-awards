 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Dr. Leo L. Riedinger, University of                      Tennessee, Knoxville, and one of his postdoctoral fellows to                    collaborate with Dr. Jerry D. Garrett, of the Niels Bohr Institute,             Copenhagen, Denmark. They will study high-spin nuclear states in                neutron-deficient platinum nuclei.  The heavy ion accelerator at the            Niels Bohr Institute will be used for the measurements.  Sulfur                 projectiles will initiate the reactions, and the new array of 20                Compton-suppressed Ge counters (the NORDBALL) will be used to                   detect the weak gamma rays from the high-spin states.                                                                                                           The purpose of the proposed experiments is through ion-beam                     spectroscopy to learn about the effect of high-j quasiparticle                  alignment on the soft nuclear shapes in certain light isotopes of               platinum.  A new booster is being added to the accelerator in                   Denmark and will provide particles of appropriate energies.  The                Knoxville and Copenhagen research groups are each active in                     investigating  high-spin angular momentum properties of nuclei                  produced in heavy-ion induced interactions.   Scientists at the                 Niels Bohr Institute are among the world's leaders in research on               high-spin properties of nuclei.   This award will allow the U.S. and            Danish researchers to continue their collaboration and to learn more            about the shape of nuclei as a function of quasiparticle excitation             and rotational frequency.",
