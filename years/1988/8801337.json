 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Prof. J. P. Draayer of Louisiana State                  University in collaboration with Prof. O. Castanos of the                       Universidad Nacional de Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico City, Mexico.  The              objective of the research is to develop a microscopic picture of                collective modes that characterize nuclei.  The researchers intend              to pursue: 1)  the development of a shell-model theory for a                    collective model of potential energy surface phenomenology; 2) a                study of the expansion and contraction mechanisms of Lie algebras               and how they can be used to gain a better understanding of the                  microscopic-macroscopic duality that nuclei display; and 3) the                 development of a many-particle theory of strongly deformed odd-A                nuclei, that is, a shell-model theory that reproduces Nilsson model             phenomenology and perhaps more.                                                                                                                                 The researchers have had a previous history of successful                       collaboration.  This joint effort combines the strengths of the                 Mexican research group in theoretical physics with the LSU                      expertise in the use of group methods in applications to physically             interesting (experimental) phenomena.  The planned research should              help to bolster one to the relatively few groups in the U.S. doing              theoretical low-energy nuclear structure work.",
