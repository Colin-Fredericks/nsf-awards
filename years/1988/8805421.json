 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many eukaryotic protein-encoding genes are interrupted by                       intervening sequences (IVSs) which are excised from mRNA                        precursors (pre-mRNAs) by RNA splicing.  The long-term                          objective of the Investigator's research is to understand how                   pre-mRNA splice sites are correctly recognized and joined in an                 orderly way during RNA splicing.                                                                                                                                In previous work, Dr. Spritz has studied the sequence                           requirements for splice site recognition, the pathways by which                 IVSs are excised from complex pre-mRNAs, alternative pre-mRNA                   splicing, sites by and the structure of U1 small nuclear                        ribonucleoprotein complexes (snRNP) which mediate recognition                   of 5' splice sites.  The P.I. has isolated cDNA and genomic                     clones encoding the hU1-70K protein, a specific component of U1                 snRNP that may be directly involved in 5'splice site                            recognition.   He has already demonstrated that this protein                    binds RNA and have begun to map the RNA-binding sites in the                    protein.    He now proposes to characterize the structure and                   expression of the human gene encoding the hU1-70K snRNP                         protein, to define the sites in the U1-70K protein that mediate                 its interaction with U1 snRNA, pre-mRNA, and other snRNP                        proteins, and it determine how specific substitutions in the                    hU1-70K protein affect 5' splice site recognition by U1 snRNP.                  He also plans to perform similar studies of other U1 snRNP                      proteins.  These studies should thus be of profound importance                  for elucidating the process of 5' splice site recognition by U1                 snRNP.                                                                                                                                                          DNA of living cells codes for cellular proteins via the                         intermediation of RNA.  The RNA that is transcribed from the                    DNA is larger than the functional form that is translated into                  proteins.  The processing of the transcribed form to the                        functional form involves the removal of segments of RNA from                    the interior of the molecule, a process known as splicing.  The                 investigator has identified one of the components of the                        splicing machinery and is study the manner in which it acts.",
