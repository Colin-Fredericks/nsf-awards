 "awd_abstract_narration": "A one year feasibility study is proposed to explore:  (1) the use of            Langmuir-Blodgett technology for production of monolayer and lamellar           films of metal clusters and (2) A cluster based process for producing           high quality diamond films.  These are described as follows:  Research          Plan 1:  The initial objective of the study is to measure surface               versus surface area relationships for gold clusters bound to a variety          of surfactant molecules.  A series of organic molecules consisting of           straight chain alkanes with various functional groups (ethylene,                hydroxyl, amine, and carboxyl) attached at each end are tested as               surfactants.  Once the ability to assemble cluster monolayers at the            air/water interface is established, the transfer of these films to              solid substrates and the structure of the resulting films will be               studied.  Both TEM and STEM are used to explore the uniformity of the           cluster films.  Finally both optical and electrical measurements will           be carried out on the films.  Research Plan 2:  The second project has          the same potential for significant technological and economic impact            as the first but is more uncertain as to its outcome.  The Multiple             Expansion Cluster Source (MECS) concept, which has proven so                    successful in the assembly of nanometer size clusters of metal atoms,           is used for controlled polymerization.  The reaction to be studied is           the formation of polyacetylene molecules suspended as aerosol                   particles in an inert gas carrier.  If this research is successful, it          will provide a method for producing polyacetylene with controlled               molecular weight and a narrow molecular weight distribution.  The               ultimate goal of the project, however, is proof of feasibility of               production of carbon clusters having ideal sp3 or diamond-like bonding          and the deposition these clusters to form high quality films.",
