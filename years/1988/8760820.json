 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I                          project is in the general area of analytical and surface                        chemistry and in the subfield of chromatography.  The goal                      of this research activity is to determine the feasibility                       of developing an ultra-high speed chromatograph with which                      complex samples can be very rapidly analyzed.  To                               accomplish this, open tubular chromatographic columns                           having inside diameters in the range of one to fifty                            micrometers will be examined to determine the optimal                           diameter that will enable preservation of separation                            efficiency while maximizing the speed of analysis.                              Deactivation, coating, and evaluation methods will be                           developed for use with these microbore capillary columns,                       and new sample introduction systems that are compatible                         with them will be developed.  Finally, optimized,                               compatible detectors and associated fast-response                               electronics for use with these ultra-narrow-bore capillary                      columns will be developed and evaluated.                                                                                                                        The successful completion of this Phase I activity should                       demonstrate whether subsequent instrument development would                     lead to a gas chromatograph which would be capable of                           quantifying fifteen-to-twenty sample components per second.                     The availability of such an instrument would impact broadly                     in numerous scientific and technical areas and could, for                       the first time, make gas chromatography the method of                           choice for many applications which require immediate                            analytical data for process and quality control.",
