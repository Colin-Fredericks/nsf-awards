In eight Saturday workshops                    teachers will build and use circuits, electromagnets, and                       transistors. Logo programs will control switches which will in                  turn control the robot each participant will build. Teachers will               attend monthly follow-up meetings and be supported in the                       classroom by the project staff and volunteer scientists.                        Materials produced will include a manual and a videotape which                  document the enhancement.

Through an integrated approach to teaching science and                          technology, participants will increase their understanding of                   various concepts, have more time for teaching, and be able to                   provide students with more in depth instruction.",
