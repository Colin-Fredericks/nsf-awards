 "awd_abstract_narration": "Game theory has become an indispensable tool for research                       activities in many branches of economics in recent years.  In                   applied micro fields especially, where the behavior of the                      individual is often the focus of study, models of                               noncooperative games have become the primary models, most                       particularly when imperfect competition is an important element                 of the situation under study.  The fact is, however, that the                   standard models of noncooperative game theory do not describe                   real-world behavior very well.  The goal of this project is to                  build game models which more accurately describe and predict                    the behavior of real-world participants in economic activities.                 The models developed by this project include:  (1) Evolutionary                 Modelling; (2) Models of Bounded Rationality for Game                           Situations:  and (3) New Models that incorporate observed                       behavior such as a stick-with-winners philosophy associated                     with much trial-and-error or avoidance of situations in which                   unsuccessful outcomes have come about in the past.                                                                                                              In the standard approaches to game-theoretic modelling, players                 are assumed to be completely rational and assumed to assume                     that their fellow players are completely rational.  For applied                 purposes, these assumptions seem dubious, especially given the                  experimental evidence compiled over the years on both one-                      player and many-player games.  This research project aims at                    constructing and developing game-theoretic models in which                      players are not assumed to behave in such completely-rational                   ways, with the goal being more realistic descriptive and                        normative tools for use in applications, especially economic                    applications.                                                                                                                                                   There is already a literature on the subject of modelling games                 with players of incomplete rationality, but the subject seems                   to be resistant to breakthroughs so far.  The research pursues                  several approaches that could lead to breakthroughs.  One is to                 continue the line of research in which strategy selection comes                 about as the result of evolutionary forces acting so as to                      favor those strategies which do relatively well in large                        populations.  Another direction is to continue work on models                   in which players are assumed to act in particular nonoptimal                    ways.  In both of these classes of models, behavior can be                      generated which, in certain examples, is both intuitively                       plausible and qualitatively different from the standard game-                   theoretic solutions prescribed.",
