Research will concentrate on the                          derivation of climatic information from trees at sites located in               North American high latitudes (primarily temperature sensitive)                 and at sites in the eastern United States (primarily moisture                   sensitive).  The main objectives of the research are:  (1) to                   expanded the analyses of the boreal tree-ring series and derived                climatic reconstructions, (2) expand, in a north-south                          direction, the sampling density of trees for this region, (3)                   continue development of X-ray densitometric techniques (4) study                C02/climate/biosphere relations using correlations between tree-                ring indices and normalized differences vegetation index derived                from satellite data, and (5) undertake limited development of                   tree-ring series from South America.  This work will allow                      quantitative reconstruction of the climate system behavior                      through various tree-ring analyses techniques.  The resulting                   data would be the basis against which numerical models of the                   climate system can be calibrated and scientific hypotheses                      regarding climatic changes on decadal-to-century time scales be                 tested.",
