The             Center will be a joint venture with the West Virginia Department of             Highways, West Virginia University, and various private institutions            representing materials and manufactured products.                                                                                                               The center will focus on the transformation of innovative ideas and             techniques into practical application for the nation's existing                 infrastructure.  Efficient and durable structures utilizing                     combinations of conventional, composite, and new materials will be              developed for existing as well as new facilities.  Contemporary                 computer technologies will be integrated with modern transducers to             produce new diagnostic techniques and tools to improve the                      productivity and reliability of inspection and maintenance engineers.           Emphasis will be given to the identification of safety problems                 associated with constructed facilities and to design and analysis               based on expert systems concepts and life-cycle costs.  The final               products of the Center will be ones that can be used directly by                practicing engineers.",
