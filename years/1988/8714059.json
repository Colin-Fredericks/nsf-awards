 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies in medicine, economics and engineering have                      demonstrated that fuzzy set theory may indeed by a useful tool for              the expression of professional judgement.  Studies in structural                engineering have been on damage assessment due to fatigue, and                  seismic loads.  This research will emphasize the reliability and                safety of existing (including newly constructed) plane frame                    structures.  Classical reliability analysis will be used first to               calculate the structure's reliability measure using objective                   information such as yield strength of materials, geometry of                    structures and applied loads.  The reliability measure will then be             updated utilizing the fuzzy set logic to include the quality of                 connections and structural members through inspections.  Other                  parameters pertinent to the overall safety of a structure will also             be investigated.  An algorithm for updating the objective reliability           will be presented.  The significance of incorporating the subjective            information in reliability analyses will be discussed.  The results             of this proposed study are expected to provide a more precise                   assessment on the safety of structures.  These results are expected             to enhance the engineers or owners' decision-making process in                  determining appropriate action to the structure such as maintenance,            and rehabilitation, etc.",
