 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is in support of a workshop to examine the application               of scientific drilling to the solution of a wide array of earth                 science problems in the Antarctic.  In the Antarctic, where 98                  percent of the continent is encased in ice, the application of                  advanced technologies, such as drilling for stratigraphic,                      geophysical and glaciological objectives, will be an important                  addition to U.S. research capabilities.  This effort is in                      response to recommendations by the National Academy of Sciences                 (\"Antarctic Solid-Earth Sciences Research, A Guide for the Next                 Decade and Beyond,\" 1987).  The workshop is planned for the spring              of 1988 in Columbus, Ohio, and will bring together experts in all               phases of ice/rock drilling for scientific objectives.                                                                                                          The meeting is an important aspect of the Antarctic geoscience                  research program and will point to new directions for future                    research in this area.",
