The method of hydrodynamic isolation to protect concrete dams                   against earthquakes is studied.  A dam is isolated, not from the                ground motions, but from the dynamic water pressure by means of                 either anchoring gas-filled balloons in the reservoir, attaching a              closed-cell foam material to the upstream face, or continuously                 injecting bubbles into the reservoir.  Thus, the significant increase           in response of the dam which may occur when the reservoir is full               or nearly full is eliminated.  All three schemes will be evaluated for          potential benefit as well as cost.                                                                                                                              It has been shown that a strong earthquake represents a severe                  loading of a large concrete dam with full or nearly full reservoir,             causing extensive cracking with unknown consequences.  Isolating a              concrete dam from hydrodynamic effects avoids the increase in                   dynamic response.  This increase becomes significant as the water               level is raised from about the three-quarter height of the dam to               the crest.                                                                                                                                                      The study has potential to impact retrofit of existing dams with seismic        deficiencies and the design of new dams.",
