 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an investigation of how to fix the major problem with object-           oriented programming languages:  efficiency.  A polymorphic type system         will be used information that the compiler will need to perform code            optimization.  The type system and the optimization are both                    antithetical to the interactive, incremental programming style                  supported so well by object-oriented programming, so that type-safe             debugging and incremental compilation in the presence of global code            optimization must be investigated.                                                                                                                              Interest is mostly in language implementation issues rather in language         design issues, the work is based on Smalltalk-80 with intention, to             reuse as much of the class library and programming environment as               possible.  By reusing an existing language, instead of inventing a new          one, the problems we solve will be ones shared by many object-oriented          languages, and thus the solutions will be generally applicable.^R               JUSTIFICATION",
