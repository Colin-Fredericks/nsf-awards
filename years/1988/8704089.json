The                     instrument will be located in the mass spectrometer center, an                  analytical and bioanalytical resource that provides state-of-the-               art capability in mass spectrometry.  Specifically, the                         instrument will provide:  exact mass measurements to provide                    elemental composition for unknown organic compounds, high- mass-                range scanning at low resolution for use with newly developed                   soft ionization methods, and linked scans for the analysis of                   metastable, daughter, and granddaughter ions and neutral                        transitions as an aid to structure elucidation using MS/MS.  The                users are involved in research on allelochemicals and humic                     substances from soil, synthetic and mechanistic organic                         chemistry, composition of fossil fuels and naphthenic acids,                    proton affinity, biosynthesis of phytoalexins, oligo- and                       polysaccharide recognition process, protein identification and                  gene cloning, structures of polymer networks, metabolism and                    identification of retinoids, hydroprocessing of liquid fuels,                   elucidating fungal toxins, and electron transport chain and                     ubiquinones.  The instrument will also be used by the surrounding               community of mass spectrometrists.",
