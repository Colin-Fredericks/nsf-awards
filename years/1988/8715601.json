 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shallow foundations are often used to support equipment that is                 sensitive to ground vibrations.  If ground vibrations are severe,               problems develop even in the absence of                                         people object to building vibrations.  In such cases, efforts are               made to isolate the structure from the ground movements, or, at                 least, to reduce the amplitude of the vibrations.  A technique that             is often used is to provide an open trench around the structure but             such an approach is likely to be expensive, particularly for deep               trenches, and may be ineffective unless placed at the right location.           A few experimental studies have shown that the problem is a difficult           one.  Theoretical studies using two- or three-dimensional finite                element analyses are very expensive even for research purposes, and             are unlikely to find much use for practical engineering work.  In               their proposal, the PI's                                                        on a relatively                                                                 element method.\"  If successful, the research should lead to an                 economical theoretical approach to the problem and allow for                    realistic analyses of this group of problems.",
