 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR project will study the effects on layer interface abruptness          of OMCVD reactor design.  Three different verticle reactor                      configurations will be investigated:  the pancake-shaped susceptor,             the barrel-shaped susceptor, and the dual susceptor.  Although all              three configurations are vertical reactors, the gas dynamics and                thermal profiles in all three are different.  These differences are             expected to lead to vastly difference surface conditions and interface          formation.  This study will focus on the generation of a data base and          understanding of III-V heterostructures and interfaces, especially in           the GaAs/AlGaAs system.  A preliminary model to describe interface              formation for the different reactors of interest will be developed.             The completion of Phase 1 will identify growth experiments that need            to be carried out in order to verify the model.  Phase 2 will involve           growth and characterization of heterostructures to feedback into the            model, and to allow prediction of interface formation.  The combined            phases 1 and 2 work should lead to a understanding of the fundamental           mechanisms involved in interface formation in OMCVD.  Such                      understanding will be necessary for the design and fabrication of the           next generation of III-V devices.",
