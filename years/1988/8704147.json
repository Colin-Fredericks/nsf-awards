 "awd_abstract_narration": "The machining of sculptured surfaces with Numerical Control                (NC) is a common practice in many industries.  Sculptured surfaces              arise in the design of car bodies, ship hulls, aircraft, and other              applications.  The problem that the principal investigators want to             solve is: given a mathematically defined sculptured surface and a               set of NC tool movements, does the shape cut by the tool match the              mathematical shape within a given tolerance?                                         Previously, the principal investigators have developed                     algorithms and data structures for rapidly simulating the actions of            a three-axis mill on a carefully chosen sample of points on the                 surface.  This method can guarantee tolerances at every point on the            surface both for areas where excess material remains and for areas              that have been gouged.                                                               The concept of surface discretization is a new one and poses a             series of research questions which the principal investigators                  intend to address:  1) Can the simulation method, currently limited             to three-axis NC machining, be extended to five-axis NC machining               without marked decrease in efficiency?  2) Would a discretization of            the surface into a triangle-based boundary representation be more               efficient or reliable than the current point-based method?  3) Can              the error information generated by the simulation be used to make               corrections to the NC program and could the discretized surface be              used as a basis for algorithms to generate NC tool paths?  4) What              is the trade-off between the spacing between points and the accuracy            of the method?  and 5) Can the simulation speed be improved through             parallel algorithms?",
