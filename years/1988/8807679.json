 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Engineering Research Equipment Grant will support purchase of              equipment capable of producing narrow linewidth (< 100 MHz) or short            temporal width dye laser pulses.  Specially, a pulsed dye amplifier             (PDA) is sought which would enable a variety of spectroscopic                   experiments involving diatomic molecules that are attractive                    candidates for new VUV, UV or visible lasers.  Also an existing CW dye          laser will be upgraded to narrow linewidth, scanning operation.  Both           of these items of equipment will be coupled with existing pump lasers           (excimer for the PDA, AR+ ion for the CW dye) to examine the structure          via spectroscopy of: (1) rare gas dimers (for a potential anti-Stokes           Raman laser in the VUV); (2) rare gas oxides; and (3) lead monoiodide.          Furthermore, experiments designed to explore the pulsed amplication of          quantum well semiconductor lasers will be conducted.  This equipment            will improve the ability to investigate the details of the structure            and chemical behavior of potential new laser molecules and develop new          sources of tunable radiation in the VUV to visible, as well as expand           the scope of other on-going research.",
