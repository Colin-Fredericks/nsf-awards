 "awd_abstract_narration": "The eukaryotic ultraplankton (1-6 + um) is at times the most            signigicant component of the photosynthetic plankton, both in                   terms of biomass and primary productivity, especially in the deep               chlorophyll maximum (ca. 100 m depth).  The species comprising it               have been studied very little for two reasons; besides their                    small size, their fragility makes most preserve poorly for                      routine observation, and their sensitivity has until recently                   made isolation into culture exceedingly difficult.  Our                         ultraplankton collection now contains some 200 clones in unialgal               or axenic culture.  With collaborators we are studying (1)                      morphology and ultrastructure by light microscopy, SEM and TEM,                 and (2) photosynthetic pigment suites by HPLC and techniques of                 carotenoid chemistry.  The results will assist in placing the                   organisms taxonomically and undoubtedly will result in new taxa,                new taxonomic criteria, and possibly major revision of some                     higher systematic levels.  We also study nutrition of the clones                in culture.  Some have heterotrophic or phagotrophic                            capabilities.  Requirements for trace elements - Fe, Mn, Zn, Se -               will be compared to the requirements of known oceanic and neritic               phytoplankton species by growth studies under defined conditions.               These studies, together with those being carried out by other                   groups on photosynthetic behavior, other physiological                          properties, grazing, etc. will give us much better understanding                of the ecology of this important flora, now available for study.",
