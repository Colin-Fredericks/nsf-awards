 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the principal goals of basic research in atmospheric                science is to improve our ability to predict weather and                        climate.  This requires not only a thorough understanding of                    atmospheric dynamical and physical processes, but also finding                  the proper means of representing these processes in                             sophisticated numerical models.  Clear progress has been made                   in this field in the last decade and the principal investigator                 has been responsible for many important advances.  Nevertheless,                we have not begun to approach the theoretical limit of useful                   atmospheric prediction.                                                              This award provides support for basic research aimed at                    improving numerical weather prediction, with particular                         emphasis on the tropics.  The research involves a number of                     related studies, most of which employ a state-of-the-art,                       multilevel global spectral model developed by Dr. Krishnamurti                  and his colleagues.  Among the many important topics that will                  be investigated are model initialization with emphasis on                       humidity distribution;  parameterization of cumulus convection;                 the impact of increased model resolution;  representation of                    cloud processes, particularly radiation;  systematic errors                     related to representation of momentum flux in the models; and                   maintenance of vertical consistency in the various physical                     parameterizations.                                                                   The emphasis in this research is on the tropics, but the                   results have direct and important implications for improving                    medium range numerical weather prediction for the midlatitudes                  because, on this timescale, weather in one part of the globe                    influences weather in other regions.  One of the most serious                   shortcomings in global models today is the poor representation                  of the tropical regions.  This research should improve both our                 fundamental understanding of the tropical atmosphere and its                    representation in numerical models.",
