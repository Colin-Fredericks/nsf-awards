 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research suggests a new model of decision under                         uncertainty in a multi-period framework where the decision maker                (an individual or an organization) is assumed to be boundedly                   rational.  The model differs from existing ones in two key                      assumptions: (1) the process is assumed to have an infinite                     history, i.e., to be in a \"steady state,\" and (2\u00d5) the bounded                  rationality notion is modeled by a new computational model--a                   Turing machine with memory.  The research objectives are: to                    define formally a Turing machine with memory; to study the various              models of machines with memory, compare their computational                     ability and analyze the trade-offs among their complexity, size of              memory and length of recall; to study the effects of interaction,               assuming more than one decision maker is involved, and; to                      generalize the model in order to allow for the appearance and                   disappearance of decision makers (or agents) in the context of                  cooperative and competitive models.",
