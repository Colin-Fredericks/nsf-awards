 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal on \"Ecological Engineering:  Theory and Development in            the U.S. and China\" between Dr. William Mitsch and Dr. David L.                 Johnson of the Ohio State University Research Foundation and                    Professors Ma Shijun, Yan Jingsong, and Li Dianmo of the Institute              of Zoology of the Academia Sinica, is jointly sponsored by NSF and              the Chinese Academy of Sciences.                                                                                                                                This cooperative program will explore and define the concept of                 ecological engineering. \"Ecological engineering\" and \"ecotechnology\"            are terms used to indicate the design of human society with its                 natural environment for the benefit of both.  The general approaches            to ecological engineering are somewhat different in the U.S. and in             China, although the overall concepts are the same.  Chinese and                 American researchers will collaborate to identify underlying                    concepts and theories (principles) of ecological engineering,                   including concepts such as self design, multi layering, and                     resiliency and restoration, and maximum power.                                                                                                                  Using mathematical models of six research sites in both the U.S. and            China, the investigators will attempt preliminary verification of               some of these principles.",
