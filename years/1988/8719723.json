 "awd_abstract_narration": "Heuristic appraisal (HA) is the evaluation of the promise and                   expected fertility of a theory, research program, proposal,                     instrument, or technique, its ability to handle difficulties                    blocking progress and to generate interesting new questions for                 research. HA is critical to understanding the behavior of                       scientific researchers at all stages of research, from initial                  problem-finding to the post-acceptance assessment of a theory as                a basis for further research.  To working scientists the future                 prospects of a theory under consideration as a locus of research-               -its problem-solving potential--is often more important than its                track record of empirical success.  HA informs funding decisions                and, in a larger context, technology assessment, public-policy                  decisions, and future studies.  HA is fundamental to the \"economy               of research\" in all senses of that phrase and hence should be a                 central topic for methodologies of science, engineering, and                    technology.  Yet philosophers of science have largely ignored                   the topic.  How are heuristic assessments made?  What are the                   dimensions and criteria of assessment?  How might these differ                  in weight at different stages of research? How does HA relate to                epistemic appraisal?  Dr. Nickles' project will address these                   questions, answer philosophical objections to a full-scale study                of HA, critique the few extant treatments, and locate and                       explore sources of documentary evidence of HA within working                    science (e.g., recent research proposals and peer commentaries).                This study promises to be of great value both for philosophy of                 science and for science policy.",
