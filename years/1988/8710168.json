 "awd_abstract_narration": "The distribution of proxy nutrient-like tracers such as                    13C and Cd provides information on past deep ocean circulation                  patterns and the processes controlling atmospheric C02.  These                  tracers are particularly valuable when they are measured in the                 same samples.  It is now certain that the water mass structure                  of the North Atlantic Ocean was very different during glacial                   times:  the present vertically-homogeneous North Atlantic                       nutrient structure changed into one in which deep waters had                    higher nutrient levels and shallow waters had lower nutrient                    levels.  Drs. Boyle and Keigwin propose to determine the most                   recent glacial maximum hydrography of the Atlantic in detail,                   and to do several long time series over the last 300, 000 years                 that will provide evidence on the response of deep ocean                        circulation to Milankovitch orbital forcing.  We also propose                   to examine the 13C and Cd content of high-latitude planktonic                   foraminifera as a guide to the nutrient content of polar                        oceans.  Polar nutrients play heavily in some models of why                     glacial atmospheric C02 was lower than at present, and it is                    vital that it be shown how they might have changes over time.                   The P.I.'s also propose to develop barium as a new                              paleoceanographic tracer.  Barium is more silica-like in its                    distribution in the open ocean, so it provides more useful                      information on past variations in Pacific hydrography than                      do 13C and Cd.  Because barium is enriched in the Mediterranean                 Sea, paleo-barium studies will allow for a better evaluation of                 the relative roles of North Atlantic Intermediate Water and                     Mediterranean Outflow in determining the intermediate depth                     nutrient depletions observed in the North Atlantic Ocean.  The                  P.I.s also propose to continue systematic evaluation of the                     reliability of benthic foraminifera as paleochemical tracers.",
