 "awd_abstract_narration": "On October 1, 1987 the Whittier Narrows Earthquake struck                       approximately 10 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, California.  This          very well instrumented region includes thousands of tilt-up buildings           of varying ages which experienced strong motions and in some cases,             significant  amounts of damage.  Starting the day of the earthquake             perishable performance data on approximately 120 tilt-up structures             were collected throughout the area.                                                                                                                             This research project collates the performance data and conducts                statistical analyses of it.  Detailed performance and structural data           are collected for the more seriously damaged structures.  Special               attention is paid to the relative performance of pre- and post-San              Fernando Earthquake structures in order to evaluate seismic code                provisions intended to eliminate deficiencies identified in the 1971            event.  The documentation of these data will prove invaluable in                highlighting serious design and construction problems common to these           buildings and in improving the accuracy of future damage estimates.             This is desirable because the construction type is very popular for             low-rise commercial and industrial buildings and houses many strategic          industries.",
