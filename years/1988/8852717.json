Six experiments are             being introduced into general chemistry involving computers interfaced          with sensors for the gathering of experimental data.  Temperature               probes, colorimeter interfaces or pH meter interfaces designed by               project SERAPHIM staff are being used.  Lotus 1-2-3 and Lotus Measure           are serving as templates at the introductory level.  Experiments                include chemical kinetics; calorimetry and heat of reaction; molecular          weight from freezing point depression; computer driven titration to             measure equilibrium; gas chromatography; and statistics and error               analysis.  In physical chemistry the students are doing advanced                aspects of some of these same experiments as well as using the                  computers for analysis atomic and molecular orbitals through display of         wave functions and the consideration of changes in bond length.
