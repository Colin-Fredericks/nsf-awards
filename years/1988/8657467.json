The interstellar medium work will be               directed toward understanding how magnetic fields affect the                    emission which is observed in shocked regions.  Modelling of the                structure of globular clusters will be done to better understand                the formation and evolution of such star agglomerations.                                                                                                        Much of our knowledge of the interstellar medium comes from                     observations of the radiation emitted by energetic gas flows as                 they interact with quiescent molecular material.  Dr. Chernoff                  concentrates his research on the question of the influence and                  importance of magnetic fields on the emission which is observed.                The predominant thrust of theoretical research on globular                      clusters in the past two decades has been to isolate the clusters               from their surroundings and focus on their internal processes.                  Dr. Chernoff is interested in establishing the connection between               internal structure and evolution of clusters with external                      factors.",
