 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an Accomplishment-Based Renewal grant to continue research              on the planetary boundary layer in East Antarctica.  The region                 under study is quite large and generates extremely variable, and                sometimes very strong winds.                                                                                                                                    The main tools of the study are a chain of automatic weather                    stations stretching over 1,000 km from the coast to Dome C and                  another chain along the Adelie Coast.  There are also several                   instrumented towers.  In addition satellite microwave images will               be used to study areas of the sea near the coast that are keep ice              free by the katabatic winds.  Increased effort will be put into                 attempting to model the gravity driven windfield to try to better               understand the source of the great variability.                                                                                                                 This is a part of a much larger collaboration between the French                and Australian Antarctic Programs and USARP.                                                                                                                    This grant also provides for the support of an undergraduate                    student under the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)                 Program.",
