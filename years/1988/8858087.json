He was the         co-designer and implementor of ITOSS, the Integrated toolkit for                Operating System Security, and has designed and implemented a number of         new security techniques and algorithms.                                                                                                                         He is currently developing techniques for realizing \"self-securing              programs\", programs which are able to run securely and efficiently in           environments which provide only minimal security support.  He is                conducting the following research:                                                                                                                              -To develop a family of randomized algorithms sufficient for                    implementing      self-securing programs.                                       -To build a library of software routines which allow software engineers         to     transparently implement self-securing support for their                  application programs. -To demonstrate the utility of these ideas by             implementing them cleanly on the   Camelot transaction processing               system running under the Mach operating        system.                          -To document, test, and distribute the code developed as a result of            this      implementation.                                                                                                                                       He is also interested in visual programming of security constraints and         in the inventing of algorithmic techniques for detecting security flaws         in running operating systems.",
