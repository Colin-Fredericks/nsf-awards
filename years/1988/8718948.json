Twenty-five leading scholars in this research                        tradition will gather to assess what has been accomplished, to                  evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of varying research                       traditions, to develop agendas for furthering the comparative                   study of culture, and to resolve disagreements among comparative                researchers by involving researchers with different viewpoints in               collaborative papers.  The conference will produce a summary of                 the proceedings in a major journal, and a book-length manuscript                consisting of the conference papers.                                                                                                                            This research is important because the explanation of the                       similarities and differences in human society and culture is                    critical to our understanding of ourselves as human beings.  This               conference should produce an evaluation of the state-of-the-art                 in this research tradition, with prescriptions for future                       directions for research.  The Human Relations Area Files is the                 leading repository of cross-cultural research materials, and is                 the appropriate organization to host and organize the conference.",
