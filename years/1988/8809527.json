 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most important factors in determining an individual's                reaction to a stressful event is the expectation about that                     event:  Does the individual have control over the stressor, or                  does he not?  When humans or animals are exposed to stressful                   events over which they have no control, they experience a number                of behavioral and physiological disturbances which do not occur                 if they DO have control, even if the stressors are physically                   identical.  Such disturbances, and the theoretical entities                     thought to produce them, are widely believed to be important (and               alterable) causes of depression, anxiety, urban stress, etc.  It                is therefore important to understand the mechanisms by which the                controllability vs. uncontrollability of stressors alters both                  behavior and physiological functioning.                                                                                                                         Using a variety of experimental approaches, Dr. Maier has already               produced an extensive behavioral groundwork for the current                     studies.  He is now pursuing several major lines of research, all               directed at answering this fundamental question:  What determines               the expectation of controllability, and its attendant                           consequences?  Dr. Maier is carrying out four related sets of                   studies:  1)  The role of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine in                controllability; 2)  the relationship between stressor                          controllability and spinal cord processes that regulate pain                    perception; 3)  the role of stressor controllability in altering                daily activity patterns, and the sensitivity of these activity                  patterns to pharmacological manipulation (e.g., with                            antidepressants); and 4)  the nature of the cognitive changes                   produced by stressors, and the role of fear and anxiety in                      mediating these cognitive changes.                                                                                                                              Recent research by Dr. Maier and others has made it clear that                  the stress response is not simply the result of exposure to a                   particular physical stimulus or condition, but rather is the                    result of a complex interaction between the event itself and the                organism's expectations, about that event.  The results of the                  current studies will broaden our understanding of the role of                   \"stressor controllability\" in the development of \"coping\"                       behaviors, and in the ability of stressed individuals to adapt to               their environment.",
