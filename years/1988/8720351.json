 "awd_abstract_narration": "The acquisition of an analytical electron microscope facility                 is proposed.  The availability of this equipment would greatly                  improve the quality and extend the scope of several ongoing and                 proposed materials research projects at the University of Alabama               at Birmingham.  Many of these projects are sponsored by the NSF.                The proposed equipment would have very high spatial resolution                  limits for both microstructural observations and microarea X-ray                and diffraction analysis.  The instrumentation will be interfaced               with a recently acquired X-ray microanalysis system and an image                analyzing system.  This will complement our analysis capabilities               that are available with our capabilities to include ceramic and                 semiconductor materials.                                                          The research projects that would be enhanced by the purchase of               the proposed instrumentation include the following studies:                     grain boundary nucleation and growth of carbide and laves phases                in high nickel alloys, the origin of deformation controlled grain               size distribution width, particle coarsening, characterization of               II-VI semiconductors for infrared detectors, processing and                     characterization of high temperature superconducting materials,                 new materials for high-speed microelectronic packaging                          applications, characterization of thin ceramic coatings on metal                substrates, structure analysis of hydroxyapatite bone filler                    material, heavy metal ion attachment for antimicrobial effect,                  field ion microscope/atom probe analysis of niobium and carbon                  segregation to grain boundaries in nickel-based alloys, defects                 in alkaline earth oxides, processing and properties of metals,                  identification of defects in crystals formed during growth, the                 relationship of physical and magnetic properties of sputtered                   cobalt-chromium thin films to corrosion behavior, and tissue                    ingrowth into polymer fabric implants.",
