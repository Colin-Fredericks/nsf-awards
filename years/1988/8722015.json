 "awd_abstract_narration": "The pristine conditions and the often simplified biotic communities of          the Arctic offer unique opportunities to study aquatic processes and            biological interactions.  Arctic freshwaters need to be studied not             only because of the opportunity to determine fundamental relationships          but also to supply information to managers and governing groups so that         plans can be made for the best possible use of aquatic resources.  Nine         investigators will measure changes in the ecology of rivers and lakes in        Arctic Alaska caused by experimental manipulations of nutrients and fish        populations.  The integrating concepts are that changes of rate of              nutrient supply at the bottom of the food change and of fish populations        at the top of the food chain have direct effects on algal and fish              populations, and indirect effects up and down the food chain.                   Experiments manipulating nutrient and fish concentrations will be               conducted using whole and divided lakes, large enclosures, and whole            streams.  Results will provide a better understanding of how rivers and         lakes are regulated and will enable better predictions of how the               resources of Arctic lakes and rivers will respond to human disturbances.",
