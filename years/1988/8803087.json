 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves a theory for making a sequence of                   selections from a number of stochastic processes.  The selection                made at each stage can depend on information regarding the                      various processes that has accummulated to that stage; that is,                 the decision problem is sequential.  The project deals with four                specific problems:  (1)  Finding the strategies that behave well                over a large class of discount sequences and prior distributions,               (2)  Allocating experiments to groups of experimental units in                  stages, (3)  Maximizing the probability of a particular number of               successes, and (4)  Allocating to one of two independent                        processes or to a third process that is the simultaneous                        application of the two independent processes.                                        This research is in the general area of statistical decision               theory.  It has relevance to a variety of other scientific fields               including economics, psychology, medicine, and engineering.",
