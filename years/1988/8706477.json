 "awd_abstract_narration": "The North Plant Documentation Center is the name given to                  the computerized database and ancillary functions at the                        Herbarium of the University of Alaska Museum.  It is the sum of                 all activities and products derived from computerized label data                of the specimens at the Herbarium.  As the largest collection of                Alaskan vascular plants and the second largest for bryophytes and               lichens, it is an important resource to the field of systematics.               The user community is much larger, for primary data on plants and               their distributions are fundamental to land-planning,                           environmental monitoring, and botanical research in general.  The               center provides a single source for information that is fully                   documented by specimens.  There is no other institution with both               the specimens and the singular commitment to the flora of Alaska.                    This project will support completion of the retrospective                  data banking of the Center's holdings.  With the entire flora                   well represented, the Center will be able to provide a large                    amount of vital data to a varied clientele.  From its database it               will be able to provide excerpts or full records of its holdings                in support of detailed monographs, synoptic floras, biotic                      inventories, environmental assessments, and studies of rare                     plants.  The completed database will be queried by others to plan               loans and field research.",
