 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vegetation responses to naturally- and culturally-induced                  disturbances in the environment may be expressed                                phytogeographically or morphologically, and previous studies have               documented the detection of such changes in satellite data.                     Current image processing techniques limit our ability to detect                 the changes in areas having complex vegetation patterns or                      shadowing caused by high topographic relief.  This study will                   evaluate several models for interpretation of mixed-pixels and                  shadowed data and develop processing techniques to enable us to                 extract the maximum spectral information from vegetation.  Two                  study areas, one having high topographic relief in the northern                 Rocky Mountains and one having a mosaic of vegetation communities               in the humid eastern U.S., will be used for testing and                         verification of results.  Satellite data sets to be used include                Landsat Thematic Mapper and French SPOT data.  Such technology                  will be of use to workers in many fields, including geology and                 mineral exploration, rangeland improvement, desertification                     studies, agriculture, and forestry.                                                  Teaching and counseling activities will complement the                     research.  Two formal courses will be offered, as well as                       individual counseling of students who express interest in a                     geobotanical project.  Of importance to both home and host                      institutions is the exchange of information and ideas with                      faculty and research staff which will result in expanded skill                  and knowledge of all participants.  Considering the very small                  percentage of women in geosciences, Dr. Milton's presence will be               a strong statement to women considering careers in geology or                   mining engineering.                                                                  This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1)                 to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                  engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF                  and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and                     engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists                and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic                    institutions.  By encouraging the participation of women in                     science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future                     scientific vitality.",
