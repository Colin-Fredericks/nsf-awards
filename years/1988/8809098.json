 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1974, the Commission of the European Communities launched the                Euro-Barometer surveys, a survey research program designed to                   provide regular monitoring of the social and political attitudes                of representative national samples of the public of the nine-                   member nations, France, West Germany, Great Britain, Italy, The                 Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg.  The                     number of countries surveyed increased to ten in October, 1980,                 with the entry of Greece; and the number increased to twelve,                   with the addition of Spain and Portugal in October, 1985.                       Carried out in the Spring and Fall of each year, a total of 28                  Euro-Barometer surveys had been completed by the end of 1987.  In               addition to obtaining regular readings on support for European                  integration, national goals and political issues, political party               preferences, ideological orientations and subjective well-being,                given Euro-Barometers have explored a variety of special topics                 such as attitudes toward poverty and unemployment, gender roles,                interpersonal trust, energy and environmental problems, attitudes               toward work and attitudes toward science and technology.                        The Commission of the European Communities sponsors these surveys               in order to obtain feedback about the current state of public                   opinion in the member countries; it does not finance social                     science research per se.  Accordingly, the Commission provides no               funds for cleaning or archiving the data.  Immediately after                    fieldwork, a set of tabulations is run to provide the basis for a               twice-yearly report to the Commission.  The data are then turned                over to this project's principal investigator in a condition that               the average user would find difficult to utilize.  The data have                not been cleaned, and their coding and format vary from country                 to country and from one survey to the next.  Moreover, there is                 no codebook and little documentation of any kind beyond the                     questionnaires in the various languages used in the respective                  countries.                                                                      This project makes available to social scientists the body of                   cross-national surveys carried out each Spring and Fall in each                 of the 12 European Community countries.  The principal                          investigator will acquire the data, clean them, recode them in                  cross-nationally standardized form, prepare machine-readable                    codebooks for each survey and distribute them through the Inter-                university Consortium for Political and Social Research survey                  data archive at the University of Michigan. One indicator of the                value these data have for the social science community is the                   widespread demand for the surveys that have been released to                    date.  The European Community surveys have become the third most                widely-requested datasets handled by the Consortium, ranking                    immediately after the National Election Studies and the National                Opinion Research Center General Social Surveys.  In the field of                Comparative Politics, nothing approaches their level of use.  The               datasets have been furnished to well over 200 different                         institutions, several of which are foreign survey data archives                 that service entire nations.  The data are utilized in scores of                publications each year, in the fields of political science,                     social psychology, sociology and economics.",
