 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to develop a general analytical                  framework that can be used to determine the technological conditions            under which firms in an industry operate, as well as to answer                  questions dealing with market structure, pricing behavior, and the              exercise of market power.  The analytical framework can be used to              analyze multiproduct firms operating in competitive, monopolistic, or           oligopolistic market structures.  Applications of this framework will           involve rail roads and the auto industry, which respectively represent          monopolistic and oligopolistic industries.  The empirical research on           rail roads will focus on the technological structure of the industry            and its pricing and market behavior in a regulated and quasi regulated          environment, while the empirical research on the auto industry will             analyze the pricing behavior of individual firms, the extent to which           they take into account demand interdependence, and their technological          structure.  This research is important because it will provide a better         understanding of technological change in industries exercising                  significant market power.",
