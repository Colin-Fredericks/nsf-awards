 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is an experimental and computational investigation of             the thermo-fluid processes associated with fusion welding.  The effort          is divided into three smaller, clearly focused investigations.  The             first of these is an experimental simulation of fusion welding,                 employing a low melting point eutectic.  Detailed temperature                   measurements and surface fluid flow visualizations will be carried out          to study the multidimensional, transient transport processes involving          phase change.  This study will provide a starting point for the                 subsequent temperature measurements in the gas tungsten arc (GTA)               welding process.  Thermal histories at various locations during GTA             welding will be measured for lead, aluminum and steels.  To complement          the two experimental studies, computations of heat transfer and fluid           flow during fusion welding will also be performed.                                                                                                              There are two primary goals of this research.  First, a fundamental             understanding of the heat transfer and fluid flow processes associated          with fusion welding is sought.  A number of complex features such as            multidimensional convection and conduction transport, change of phase,          surface tension and multiple of physical mechanisms which have not              previously been considered together in detail.  These studies will              also provide guidelines to the welding engineer to correlate the                thermo-fluid processes with the post weld mechanical properties.  In            addition, the possibility of providing real time corrective action              during welding, using heat and fluid flow measurements will be                  examined.  This will permit real time control of automated welding              operations to improve weld quality.",
