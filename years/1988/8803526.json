 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research will continue studies that seek to establish an                    integrated biostratigraphic standard of reference for Lower                     Devonian faunas of western North America Cordillera based on                    quantitative studies of variation within conodont and graptolite                lineages and will add ostracode faunas to the synthesis.  An                    integrated and detailed standard of reference is necessary to an                understanding of paleobiological problems of biogeography,                      biofacies and patterns of evolution.  It is also required to solve              stratigraphic and structural problems requiring a high degree of                resolution.  Such studies are rare in the literature because the                concurrence of the factors necessary for success is rarely                      encountered.  Previous quantitative studies of the lower Lower                  Devonian in central Nevada have demonstrated the utility of                     conducting statistical studies of conodont lineages for this                    purpose.  By-products of these studies indicate that a number of                additional important Lower Devonian conodont lineages are present               entirely or in part in several known sections or extensions of                  them.  These sections are located in the Toquima Range, the                     Simpson Park Range, the Monitor Range and the Roberts Mountains                 and have formed the primary data base for what is presently known               of conodont and graptolite biostratigraphy of this part of the                  column in the region.                                                                                                                                           Study of several lineages has shown the enhancement of correlation              that can be attained and the utility of such studies in attaining               a stable classification.  Both are ingredients necessary to a                   detailed and stable biostratigraphic standard of reference.",
