 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research in Undergraduate Instittuions (RUI) award is to              continue and complete research on simulation methodologies for                  real-time surgical training in collaboration with the NSF                       sponsored Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for                   Interactive Computer Graphics at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.              The research will address constructing theoretical and                          experimental models which will focus on the design and validation               of a simulation model for the human knee joint with special                     attention paid to modeling the meniscus.  Knee geometry will be                 reconstructed from NMR scans of an actual human knee.  Soft                     tissues will be modeled using a new particle-based computer-                    simulation modeling technique that is particularly well suited to               real-time modeling of soft biological tissues.  These models will               be utilized for the teaching of arthoscopic surgical techniques.                     The Principal Investigator is well qualified to conduct this               research.                                                                            The Program Manager recommends Williams College be awarded                 $30,000 for one (1) year.  The award includes $5,000 to provide                 support for one undergraduate research assistant from the                       \"Funding for Support of Women, Minority, and Disabled Engineering               Research Assistants\" program.",
