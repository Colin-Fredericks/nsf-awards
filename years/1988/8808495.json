 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stimulation of the skin results in muscle activity that causes a                withdrawal of the limb away from the point of stimulation, a                    \"protective\" reflex.  This response to gentle skin stimulation is               a very widely studied model system used to investigate neuronal                 plasticity.  This plasticity, a change in activity resulting from               experience, is believed to underlie some of the simplest forms of               learning.  By using a combination of neuroanatomical and                        neurophysiological techniques, Dr. Durkovic and his colleagues                  are constructing a detailed map of the neurons (nerve cells)                    which mediate this modifiable protective reflex.                                                                                                                Dr. Durkovic's previous studies have shown that this reflex can                 be produced by neurons located entirely within the spinal cord.                 In the present set of experiments, he first deposits fluorescent                dyes in the output regions (motoneuron pools) of the spinal cord.               These dyes undergo retrograde neuronal transport--they are                      carried backwards into the cell bodies of neurons that send axons               toward the motoneuron pools.  These neurons are then identified                 by using a special fluorescence microscope, and the stained cells               are then mapped within specific spinal cord regions.                                                                                                            Dr. Durkovic is also stimulating the motoneuron pool itself, to                 excite the cells that project into these regions.  He records                   from the cell bodies of the activated neurons, and then localizes               the recording site(s) within the spinal cord.  The electrical                   activity of these neurons and muscles are monitored to see if                   they are related to each other.  Those neurons activated by skin                stimulation, and whose activity is related to muscle activity,                  are thus identified as being part of the neural circuit of the                  protective reflex.                                                                                                                                              This work will help to identify the characteristics of the neural               pathways involved in protective reflexes.  It will also identify                components of the neural circuitry directly involved in the                     production of reflex modifications analogous to classically                     conditioned responses.",
