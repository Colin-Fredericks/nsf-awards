 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support ongoing collaboration between U.S. and                  Swedish physicists on the topic of high energy heavy ion                        interactions.  Drs. R. Jeffrey Wilkes, Thompson H. Burnett and                  Jeri J. Lord of the University of Washington will continue                      their research efforts with Dr. K.N. Ingvar Otterlund and his                   laboratory group at the University of Lund.  Experiments will                   be performed at the CERN heavy ion facility in Geneva,                          Switzerland, and Brookhaven National Laboratory in the United                   States, and the analysis and reduction of the data will be                      conducted at the respective individual universities.  The                       heavy ions Si-28 and S-32 will be accelerated to energies of                    15-200 GeV/nucleon and then directed onto emulsion chamber                      detectors, which are arrays of nuclear emulsion plates                          permitting extremely precise observations of produced particle                  tracks.  The major purpose of the experiment will be to search                  for the new state of nuclear matter, the quark-gluon plasma,                    which is predicted theoretically to be most likely created in                   heavy ion collisions.  The experiment represents a unique                       opportunity to study this high density phase of matter, since                   the new CERN sulfur ion beam will be nearly 50 times more                       energetic than any previous accelerator beams of particles                      having atomic numbers greater than Z=16.                                                                                                                        This project combines the expertise of two of the leading                       international research groups in the use of emulsion                            techniques for the study of nuclear interactions.  The                          proposed investigation is important and timely in making use                    of newly available energetic beams of heavy ions.",
