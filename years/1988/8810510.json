 "awd_abstract_narration": "The flux of X rays and ultraviolet radiation from the sun                  that is absorbed in the upper atmosphere breaks up molecules into               electrically charged ions and electrons that are heated in the                  process to temperatures over a thousand degrees.  This hot                      \"plasma\" expands and would escape the earth except that the                     charged particles are confined by the earth's magnetic field.                   Where the field lines are closed, which is out to about four                    earth radii in the equatorial regions, a relatively high density                of hot plasma fills the volume, called the \"plasmasphere.\"  The                 plasmasphere extends about 60o in latitude towards the poles.  In               the earth's polar caps the field lines are open and the plasma                  escapes upward, and some is lost from the earth, but some, while                still in the \"tail\" on open field lines in the larger                           \"magnetosphere\" is energized by electric fields due to a boundary               effect of the passing supersonic solar wind.  Some of this more                 highly energized terrestrial plasma then returns down the field                 lines and produces the spectacular aurora, and more heating in                  the polar upper atmosphere.  This award is for theoretical                      studies in several topics connected with plasma dynamics in the                 plasmasphere and magnetosphere.",
