Participants will include                  U.S., Middle Eastern, and Indian scientists.  Two main                          objectives are sought:  To stimulate scientific collaboration                   between U.S. and Middle Eastern research groups; And to                         discuss proposals for an interdisciplinary regional Laser                       Research Center in the Middle East.  The topics to be                           considered in the week-long meeting will include:  Basic                        atomic, molecular and optical physics; Atomic spectroscopy;                     Molecular spectroscopy; Laser-induced reactive and                              non-reactive Chemistry; Laser Chemical analysis;                                Laser-produced plasmas; Laser surface interactions; Small                       accelerator physics; and Biomedical application of lasers.                      The proposed Laser Research Center to be discussed would have                   a program for these activities:  conducting experimental                        research in physics, chemistry, biology, as well as medicine,                   agriculture and engineering; sponsor visits by scientists from                  abroad; training; and provide a central source of information                   about laser-based research.                                                                                                                                     Scope:  The workshop has received commitment for financial                      support from various organizations of the Government of                         Jordan, the UNESCO, the Royal Jordanian Scientific Society and                  from the International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP)                    in Trieste.  NSF support will be primarily for the cost of                      travel and per diem of U.S. scientists, and for travel of                       Indian scientists, as well as publication costs.  The project                   has the endorsement and backing of the Jordanian Higher                         Council of Science and Technology and the University of                         Jordan.  It is likely to lead to the enhancement of                             laser-based research in Jordan and other countries in the                       region and to increased collaboration with the U.S.",
