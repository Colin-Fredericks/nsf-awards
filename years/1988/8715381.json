 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research on Isolation                           of Iron Binding Protein of Reticulocyte Coated                                  Vesicles between Jonathan Glass of Louisiana State                              University and Marco Tulio Nunez of the University of                           Chile. These two scientists have had a long and                                 productive collaboration and in addition, interactions                          with other researchers in both countries.  Because of                           Glass's expertise in cell biology of iron metabolism,                           the first two tasks, development of an assay to detect                          an iron binding protein and its isolation will take                             place in his laboratory. Rapid progress is expected.                            Nunez will participate in this phase and then take the                          assay to Chile where the role of electrochemical                                gradients on translocation of iron across coated                                vesicle membranes will be studied. The Chileans have                            expertise in conduction across lipid bilayers and                               transport across vesicle membranes not available at                             LSU.                                                                                                                                                            Much of the preliminary work on this project has                                already been carried out. The collaboration has been                            productive and it is likely that significant data will                          be generated. This will add to the small amount of                              knowledge about iron transport across membranes in                              reticulocytes. Because the assay development will take                          place at LSU, work will be carried on in Chile which                            could not otherwise. This will benefit the university                           in Chile and the students there while LSU benefits                              from an experienced Latin American scientist.",
