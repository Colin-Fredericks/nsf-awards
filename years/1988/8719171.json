 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant permits Drs. Gero and Conkey to convene a group of 18                established reseachers for a five day conference: \"Women and                    Production in Prehistory.\" Fifteen of the participants will                     present substantive research papers and the remaining three will                serve as discussants. The specific topics include: the allocation               of gender roles in subsistence production; the organization of                  labor for commodity production; gender related factors in spatial               differention of labor and the relationships in prehistory of                    gender and status. The conference will be held in a  locale which               allows for focused interaction among the participants.                                                                                                          This conference is important because it should provide a new and                more balanced insight into prehistoric social organization and                  how archaeologists can work to understand it. Traditionally, and                probably because the majority of practicing archaeologists are                  men, women have been relatively invisible and there has been                    little consideration of the roles which they played in                          prehistory. This conference will not only help to right this bias               but also try to plot out a future research agenda.                                                                                                              This project is important not only for what it shall reveal about               the past but also for what it will tell us about how                            archaeologists work. An examination of this kind teaches much                   about implicit, usually unconscious, assumptions which                          archaeologists hold when they conduct research. The contribution                thus will be methodological as well as substantive.",
