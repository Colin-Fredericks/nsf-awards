 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past few years, the way in which simple word and sentence                contexts influence the processing of upcoming words during                      reading has come increasingly to be understood.  However, more                  needs to be understood about the way in which these fairly local                context effects are interrelated and combined with other                        information from paragraphs.  This research is designed to                      elucidate how readers combine distant paragraph information with                local sentence information in reading upcoming words in text.                   Specifically, the research will examine potential changes that                  may occur in word reading when expectations for particular words                derived on the basis of local sentence information are                          contradicted by information embedded more distantly in the                      paragraph.  The research will address several points:  First, it                will clarify whether paragraph information is continuallly                      combined with local information or whether effects from distant                 sources operate independently from local sources in the                         processing of upcoming words in text.  Second, the research will                examine the degree to which the predictability of local                         information affects how that distant information is used in                     reading words.  Last, the research will assess whether this                     distant information has its influence at the point at which the                 upcoming word is recognized or only later when the meaning of the               word is integrated with the meaning of the text.  The information               gained from this work will be useful in the development of                      guidelines for designing highly readable texts.",
