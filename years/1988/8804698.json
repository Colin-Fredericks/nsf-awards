 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Smulyan is examining the origins and organization of the                    American mass electronic media.  The familiar forms of radio and                television resulted from several factors.  Dr. Smulyan is                       examining how these factors combined to produce the first system                of broadcasting financed through the sale of time to advertisers.               Why and how did American broadcasting, which began free of                      advertisements, become commercialized?  How did this decision                   affect and how was it affected by the choice of technology to                   provide a national radio service?  The technology chosen was                    wired networks.  This choice changed programming and caused                     broadcasters to seek advertising to fund radio.  Wired national                 radio brought larger companies as sponsors, more expensive air                  time, harder hitting commercials, and big stars with proven                     appeal.  Despite protests, the 1934 Communications Act endorsed                 broadcasting's domination by wired networks and by advertisers.                 By working in the Division of Electricity of the National Museum                of American History, Dr. Smulyan will gain additional training in               history of technology and access to important manuscripts and                   periodicals in order better to incorportate the technical with                  the social, business and cultural factors affecting the course of               radio's development.",
