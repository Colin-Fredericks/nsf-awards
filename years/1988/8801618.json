 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the design, development and calibration of              diagnostic tools for high temperature fluidized beds.  An abrasion-             resistant heat flux transducer will be used to measure the local heat           flux between a high temperature fluidized bed and an immersed surface.          An optical probe will be developed to detect the local presence of              bubbles in high temperature beds.  The optical probe will be used to            measure the bubble size distribution, bubble rise speed, and                    volumetric bubble fraction.  After the devices have been developed and          calibrated, they will be used to understand the heat transfer in high           temperature fluidized beds under a variety of operating conditions.                                                                                             Considerable attention has been devoted to the development of                   fluidized bed combustion processes for high sulfur coal and other               solid fuels since the sulfur emissions from this technology can easily          meet the air quality standards.  Fluidized bed combustors also have             the advantage of flexibility in regard to fuel type because they can            be designed to burn several different types of fuels.  Most of the              previous studies of instantaneous local bed-to-surface heat transfer            measurements are restricted to near room temperature conditions.  The           advancement of our understanding of fluidized beds requires the                 experimental characterization of the high temperature phenomena.  This          project will provide the experimental devices and data to meet this             overall objective.",
