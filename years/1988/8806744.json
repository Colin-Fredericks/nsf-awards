 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this project is the assessment of the                       magnitude, location and significance of the conformational                      changes that produce NMR spectral changes upon introduction                     of point mutations in the active site of Staphylococcal                         nuclease (Snase).  The study will allow investigation of how                    single site amino acid changes affect the inhibitor-enzyme                      interaction as well as the conformation of the protein and                      how the conformational changes induced by amino acid                            replacement are related to changes in enzyme activity.  In                      addition, there will be continued efforts on the development of                 novel NMR experiments to probe with more reliability the                        interactions of interest and on the development of computer                     aided means of analysing NMR data.                                                                                                                              The conformation of molecules bound to the active sites of                      enzymes is of importance in determining how enzymes catalyze                    reactions, which interactions are important in determining                      enzyme specificity and in the design of new inhibitors of                       enzymes.  This program is the only one in the Wesleyan                          Chemistry Department concerned with questions of mutagenesis                    as well as with determinations of protein structure and function.               This allows undergraduate students to partake in a broad and                    viable research effort.",
