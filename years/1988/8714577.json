 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between                          Professor Abraham Klein of the University of                                    Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and Dr. G. Do Dang of the                           Laboratory of Theoretical Physics and High Energies,                            University of Paris (South).  They will examine                                 applications of a new theory of large amplitude                                 collective motion, which may account for certain forms                          of collective rotational or vibrational motion in                               atomic nuclei.  The two researchers have been working                           since 1984 on this new theory, which is a development                           in quantum-mechanical terms of the classical                                    Hartree-Fock formulation.  The Wigner transform is                              used to make the required quantum transformations.                                                                                                              Following the development of the new theory, its                                applicability to systems of practical importance will                           be examined.  This award provides the opportunity for                           Professor Klein and Dr. Do Dang to apply the theory to                          the description of large deviations from ground-state                           equilibrium configurations, well described by                                   classical Hartree-Fock models.  This research could                             lead to increased understanding of large-amplitude                              problems in classical mechanics, and of certain                                 problems in both fission and fusion reactions.",
