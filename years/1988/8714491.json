 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Tribology of crystalline semiconductors and ceramics is                     critical to the utilization of these materials in high technology               applications.  For example, semiconductors used for large-scale                 integrated circuits are cut by diamond impregnated wheels and,                  lapped and polished in fluids that contain abrasive particles.                  Ceramics are being used as abrasion resistant coatings in                       reciprocating engines and other machines where surfaces are                     moving at a relative velocity so that the ceramic coating is                    abraded due to inadvertent contact of these surfaces.  The                      contact of an abrasive particle with a crystalline semiconductor                or ceramic damages the surfaces of these materials.  This damage                is detrimental because it creates cracks which can lead to                      catastrophic brittle failure.  There is currently no quantitative               model which can predict the mode or extent of this damage.  This                project develops a unique model and, simple and straightforward                 tribological experiments that can be used to determine and                      eventually predict the deformation mechanisms of crystalline                    semiconductors and ceramics.  The results of this research will                 be valuable to industry and may be utilized to optimize cutting,                lapping and polishing crystalline semiconductors and minimize the               abrasive wear of ceramic coatings.",
