 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. M. Thomas Record, Department         of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin, to pursue with Dr. Jung-Hye Roe,         Department of Microbiology, Seoul National University, for a period of          24 months, a program of cooperative research on DNA sequence effects on         open complex formation by RNA polymerase.  The effect of sequence               variations near the transcriptional start site on the rate of formation         and dissociation of the open complex will be studied.  The three-step           mechanism of open-complex formation, proposed by the collaborators in           previous research, will be examined in an attempt to identify                   intermediate steps.  In particular, the effects of sequence variations          on the rates of association and dissociation under various solution             conditions will be studied.                                                                                                                                     In prokaryotes the extent and the timing of gene expression is                  regulated primarily at the level of transcription initiation.                   Transcriptional control requires the interaction of specific proteins           with specific sites on DNA.  In the present research, site-specific             mutagenesis of E. coli DNA will be employed to study the effect of the                         _  ____                                                          introduction of variant promoters on the rates of formation and                 dissociation of open complexes of RNA polymerase under different                conditions of temperature, concentrations of cations and anions, etc.           Drs. Record and Roe are highly respected scientists who have                    successfully collaborated previously in this field of research.  This           project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative             Science Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation                between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange           of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through            collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.",
