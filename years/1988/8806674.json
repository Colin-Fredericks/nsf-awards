 "awd_abstract_narration": "The equipment provided by this project allows three investigators               who recently have been awarded an NSF \"minicenter\" grant to study               cell separations mediated by receptor-ligand interactions.  The                 surface force instrument (SFI) provides direct information on the               strength of such bonds, the distances over which they are                       effective, and in the case of fluid membrane surfaces (modeled by               lipid bilayers deposited on the mica surfaces) how rapidly the                  bond-forming molecules can diffuse into close proximity to one                  another.  The transport of molecules through membranes is also of               great interest to two other researchers.  The SFI provides direct               information on the partitioning of molecules between pore                       (modeled by the thin slit \"pore\" of the two mica surfaces) and                  bulk liquid.  Predictions suggesting an oscillatory variation in                the partition coefficient as pore radius changes can be tested.                 Many fundamental materials properties are directly dependent on                 intermolecular forces.  These properties, in turn, are used                     directly in chemical engineering calculations to predict and                    correlate polymer solubility, colloid stability, adhesion,                      membrane permeation, adsorption, and other phenomena.  In the                   past, it has been necessary to use derived quantities as a                      measure of these interactions.  The SFI permits direct                          measurement of these forces and how they vary with position.  It                therefore has the potential for making important contributions to               many areas of chemical engineering:  in producing accurate                      \"first-principles\" data, in testing theoretical predictions based               on molecular interactions, and i helping to produce improved                    correlating functions.",
