 "awd_abstract_narration": "The acquisition of nine spectrophotometers is providing modern,                 reliable instruments for first through fourth year chemistry                    laboratories.  New and revised experiments using spectrophotometric             techniques are being introduced at all levels.  First year chemistry            laboratory students are utilizing four spectrophotometers interfaced            with microcomputers to acquire data from three experiments to quantify          a chemical equilibrium constant, the percentage of manganese in steel,          and a kinetics rate law expression.  Nonscience curricula students in           another laboratory course are spectrophotometrically determining the            iron content of some common foods.  Students in second year                     quantitative analysis are using four microprocessor controlled                  spectrophotometers also linked to a microcomputer to determine two              metals in mixtures and phosphorous in blood serum.  The students are            also isolating and identifying lycopene and beta-carotene from tomatoes         by using a scanning ultraviolet-visible spectrometer.  Students in              organic chemistry are being introduced to scanning uv-visible                   spectrophotometry in a study of the isomerization of an alkene.  Upper          division chemistry curriculum students are using the same scanning uv-          visible spectrophotometer to determine ligand field characteristics,            stability constants, and identify compounds.                                                                                                                    The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.",
