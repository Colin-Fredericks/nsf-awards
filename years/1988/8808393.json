 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research effort proposed here consists of three parts:  MBE growth          of nonlinear materials, semiconductor physics of those materials,               and nonlinear devices using those materials.                                                                                                                    Attention will be focused initially on growing GaAs.based structures            and devices such as bulk, single. and multiple.quantum.well samples,            Fabry.Perot etalons with monolithic mirrors, as well as starting                material for nonlinear waveguides and quantum dot structures.                                                                                                   The optical properties of the samples will be studied, with                     special emphasis on the linear and nonlinear optical properties in the          spectral regions below the exciton.  Studying the absorption tail and           its saturation under high excitation is not only very interesting               physics, but also helpful for characterizing the quality of the grown           samples, and essential for optimum device design and operation.                 Absorption tail, carrier lifetime, and polarization dependence of the           bandgap nonlinearities will be investigated as functions of quantum             well widths, growth conditions, and device design.                                                                                                              Microlithography and anisotropic etching techniques will be used,               to fabricate nonlinear waveguide structures such as directional                 couplers and Mach.Zehnder interferometers, as well as arrays of                 semiconductor etalons. Methods to manipulate the carrier lifetime and,          hence, the response time of the nonlinear devices will be                       investigated, and devices will be designed for both low.power                   operation at relatively low speed and forultrafast optical switching.",
