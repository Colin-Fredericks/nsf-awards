 "awd_abstract_narration": "A significant amount of effort and time is devoted to debugging in all          phases of software development cycle.  In fact, debugging is one of the         sources for the software crisis the computer industry is facing today.          To diagnose and fix an error, it is necessary to reproduce the error.           Generally, reproduction of an error is not possible in real-time                software systems because of the timing constraints involved and their           non-deterministic characters.  The unpredictable sequence in which the          inputs arrive at a certain point in time will not exhibit the same              behavior of the system upon repeated execution of the program.  This            project will develop a methodology for knowledge-based debugging of             real-time software systems.  A program execution monitoring method is           first used to record a system execution history in a non-interfering            manner--that is without corrupting the critical timing requirements of          the target system.  The traces, thus collected are analyzed to isolate          the bug in an off-line mode.  The examination of voluminous traces is a         laborious and boring task that requires a high degree of expertise.             This expertise is encapsulated into a knowledge-based system and the            examination process automated to at least localize the fault and answer         questions about its reasoning.  Such an approach will definitely                shorten the overall debugging time and contribute towards software              productivity and reliability.",
