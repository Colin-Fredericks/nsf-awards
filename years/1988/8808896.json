 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to study the control of                   articulated objects performing complex actions.  Motion analysis                will be approached from a computational perspective viewing                     actions as directed by coordinated processes that specify torques               and forces on objects to accomplish purposive behavior.  The                    project will study the problems that arise when objects have many               degrees of freedom, when tasks lack precise specification, when                 unpredictable events and interactions with other objects are                    commonplace, and when the consequences of actions cannot be                     precisely determined before the action is performed.                                 The project will emphasize fundamental principles for                      programming complex physical object.  Methods for representing                  objects, specifying tasks, and reasoning about actions will be                  addressed.  Techniques for adaptive, event driven control of                    concurrent motor functions will be investigated.  Particular                    emphasis will be placed on coordination and methods for                         maintaining stability and balance.  The work will contribute to                 the ongoing design of a system in which theories of action and                  control can be easily posed as computational processes and                      empirically tested in simulation.  The physical object simulator                Newton will be used to accomplish the work.",
