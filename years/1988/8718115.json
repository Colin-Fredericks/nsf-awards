The specific objectives                                                                                               are:                                                                                                                                                              l.  to establish quantitative relationships between the                       occupation of sites in DNA, with which gyrase intereacts                        strongly, and the superhelix density of the DNA molecule in which                                                                                               the sites reside.                                                                                                                                                 2.  to examine how transcription influences the interaction of                gyrase with particular sites in plasmid DNA in the vicinity of a                strong, inducible promoter.                                                                                                                                       3.  to map naturally occurring sites on the chromosome where                  gyrase interacts with DNA in the vicinity of an inducible operon                before and after induction, and                                                                                                                                   4.  to study the dynamics of gyrase-chromosome interactions.                  The latter studies will include chromosomal and cytoplasmic                     gyrase are in rapid exchange, whether cytoplasmic gyrase shows a                preference for binding to newly-replicated DNA or for binding to                actively transcribing DNA, and whether gyrase exhibits a                        preference for binding to DNA during specific phases of the cell                cycle.                                                                                                                                                          The chromosome of E. coli exists as a circular DNA molecule that                must be compacted more than 1000-fold in order to fit inside the                cell.  Compaction is accomplished in part by supercoiling or                    twisting of the DNA as a result of the action of the enzymes                    known as topoisomerses that control DNA supercoiling.  In                       addition to compacting the genome, supercoiling also influences                 many of the biological activities of DNA such as transcription                  and replication.  Dr. Drlica's project is designed to investigate               the interactions that occur between gyrase and the bacterial                    chromosome and to determine the relationship between supercoiling               and gene expression.",
