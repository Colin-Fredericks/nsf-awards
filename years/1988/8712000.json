 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal requests funds to purchase a DNA synthesizer and                   printer, spectrophotometer, and fraction collector.  The                        instrumentation will be located in a university-wide service                    laboratory that will operate on a fee basis and will give focus                 to research in molecular biology/biotechnology.  The                            instrumentation will be of particular benefit to researchers                    working on the expression of genes during sea urchin embryonic                  development and the role of the gene products in the                            developmental processes, measurement of changes of nuclear DNA in               evolution, erythropoietic system, the role of a transposable                    ement during evolution of Hawaiian Drosophila, structure/function               aspects of proteins and their genes, molecular biology of                       development of higher plants and fungi, genome organization and                 DNA sequence evolution, and role of toxins produced by plant                    pathogenic bacteria in the pathogenesis of their host plants.                   The need for the instrumentation is critical, and the quality of                research warrants support.",
