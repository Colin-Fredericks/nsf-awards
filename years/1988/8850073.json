 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program will bring eighteen high school students (grades 10-12) to         the campus of Texas A&M University for career orientation and                   instruction relevant to science and engineering, with special emphasis          on Chemical Engineering.  Students from small, rural, and predominantly         minority high schools will be targeted.  The program duration will be           four weeks, beginning June 6, 1988, and the students will reside in             dormitories on the Texas A&M campus. Activities will include work on a          research project under the direction of a Chemical Engineering faculty          member, lectures, seminars, discussions, and field trips.  The                  instruction, discussions, and field trips will emphasize career                 orientation, communications skills (both written and oral), and problem         solving methodology (both in class and with microcomputers).                    Instructors will include Chemical Engineering faculty and graduate              students, staff from the Speech Communications Department, invited              speakers from other areas of the campus and industry representatives.",
