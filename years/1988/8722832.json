 "awd_abstract_narration": "The microwave and millimeter wave industry is one whose                    products form the backbone to the development of space/satellite                communication, guidance and control, broadcasting, remote-sensing               and navigation systems.  Its application areas are therefore                    broadly-based.  Advance in microwave is recognized by many as                   being critically important to our nation's interest because of its              defense system applications as well as commercial applications.                 As a nation, we are faced with the challenge as to how we can                   maintain a lead in R&D, increase the output of U.S. engineers, and              more importantly, build a strong infrastructure in microwave and                millimeter wave engineering.  The University of Colorado and                    industry recognize this challenge and are cooperating to establish              an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Microwave                and Millimeter Wave Computer-Aided Design.                                           The Center already has $350,000 support from industry and                  $100,000 support from government laboratories.  Five additional                 companies have also indicated their intention to join the Center                at $50,000/year each.  The University of Colorado has agreed to                 forego its overhead charges (approximately $200,000/per year).  In              addition, there are adequate computers, laboratory space and                    instruments for the proposed research at the university.  One of                the sponsors, NBS/Boulder Laboratories, has agreed to have their                facilities used for some of the required research.  The proposed                research includes:                                                                   (1)  Loss Mechanisms in Planar Lines                                            (2)  A Highly-Accurate Numerical Modeling of Microstrip                              Junction Discontinuities                                                   (3)  In-Situ Sampling of Microwave/Millimeter-Wave Waveforms                    (4)  Parasitic Coupling Models for CAD                                          (5)  A Generalized Program for Two-Dimensional Analysis of                           Microstrip Circuits                                                        (6)  Discontinuity Reactance Compensation by Geometrical                             Modification of Discontinuity Configuration in GaAs                             Microstrip Circuits                                                        (7)  Evaluation of Radiation from Microstrip Discontinuities                         in Gallium Arsenide Circuits.                                              The principal investigator, Dr. David C. Chang, is chairman                of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.  He has               assembled a balanced group of strong senior, intermediate and                   junior faculty who have the capability to establish and run an                  I/UCR Center.                                                                        An NSF continuing grant of $50,000 per year for five years is              recommended.  For years 2-5, $50,000 will be awarded on an annual               basis.  The Program Director will review annually the progress of               the Center on a number of criteria, including:                                       (1)  the extent to which university/industry interaction and                         collaboration are developing;                                              (2)  the extent to which the support base for the center is                          expanding; and                                                             (3)  the extent to which a robust research program is                                developing.",
