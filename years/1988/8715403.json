 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of electrochemistry.  Within the                  broad area of chemically modified electrodes, three research                    themes are being pursued: (1) fundamental investigations of                     electrochemical reactions of and in polymeric media; (2)                        development of microstructured electrode systems and their                      applications to polymer studies; and (3) basic and applied                      studies of electron transfer chemistry, electroanalysis,                        electrocatalysis, and transport processes in polymer phases.                    Specifically, electron self exchange reactions that are driven by               intense electrical potential gradients applied to non-ionically                 conductive, mixed valent electroactive polymers are being                       studied, electrochemical techniques to study transport processes                in polymer phases are being developed, the effects of polymer                   viscosity and elevated temperatures on the rates of heterogeneous               reactions at polymer/electrode interfaces are being probed, new                 electrocatalytic routes for the activation of dioxygen as a                     useful synthetic reagent are being devised, and new                             electrochemical processes for the formation of thin polymeric                   films are being explored.                                                                                                                                       This research should yield new insights into the fundamental                    physical chemistry of polymers that will enable their effective                 utilization in novel electrochemical sensor technology.                         Additionally, new electrosynthetic processes that lead to useful                materials are expected to be identified.",
