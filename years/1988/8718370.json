 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC) proposes to                  implement a regional communication network for its member schools               and would also serve other institutions in the seven - state                    region.  The initial set of schools and the states that would be                included in the network are:  Illinois- University of Chicago,                  University of Illinois, Northwestern University; Iowa -                         University of Iowa; Michigan - University of Michigan, Michigan                 State University; Ohio - Ohio State University, Indiana - Indiana               University, Purdue University; Wisconsin - University of                        Wisconsin; and Minnesota - University of Minnesota.                               The NSF would provide partial support for a high bandwidth (1.5               million bits per second) data communication network that will                   support access to regional and national computational resources                 and unique data bases, communication among researchers especially               for project collaboration, and university - industry cooperation                and technology transfer.                                                          A star topology is proposed with T-1 lines emanating from a hub               at the University of Chicago to each of the CIC institutions.                   The central hub will be managed by a CICNet Network Support                     Center.  A corporate partner will install and manage the the T-1                lines.  At each university CICNet access will be through a                      gateway to the local campus network.  The network will initially                be connected to the NSF backbone network at the University of                   Illinois--Urbana-Champaign.  All components will utilize the                    NSFNet standard TCP/IP protocols.                                                 Each campus will provide local networking infrastructure for                  CICNet, including technical support and user information                        services.  The Network Support Center will provide coordination                 and technical support for the campuses.  Financing and                          operational plans call for a steadily decreasing reliance upon                  support from NSF and corporate partners, with full responsibility               for all aspects of CICNet devolving onto CIC at the conclusion of               five years.  NSF support will be for the first 2 1/2 years only.",
