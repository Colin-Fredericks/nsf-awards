 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Institute of Ecosystem Studies' Research Experiences for                    Undergraduates (IES-REU) program will immerse eight students in a               highly interactive, research-oriented environment.  The program                 will expose students to the whole context of research, not just                 to the procedures of a particular discipline.  The philosophy of                the program has four themes: (1) science is a community activity;               (2) a variety of strategies is available to attack scientific                   problems; (3) all research has a theoretical context; and (4) all               research has a social context.  The students will generate                      hypotheses, select methods and develop research designs in                      collaboration with a mentor.  The project options will focus on                 both terrestrial and aquatic systems, and provide exposure to a                 variety of trophic levels.  The program is designed so that                     students will interact with each other, the staff of the                        Education Program, other scientists and students at IES, and                    visitors and speakers from the academic and public policy arenas.               In this way the philosophical themes of the program will be woven               into each student's experience.  The program will conclude with a               day-long symposium given by the student researchers.  An IES                    Occasional Publication will also be prepared incorporating the                  students' final reports.",
