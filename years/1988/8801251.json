This Congress, to be                   convened under the auspices of the Czechoslovak National                        Committee of Biochemistry, The Czechoslovak Biochemical Society,                and the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry,                        Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences and the IUB, will be held in                   Prague, Czechoslovakia during the period July 10-15, 1988.  A                   Travel Award Committee will be named to select from applicants                  those best qualified to represent U.S. biochemistry with due                    regard for equitable distribution of grants based on geographic                 location, scientific interest, minority status, age,                            identification with learned and professional societies,                         participation in past Congresses, and general standing in the                   scientific community.  In addition to the grant support, the                    American Society of Biological Chemists and the American Chemical               Society will contribute over $400,000 toward travel support.                                                                                                    This is an important international meeting, and the travel                      support provided will help to assure an appropriate level of                    participation by U.S. biochemists.",
