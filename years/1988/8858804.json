 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first project is on extendable systems, systems in which a user can         add capabilities that were not originally anticipated by the designer.          Many such extendable systems exist-such as Emacs, Excel, and Tex-but            several key problems with extension mechanism have not been solved.             Reduced cost of constructing extendable applications by providing a             system-wide extension mechanism (called the Extension Interpreter) that         is shared by all applications, and reduced problems of users having to          learn new extension programming languages for each extendable                   application by using existing languages (such as C and Icon) as                 extension programming languages have been achieved.  Currently                  exploring the degree to which these approaches support not only                 extension but also the dynamic construction of large software systems           is underway.                                                                                                                                                    A second project is on environments for parallel programming (this is           joint work with Professors L. Snyder and L. Adams).  As a follow-on to          work on Gandalf (and Snyder's work on Poker), a graphical environment           in which parallel programmers explicitly define their programs through          a number of views (for instance, a communication graph view and an              input/output view) is being built.                                                                                                                              The third project is on heterogeneous computing systems (joint work             with Professors Lazowska, Levy, and Zahorjan).  The overall goal of the         project is to reduce the costs of introducing a new system type (such           as a Micro Vax, a Lisp Machine, or a Tektronix Pegasus) into the                department computing environment.  This project combines research in            both software engineering and also distributed systems.  Current work           covers heterogeneous filing and heterogeneous remote procedure call, as         well as understanding and carefully describing the software structure-          emulation, indirection, and interpretation-that have come up repeatedly         in this project.",
