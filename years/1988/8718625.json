 "awd_abstract_narration": "The accessory gland of the D. melanogaster male secretes                    products that, when transferred to females during mating, cause                 these females to increase oviposition, lose sexual receptivity,                 and maintain viable sperm.  Dr. Wolfner has identified three                    abundant accessory gland-specific transcripts that encode                       polypeptides with signals for secretion and processing to smaller               peptides.  The goals of the proposed research are to characterize               the regulation of these genes and to investigate the role of                    their polypeptides in fertility.  Dr. Wolfner will determine the                developmental regulation of the expression of the genes, and                    whether frequent multiple matings affect their expression by                    Northern blot analysis. A regulatory region of one of these genes               will be defined, and used in a novel method to ablate particular                accessory gland cells.  The effect of this ablation on the                      synthesis of male-specific RNAs and upon fertility will be                      determined.  The function of each gene will be determined in                    three ways. Antibodies which recognize its product will be used                 to follow the fate of that product after mating.  The gene                      product will be introduced into females and its effects observed.               Finally screens for mutants in one of the genes under study will                be carried out.                                                                    Dr. Wolfner has clones for genes that code for potential                     precursors to hormones that affect reproductive behavior. This                  provides important tools for the study of hormone receptors,                    behavior as well as the process of sexual differentiation.",
