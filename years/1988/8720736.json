 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diamondiferous kimberlites are closely associated with stable                   Archean cratons, whereas diamond=bearing olivine lamproites are                 intruded into adjacent mobile belts.  However, a newly discovered               diamond field in NW Syria differs from both these settings.                     Clusters of rift-induced diamond-bearing eruptives into Jurassic                dolomites of the western block of the Syria Graben are dated at                 110-115 m.y., similar in age to the Mesozoic reuptive event in                  southern, west and east Africa, brazil, North America, and                      Siberia.  Diamond host rocks in syria are neither kimberlites nor               lamproites, but some approach the composition of essexite or                    basanite.  Samples of unweathered drill cores are exotic polymict               volcanoclastic breccias with serpeintine, glass and mineral                     fragments set in a carbonate matrix.  Upper mantle-derived                      xenoliths are garnet lherzolite, dunite and discrete megacrysts                 of ilmenite, diopside, and garnet.  Crustal xenoliths are garnet                granulites, gabbros, and amphibolites.                                          The N-S Syria Graben is an extension of the East African,                       Ethiopian, Afar, Red Sea and Dead Sea Rift systems, parts of                    which have been continuously active since at least the Jurassic.                Rift-induced alkali magmatic sampling of paleo-kimberlites or                   lamproites in pre-existing conduits is one possible model for the               generation of the non-trrditional diamond host rocks in the                     Arabian Plate of NW Syria.                                                      This unusual tectonic setting and the exotic nature of the hybrid               diamond host rocks is the focus of this proposal.  Bulk and                     mineral chemical and stable isotope techniques will be applied to               test the hybridization model, or alternatively to establish that                these are indeed primary upper mantle melt products from within                 the diamond stability field.",
