 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important aspect of the current crisis in engineering education is           the need to improve the state of undergraduate engineering and science          laboratories.  Recent advances in computer and instrumentation                  technology have increased computational power and versatility while             dramatically reducing cost.  Thus the individual scientist and engineer         now has the potential for conducting experiments with a precision and           sophistication not achievable previously.  Industries are already using         automated computer-assisted measurement and control systems to increase         productivity and universities are starting to realize the value of              workstations.  However, educated faculty are needed to transmit the             capabilities of the workstation to students.  Bucknell began the                implementation of engineering workstations across the undergraduate             curricula three years ago, and currently it is using them in most of            its engineering laboratories.                                                                                                                                   Bucknell will conduct two five-day workshops for a total of 40                  engineering and science faculty on the use of integrated engineering            workstations in undergraduate laboratories.  The participants will              develop an experiment and class material for implementation at their            institution.  Bucknell faculty will sustain the development of the              experiments by providing continued interaction through BITNET.                                                                                                  Participants will be educated in current laboratory technologies by             interacting with workstations to perform science and engineering                experiments.  The project will emphasize the philosophy and techniques          required to develop modern computer-controlled experiments for students         developing a creative problem-solving ability.",
