 "awd_abstract_narration": "An integrated research program is proposed to develop mathematical              models for strategic planning of logistics systems in which a central           depot routes vehicles to replenish depleting inventories of spatially           dispersed customers.  The models will incorporate such system                   complexities as probabilistic customer demands, local inventory                 holding capacities, vehicle capacities, cost of alternative vehicle             types, point-to-point travel times, and nonlinear \"loading\" and \"off            loading\" times.  The effort is directed to assist system designers to           address important strategic problems such as:  1) fleet sizing and              mix; 2) determining vehicle capacities; 3) determining local inventory          holding capacities; 4) investigating alternative technologies for               \"loading\" and \"off loading\"; 5) designing the logistics system with or          without transhipment points; 6) designing hierarchial distribution              networks.  The work is directed at complimenting important work done            over the past five years in tactical inventory/routing problems.  The           new methodologies will be tested with data from operating systems.                                                                                              Dick Larson is extremely qualified and based on past performance is             very likely to provide breakthroughs in modeling integrated systems             that will be fundamental to operational science.",
