In order to help remedy this               situation, the student during the course of this project will                   analyze data from the recently excavated site of Jiangzhai which                dates to the Yangshao period (ca. 6300 b.p.).                                        The student will analyze the spatial organization of                       Jiangzhai in order to understand the social organization of the                 village.  He will test a hypothesis that the village was                        organized around a segmentary system thereby increasing knowledge               about prehistoric societies and the way they were organized.                    Specifically, this research project will provide new information                on the organization of early neolithic communities in China.                         Significantly, the student has the support of Chinese                      archaeologists.  This means that he will have the opportunity to                open a vast new geographical area to U.S. archaeologists and at                 the same time increase international cooperation and                            collaboration.",
