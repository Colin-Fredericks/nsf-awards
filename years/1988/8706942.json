 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will examine the relationship between ion absorption                 rate, relative growth rate, and the soil nutrient dependence of a               suite of forest tree species that vary widely in both relative                  growth rate and canopy gap colonization ability.  It is                         hypothesized that:                                                                                                                                              1)  Gap colonizing species with high relative growth rates will                 have higher maximum ion absorption capacities than slowly growing               species;                                                                                                                                                        2)  Shade tolerant species with low relative growth rates will                  have higher root absorption capacities at low nutrient                          concentrations than fast growing, gap colonizing species;                                                                                                       3)  These differences will be greatest for soil mobile ions such                as NO3 and K and less for soil immobile ions such as PO4 and                    NH4;                                                                                                                                                            4)  Nutrient uptake rates will be greater for seedlings                         acclimated to low nutrient conditions than to high nutrient                     conditions, and that this plasticity will be greater for                        species with high relative growth rates;                                                                                                                        5)  In the field, gap colonizing seedlings will be more                         responsive than slowly growing, shade tolerant species not                      only to increased light availability in gap sites but also                      to increased nutrient availability in fertilized sites.                                                                                                         Six tree species of the eastern deciduous forest will be grown                  from seed.  Three of these species represent gap colonizing                     species with high relative growth rates (Prunus serotina, Quercus               coccinea, and Betula populifolia), and three represent shade                    tolerant species with low relative growth rates (Fraxinus                       americana, Carya ovata, and Quercus borealis).  Three separate                  experiments will be performed to test the hypotheses.",
