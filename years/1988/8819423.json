 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goals of this project are to understand the                       molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and function of the               triad junction in muscle cells.  This is a junction between                     plasma and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes that is thought                to have a critical role in coupling excitation and muscle                       contraction.  This research will establish the developmental                    history of a key element of the triad junction, the \"foot\"                      protein in embryonic and neonatal chick skeletal muscle, in order               to gain insight into the role of this protein in junction                       formation, muscle morphogenesis and the biogenesis of SR                        membranes.  The plant alkaloid, ryanodine, binds specifically to                the \"foot\" protein; this compound is, thus, a useful experimental               probe of this protein.  The developmental time course of the                    appearance of the \"foot\" or ryanodine-binding protein (RBP) and                 of the manifestation of its ability to bind ryanodine and to                    alter the calcium permeability of SR membranes will be examined.                The appearance of the \"foot\" protein will be measured by specific               tritiated ryanodine binding, and detection of the 400-500 kDa RBP               using SDS-PAGE and RBP specific antibodies.  The appearance of                  \"foot\" protein function will be assayed by measurement of                       intracellular calcium transients and contractile activity.  These               events will be correlated with the development of a mature muscle               morphology and SR function in pectoral muscle from embryonic and                neonatal chicks and primary cultures of embryonic muscle as                     visualized using electron microscopy and immunocytochemical                     techniques.                                                                                                                                                     The results of this research should contribute substantially to                 our understanding of the mechanism by which excitation of the                   surface membrane of a striated muscle cell triggers calcium                     release from an intracellular compartment, the sarcoplasmic                     reticulum, as the key step in initiation of muscle contraction.",
