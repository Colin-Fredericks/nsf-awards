 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous studies demonstrate that antarctic meteorites                     differ from non-antarctic falls in frequency of type.  Antarctica               sampled at least one, perhaps more, extraterrestrial populations                in the past, different from that falling today elsewhere on                     earth.  The research objectives of this project are threefold:                  to determine if the chemical weathering scale established for                   antarctic H/L chondrite ratio is a weathering artifact; to study                the extent to which the nature of antarctic populations is site-                and time-dependent; to chemically investigate antarctic                         meteorites of unique or rare type so as to establish chemical and               thermal conditions during their formation.  This research should                enable the PI to use meteorites to further study the recent (<10                year) history and dynamics of the antarctic ice sheet.                          Additionally, it should enable the PI to establish in what ways                 the near-earth meteoroid complex changed with time, how the                     changes relate to ice sheet history, and what they signify about                the nature of meteorite parent bodies.",
