 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will examine flows which involve two                         immiscible fluids.  For such flows, there are a number of                       theoretical possibilities for the shape of the boundary which                   separates the two fluids.  However, experimental results indicate               that some boundary shapes are preferred over others.  This work                 will investigate the selection mechanisms for boundary shapes.                  Physical modeling, analytical, and computational techniques will                be used to study the stability of various stable arrangements and               the appearance of new arrangements from unstable configurations.                     This work could lead to a better understanding of practical                applications including the formation of bicomponent fibers,                     transport of oil in pipelines, ink-jet printing, and lubrication                with two fluids.",
