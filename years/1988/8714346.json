 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research program involves an experimental and analytical                    investigation of the quasi-static and impact energy dissipation                 characteristics of structural systems containing metallic tubes as              energy dissipating elements.                                                                                                                                    The specific objectives of the research include the following five              tasks.  In Task 1, the energy dissipation characteristics of clusters           of unstiffened and stiffened tubular assemblies will be optimized               with respect to their intertubular boundary conditions, their radius            to wall thickness ratios, and their strain-hardening and strain-rate            properties.  Task 2 is concerned with establishing the importance of            the initial elastic response of tubes subjected to impact loading               resulting in an elastic-viscoplastic response.  In Task 3, non-                 uniform tubular collapse modes will be studied.  Task 4 will                    investigate the behavior of composite (foam-filled) metallic tubes              under large deformation conditions.  Finally, Task 5 will generalize            the one-dimensional structural shock-wave theory developed in                   previous NSF funded research to two dimensions and employ it to model           the impact experiments of Task 1.                                                                                                                               This research will fill a void in this area of impact mechanics and             provide results directly applicable to the development of more                  efficient and effective metallic energy dissipating systems.  Such              systems have a life saving potential when employed in safety                    applications where kinetic energy must be dissipated in a                       controlled manner such that decelerations remain within allowable               limits.",
