 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is focused on developing methods which increase              the reliability and efficiency of Numerically Controlled (NC)                   machining.  The award will be used to purchase a five axis machining            center to experimentally test the concepts.                                          The development of variational geometric models is an important            topic of current research.  The equipment purchased by this award               will help the principal investigator's investigate how tolerance                information contained within the geometric model of a mechanical                part can be used to automate the selection of spindle speeds and                feedrates in a NC milling operation.  The tolerance information can             be used to calculate the allowable cutting forces if the stiffness              of both the workpiece and the machine tool is known.  Geometric and             mechanistic models of the cutting process will then be used to                  select appropriate speed/feed settings which result in actual                   cutting forces below the allowable threshold.  Finally, force                   sensing during machining can be used to adapt to spindle speeds and             feedrates to maintain acceptable tolerances and surfaces finishes.                   The practical realization of the stated goal requires two                  advances in the current state of the art:  (1) an efficient                     geometric simulation method capable of verifying tolerance                      discrepancies, and (2) a reliable and complete model of the cutting             process, capable of estimating cutting forces for a wide range of               cutting conditions.",
