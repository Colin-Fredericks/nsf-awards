The study will examine processes                   through which hazards interact with social and cultural factors                 to amplify or attenuate public responses to risk.  The specific                 objectives of the project are (1) to integrate different social                 responses to risk events into a coherent theory of risk                         amplification, and (2) to examine patterns of risk amplification                across a diverse set of hazards and event scenarios, based on a                 detailed review of case studies.                                                                                                                                Despite the importance of integrative approaches to risk                        assessment, little research has been directed toward developing a               systematic approach that takes into account the broader social                  and cultural implications of a risk event.  This innovative                     project will both develop a theoretical basis for this                          integration and validate the approach using case studies.  It is                expected that the results of the study will contribute to the                   development of better understanding of why some risk events are                 amplified and others not, and provide risk analysts and decision                makers with a more comprehensive basis for addressing difficult                 risk problems.",
