 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although the implementation of computer use in undergraduate               education had successfully permeated every facet of this department's           curriculum, the microcomputer application to data acquisition and               analysis had not yet been initiated systematically.  Outdated                   physiological instruments had started to become a hindrance to the full         development of the instructional program.  With equipment proved                through this project, the faculty is revising and upgrading the student         work stations with microcomputer-interfaced instrumentation.                                                                                                         Modernization of the Introductory Physiology lab benefits many             related upper-level courses.  Students are able to engage in hands-on           experimentation with improved quality and quantity.  They also gain             easier access to computer simulations and computer-aided lessons.               Furthermore, they have a chance to learn and master state-of-the-art            techniques in data acquisition and analysis.  Finally, the new                  instrumentation permits new experiments and research projects to be             developed for independent research and senior honors work, an important         part of the institution's ongoing efforts to provide its women a strong         basic science foundation for graduate studies and subsequent careers in         science.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
