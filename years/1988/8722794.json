 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award partially supports Professors Keith Nelson and Philip Prinz          of Pennsylvania State University for collaborative research in                  linguistics with Professors Siegmund Prillwitz of the University of             Hamburg and Inger Ahlgren, Lenore Arnberg and Peter Arnberg of the              University of Stockholm.  They are collaborating in research designed to        further our understanding of the processes by which children utilize            available language input in order to analyze and acquire new rules and          skills in different linguistic modes (spoken, written and signed).              Prior and continuing experimental and observational research by the             American co-principal investigators has demonstrated that children              readily process and make use of replies to their own speech and sign            utterances when the replies recast the child's meanings into related but        more complex sentence structures.  This effect has been seen in the             acquisition of sign language as well as spoken language.  It is                 hypothesized that similar acquisition processes and effects of input            components (such as recasts) are involved when children acquire new text        skills (such as reading and writing) and second language skills.  This          collaboration will combine studies of multiple sign languages (German,          Swedish and American) and reading and writing acquisition by children           whose first language may be any of these sign languages or a dominant or        minority spoken language in the corresponding countries.  Such diversity        of subjects will allow more rigorous testing of process assumptions than        could possibly be achieved by concentrating on American English in the          United States alone.  The collaboration will include close process              analyses of newly acquired skills through comprehension and reaction            time testing using microcomputers, in the various codes that are                accessible to any individual child.  Analyses of cross linguistic               similarities and differences at varied levels of code mastery will be           pursued.  The ongoing and prior work of the American investigators and          their European collaborators provide a rich foundation for exchange and         collaboration on these research topics.                                                                                                                         Cross-linguistic work is necessary before conclusions can be drawn about        the universality of language acquisition mechanisms.  Coordinated               research in the U.S., the FRG, and Sweden may lead to a considerable            expansion of the cross-language and cross-cultural validity of the              collaborators' work on the processes of acquiring multiple communication        codes.  Although the research is process oriented, rather rapid                 conversion of theoretical advances to advances in educational procedures        is expected in the areas of special education, second language learning,        and literacy skill training.  The use and refinement of research                techniques such as the computer-animated signs and graphics promises to         benefit other research teams that work with visual language stimuli.",
