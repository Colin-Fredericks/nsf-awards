 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project is on field investigations in the natural             sciences and the integration of various types of basic field data to            better understand the natural environment.  During a four week summer           session elementary and junior high teachers will engage in field                investigations supported by laboratory activities and lectures.  These          studies will be directed at the management issues of Idaho's public             lands and will include many presentations and field investigations lead         by scientists from both government agencies and private industry.                                                                                               As a part of the summer class the participants will make teaching               collections and investigate various methods of presenting such science          content in their classrooms.  Follow-up activities during the next              school year will emphasize incorporation of material from the project           into science teaching.  Each participant will prepare and pilot a               teaching unit on a topic related to their summer experiences and later          share it with their fellow teachers.  In addition, the project director         and master teachers will visit the classrooms of all participants, and          the participants will exchange classroom visitation in order to improve         their teaching methods.",
