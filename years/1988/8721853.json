 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is generally recognized that there is a profound interaction                 between emotion and cognition.  Emotional states, what we feel                  and the intensity behind what we feel, can enhance and impair                   judgment and performance; cognitions, what we think, typically                  play a major role in the generation and maintenance of emotional                states.  Nevertheless, relatively little is still known about the               specific way in which cognition affects emotions.  This research                will test new hypotheses about how cognitive processes trigger                  emotions and amplify their intensity.                                                                                                                           The goal of this research is to develop a systematic account of                 the way in which cognition contributes to emotion.  A subsidiary                goal is to determine the distinct emotions that such an account                 should cover.  Preliminary research will be aimed at classifying                different specific emotional states into those of the same                      emotion type.  Initial indications are that the result will be a                set of about twenty different emotion states, many of which have                large numbers of closely allied states associated with them.                    Experiments using these distinct emotion types will determine                   whether the conclusions of experiments already reported in the                  literature need qualification when the stimuli used are known to                represent genuine emotions.                                                                                                                                     Once these distinct emotion types are identified, they will be                  used for examining the influence of cognition on emotion.  A                    number of studies will examine this issue, most designed to test                specific hypotheses derived from a particular theory that                       specifies both the cognitive conditions necessary to elicit each                distinct emotion and the factors that make each emotion mild or                 intense (their intensity variables).  A number of experiments                   will study emotions and their intensity variables using several                 different methods, including the manipulation of information                    about characters in stories (hypothetical emotions), the                        assessment of reactions to recent personal experiences                          (retrospective emotions), and the direct induction of emotions                  through hypnosis, computer games, and televised sports events                   (concurrent emotions).                                                                                                                                          Though this research is basic and non-clinical in nature, it has                implications for clinical work with patients in which emotions                  impair people's functioning in the world.  It also has                          implications for such non-clinical issues as crowd control, for                 example, British soccer fans, and control of emotional input to                 important political decisions.",
