 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                    Organometallic Chemistry Program is metal-sulfur and                            metal-oxygen chemistry, with emphasis on the development of                     Group 5 metal-sulfur and manganese-oxygen chemistry. One                        objective is to explore the structures, physicochemical                         properties and reactivities of group 5 metal-sulfur compounds                   as a function of metal identity (V, Nb or Ta) and oxidation                     level. The ligands under study are thiolates and sulfide. Of                    especial interest is the synthesis of singly- or                                multiply-bonded metal clusters supported solely by sulfur-based                 ligation. A second objective is the synthesis of compounds of                   higher oxidation state (>II) compounds of manganese containing                  oxide bridges and with primarily carboxylate ligation. Also                     encompassed in this work is a search for higher and higher                      nuclearity species, which are expected to possess novel                         structural and magnetic properties, and be of relevance both to                 biological systems containing high nuclearity M/O aggregates                    and to the magnetic properties of single-domain magnetic oxide                  particles.                                                                                                                                                      Some of the new compounds which will be synthesized are                         expected to be improved models of such important                                metalloproteins as those which are involved in photosynthesis.                  Studies of the high nuclearity metal-oxygen complexes will                      provide a better understanding of the changes in magnetic                       behavior which accompany changes in particle size of such metal                 oxides as magnetite. Magnetic metal oxides are used in digital                  data storage.",
