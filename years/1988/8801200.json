 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work on this project will focus on topics in mathematical                  analysis connected with orthogonal polynomials.  There are two                  directions the work takes.  First one can begin with a measure on               the real line or unit circle and consider the corresponding                     orthogonal polynomials and their recurrence relations.                          Conversely, one may begin with a class of polynomials arising                   from a recurrence relation and ask for information about measures               against which they become orthogonal.  In this latter context,                  the existence of measures yielding the recurrence coefficients                  has been known for some time.  Work to be done here is that of                  determining the measure from the coefficients in a                              computationally efficient way.                                                       Another line of investigation will pursue the asymptotic                   behavior of the Christoffel function associated with a measure.                 Christoffel functions are related to statistical prediction                     theory.  They minimize polynomial integrals associated with                     families of orthogonal polynomials.  In addition, work will be                  done analyzing eigenvalues of infinite tri-diagonal matrices                    used in the study of Schrodinger equations in central force                     fields.  Specific goals include improving an inequality for the                 limits of Christoffel functions on the unit circle associated                   with measures of the Szego class and narrowing the gap between                  the theory of orthogonal polynomials and signal processing.                     Results are expected to play an increasing role in the processing               and transmission of electronic signals.",
