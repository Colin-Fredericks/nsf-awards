 "awd_abstract_narration": "John von Neumann is one of the major scientific figures of 20th                 century America.  He contributed to the mathematical disciplines                of logic, measurement theory, Lie groups, operator theory,                      mathematical physics, and numerical analysis.  He applied                       mathematics to the foundations of quantum mechanics, game theory,               economics, and automata.  He pioneered the early design,                        programming, construction, and scientific use of computers.  He                 served as a productive faculty member at eminent mathematical                   research institutions in Germany and the United States.  He                     participated at high levels in the mobilization of science during               World War II and was a major advocate for the development of                    atomic energy after the war.  In short, von Neumann played a                    central role in mathematical science in all of its ramifications                in the United States.  A study of his work promises greatly to                  elucidate the growth of the United States as a scientific power                 in this century.  Nowhere was his influence greater than in his                 contributions to the development of the modern computer.  It is                 this latter aspect of von Neumann's work that Dr. Aspray is                     studying.  Specifically, Dr. Aspray is examining von Neumann's                  work on the logical design of hardware systems, coding and                      programming, and the construction of modern computing equipment.                This work will complement Dr. Aspray's previous work on von                     Neumann's contributions to numerical analysis, scientific                       computation, and theory of computing.  Under this new project,                  Dr. Aspray will integrate the work of the two projects and set                  the general context in which von Neumann's work was carried out.                This work is based on an examination of published materials,                    archival materials, new and existing oral histories and                         conversations and correspondence with von Neumann's associates.",
