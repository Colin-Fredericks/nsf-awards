 "awd_abstract_narration": "The measurement and use of visual motion is a fundamental                  component of biological and machine vision systems that provides                essential sensory information for tasks such as navigation,                     object manipulation and recognition.  Significant advances have                 been made toward understanding how vision systems might solve the               individual problems of detecting sudden movements, segmenting the               scence into distinct objects on the basic of motion                             discontinuities, tracking objects of interest, recovering the                   three-dimensional structure and movement of object surfaces, and                inferring their own movement relative to the environment.  This                 research examines how solutions to these problems are integrated                into a motion analysis that performs these functions with speed,                accuracy, reliability and flexibility.  Such a system must embody               multiple computational strategies that combine fast and robust                  methods for deriving qualitative motion information with slower,                accurate methods for deriving quantitative models of three-                     dimensional structure and motion.  The approach taken in this                   project brings together theoretical analyses, implementation and                testing of computer algorithms, and observations on human motion                perception.  This research will lead both to significant                        improvements in the performance of computer vision systems at                   analyzing dynamic images, and new understanding of motion                       analysis in the human visual system.",
