Professor Anthony                  Atkinson of Imperial College, London will be in residence at                    the University of Minnesota in the Spring Quarter, 1989, and                    ten to twelve researchers from outside Minnesota will be                        invited to participate in an ongoing research colloquium, each                  visitor spending several days at Minnesota.  Support is                         available for these visitors, with a portion allocated for                      young Ph.D.'s and graduate students.  Several areas will be                     emphasized, including diagnostics for time series, for                          multivariate analysis, and for quality control.  Among the U.S.                 visitors who have agreed to participate are R. Carroll, N.                      Duan, D. Hinkley, W. Meeker, and T. Haste.  The activities are                  directed by Professor Sanford Weisberg of the Applied                           Statistics Department at the University of Minnesota.                                                                                                                Statistical diagnostics concerns methods used to examine                   assumptions made in the analysis of data and to choose between                  competing models.  Methods have been developed for many types                   of statistical models.",
