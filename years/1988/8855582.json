 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cognitive research indicates that science experts commonly use diagrams         as mediational tools for reasoning visually.  But in science education          materials and practices, visuals are typically \"aids\" rather than               fundamental representations.  This research will examine how students           learn to comprehend, use, and construct diagrams as thinking tools.  It         will focus on the diagram-dense field of beginning optics.  The project         has two interacting phases:  research on how students understand static         optics diagrams, and development and refinement of prototype computer-          based dynamic diagrams and diagramming tools.  Specific tasks are:  (1)         Pilot research, and analysis of diagrams in optics texts, (2) research          on  instructional practices with these diagrams, (3) research on student        understanding and use of diagrams, (4) design and develop interactive           diagrams and a dynamic diagram-construction kit, (5) carry out research         with prototypes, and (6) formulate and disseminate implications for             creation and use of interactive diagrams in science education.  Such            research on visual education in science will help guide development of          new curricula and software for science education.  The project team of          cognitive scientists, science educators, graphics specialists, and              systems developers is devoted to promoting learning and reasoning in            science with new data, theory, and innovative prototypes of dynamic             diagrams.  These interdisciplinary activities more directly link science        education research, materials development, and classroom activities.            Cost sharing is provided by the Institute for Research on Learning which        is contributing indirect costs and APPEL which is contributing four             MacIntosh II systems.",
