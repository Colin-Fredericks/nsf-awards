 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many mammals, including human beings, similar mechanisms                     regulate reproduction.  The purpose of Dr. Carter's research is                 to examine the role of social and endocrine factors in the                      regulation of male reproductive behavior.  Dr. Carter has                       selected a highly social, monogamous rodent, the prairie vole, as               a model system for analyzing the interaction of behavior and                    physiology as determinants of reproduction.  Voles are                          agricultural pests and are known for dramatic fluctuations in                   their population levels.                                                                                                                                        Dr. Carter will study prairie voles in the laboratory, and also                 in nature to validate her research findings under natural                       conditions.  Of particular interest in these animals is the                     finding that parents are capable of inhibiting the reproductive                 maturity of their offspring.  In addition, preliminary findings                 suggest that female voles can induce hormonal changes in their                  male partners.                                                                                                                                                  These studies will contribute to our knowledge of the role of                   behavior as a regulator of reproductive endocrinology and also                  will extend our understanding of the basic mechanisms through                   which hormones may act in the nervous system to influence                       behavior.  In addition, Dr. Carter's research will yield new                    information about the role of social factors in population                      regulation in mammals.  The results of these studies will                       contribute information of fundamental importance in medicine, the               neurosciences, and ecology, and may eventually enhance our                      knowledge of factors that inhibit reproduction in endangered                    species.",
