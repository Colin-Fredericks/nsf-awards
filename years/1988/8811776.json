 "awd_abstract_narration": "The gene abnormal oocyte (abo) is one of a cluster of                           maternal effect genes.  Its unusual phenotypes are moderated                    by specific regions in heterochromatin.  Analysis of the abo                    mutation has led to the suggestion that the gene may regulate                   aspects of heterochromatic function, heterochromatic                            structure, and the replication of heterochromatic sequences.                    Copies of the gene may also reside in the heterochromatic                       DNAs and be functional in contexts when other sequences are                     not.  Such times may include gamete and early embryo                            formation.  Analysis of the gene has rested on a single                         mutant allele.  Collection of new mutations has been                            difficult because the gene lies in a poorly saturated and                       studied region of the second chromosome, and because the                        existing hypomorph produces no visable phenotype when                           homozygous.  The proposal describes a new method of screening                   for mutations at the abo function, and the several approaches                   that will be taken to characterize new alleles.  The                            identification of new alleles will allow us to determine if                     the effects of abo are a general property of the gene's                         normal function, and to distinguish between several aspects                     of models which describe the process producing the known abo                    phenotypes.                                                                                                                                                     There are many genetic studies on the function and structure                    of euchromatic chromatin.  There are few studies or even                        possible approaches on the structure and function of                            heterochromatin, or that part of genomes which has been                         found to contain very few functional genes.  The abo mutation                   promises to allow approaches to be devised which could change                   that situation.  However, more alleles must first be found                      for the system to be optimal.",
