 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) is being acquired for          use in two areas of undergraduate instruction - structured laboratories         and independent undergraduate research projects.  Students at the               sophomore level are using the FTIR in microscale organic labs to                perform quantitative analyses of products and to demonstrate organic            reaction kinetics/mechanisms.  Students in the junior analytical                laboratory sequence are assembling a network of interfaced instruments          by combining the FTIR and its associated computer with a compatible             spectrofluorometer.  The students are using the FTIR to explore its             ability to quantitatively analyze samples in a variety of physical              states - aqueous solutions, dilute solutions, opaque solids, polymer            coatings, etc.  Students are using the networked spectrofluorometer to          characterize a polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon mixture with 3-                 dimensional fluoroscopy.  Students in the extensive undergraduate               research program are able to select from eight, FTIR-oriented research          projects that have been designed by five faculty members (3 inorganic,          3 analytical/ environmental, 1 organic, 1 polymer).                                                                                                             The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.",
