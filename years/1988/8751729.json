 "awd_abstract_narration": "By introducing teachers to an empirical approach to statistics, this            three-year project will facilitate the teaching of statistics in middle         and secondary schools.  A total of 150 teachers of mathematics, science,        and computer science will participate in a three-week summer workshop in        statistics and in follow-up activities during the academic year.                Evaluation will assess the project's success in introducing statistics          into the curriculum at the classroom and the district level.                                                                                                    The project builds upon inservice workshops that were funded by the             State of Illinois.  Although based upon a high-school level statistics          text (with accompanying software) that was written by the PI's, the             workshops will familiarize participants with a variety of approaches to         the teaching of statistics.  There will be one workshop for 30 teachers         in the first summer and two in each of the following two summers.  Each         of the five workshops will recruit from a particular region of the              United States, and teachers will participate in \"teams\" of 2-4 superior         teachers, depending on the size of the school.  Each team will also             include a supervisor or administrator, and must contain at least one            senior teacher.  The schools must agree to provide funds and other              support for introducing statistics into the curriculum.                                                                                                         Cost-sharing contributed by the university, the participants'                   schools, and the publisher amounts to 32% of the NSF award.",
