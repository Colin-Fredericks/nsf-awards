 "awd_abstract_narration": "The island of Luzon is bounded by a simple system of opposed                    subduction zones.  Contrasting slabs of \"oceanic\" Philippine Sea                and \"marginal\" South China Basin lithosphere are injected into                  the mantle, where they appear to impact distinctive imprints on                 magma sources.  This project will attempt to model subduction-                  induced source evolution through geochemical/isotopic study of                  post-Miocene lavas from calc-alkalic Bicol and Bataan volcanic                  lineaments, and the alkalic Taal-Banahaw group in southern                      Luzon.  Data for major and trace elements, and Be-10, Sr, Nd,                   Pb, H, and O isotopes will be used to contrast effects of                       subducting (sparse) pelagic sediment and MORB basement  with                    (voluminous) continental sediment and variable MORB                             \"transitional\" basement.  Thus it should be possible to asses                   the influence of subducted sial on the genesis of alkalic magma.                Several specific questions will be addressed including:                         1.  The long term history of the suprasubduction mantle: was                    this of the MORB, OIB, or sub-continental type?                                 2.  The nature of mantle metasomatism beneath the Bataan and                    Bicol arcs.                                                                     3.  The significance of accessory phase stabilities; do they                    compositionally buffer second-stage metasomatic melts?                          4.  The role of subduction-derived H2O.                                         The project will involve sampling twelve active or dormant                      volcanoes, and is coordinated with research by the Philippine                   Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS), and research                groups in West Germany and France.",
