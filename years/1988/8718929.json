 "awd_abstract_narration": "The actions of prolactin (PRL) are characterized by                        cellular differentiation and the changes of gene expression that                underlie that differentiation.  This research is directed                       toward understanding the induction of altered gene expression in                pigeon crop tissue by prolactin.  This model is especially useful               because the tissue organization and development is relatively simple,           and the changes prolactin induces are profound and rapid.                       Various molecular approaches are used.  Specific prolactin-induced              gene products have been identified by us through in vivo and in                 vitro protein synthesis, cloning, differential                                  hybridization, immunochemical probes, and hybridization with known              genes.  The mechanisms responsible for PRL-induced gene expression              will be the subject of the experiments described in this proposal.              Sequencing of the major PRL-inducible cDNAs from the crop will be               completed to examine possible relationships of these genes with genes           of known function.  These data will also be useful later in                     making predictions about sequences involved in the regulation of the            genes.  Nuclear run-off transcription assays and mRNA turnover                  measurements will be used to determine whether the regulation of PRL-           inducible mRNAs is primarily at a transcriptional or post-                      transcriptional level.  Based on data thus far it is expected that a            large part of the regulation will be post-transcriptional.  If so,              the biochemical nature of the factors responsible for controlling               PRL-inducible mRNA decay will be studied by reconstituting either               native or cloned PRL-inducible transcripts with cytosolic factors               from crop tissues.  Decay of the products will be measured by either            hybridization or electrophoresis of end-labelled transcripts.  If               transcription is the primary mechanism of PRL control, the genomic              structure of one or more of the PRL-inducible genes will be                     determined by Southern analysis, genomic cloning, S1 mapping and                sequencing.                                                                          The proposed experiments will provide an understanding of the              mechanisms and substrates of prolactin stimulation in the crop tissue           model, and will contribute to the general understanding of the                  mechanism of action of this important hormone.",
