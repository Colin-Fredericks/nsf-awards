 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this research is to investigate the molecules that                   mediate adhesion of growth cones to basal processes.  The                       procedures used will involve first raising monoclonal antibodies                against wing epithelial cells at the appropriate stage of                       development.  Next these antibodies will be screened for their                  ability to bind to antigens showing a graded distribution along                 the PD axis on exposed basal surfaces of epithelial cells.  These               antigens will represent candidates that could provide directional               cues for axonal guidance.  Finally, functional assays for the                   role of antigenic candidates in axonal pathfinding will be                      carried out in vitro with Fab fragments of antibodies.                                                                                                          The study of morphogenetic processes in Manduca can eventually be               extended to the molecular genetic level by using Manduca in                     tandem with its fellow holometabolous insect, Drosophila.  This                 research allies well with the Principal Investigator's long range               goals of defining morphogenesis, as it occurs in situ, at all                   levels of biological organization, ultimately leading to a                      description in molecular terms of cell-substratum and cell-cell                 interactions associated with morphogenesis.",
