 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Chakravarty proposes to study computational problems in the                 domain of VLSI testing.  He is especially concerned with the                    generation and compaction of test stimuli when the circuit is                   designed using design-for-testability rules, such as \"Scan-                     In/Scan-Out\", and Built-In Self-Test (BIST) design.  Four                       problems are considered:  test generation, random testing,                      compaction of test data, and on-chip test generation.  He                       addresses these problems using several fault models:  stuck-at,                 transistor stuck open, and feedback/non-feedback bridging faults.                                                                                               These problems are known to be NP-hard.  Random testing for                     transistor stuck-open and bridging faults motivates a number of                 such problems.  Dr. Chakravarty is investigating algorithms that                lead to exact and to approximate solutions for these problems.                  He is also studying NP-hard minimization problems motivated by                  the need for compacting test data, looking for approximation                    algorithms and investigating the technique of simulated annealing               to solve them.",
