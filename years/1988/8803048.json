 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this research program are:  1) To apply the                   effective continuum method recently developed by the PI to a host of            mass and heat transport processes involving two-phase media, and,               thereby, obtain theoretical expressions for the relevant effective              parameters; 2) To place this method, which is presently only ad hoc,            on a firmer theoretical foundation; 3) To develop a theory for                  determining the pair probability function in flowing systems and                thereby compute the dependence of these effective parameters on the             strength and structure of the impressed flow; and 4) To derive                  theoretical expressions for the shear induced particle diffusion                coefficient in flowing suspensions and for the enhancement of the mass          transfer rate in flowing liquids by the addition of inert solid                 particles.  These two effects, which play an important role in a wide           variety of physical and biological operations, can at present be                modeled only qualitatively.                                                                                                                                     Effective parameters are currently computed either via variational              techniques (which are generally inaccurate), exact calculations (which          are either very time consuming or very specialized), or approximate ad          hoc models containing adjustable factors which are often unreliable.            In contrast, the effective continuum method developed by the PI is              relatively simple and straightforward, is of great generality and               versatility, and, has been successfully tested against experimental             results.  This method also extends the applicability of the continuum           representation to systems where the micro and macro length scales are           of comparable magnitude.",
