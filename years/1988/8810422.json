 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several lines of research in atomic physics will be                        continued.  These include:  (1)  Collision and spectroscopy                     studies on low energy, multi-charged ions.  These ions will be                  confined in ion traps, or will be studied in the form of low                    energy beams from an ECR ion source.  Synchrotron radiation                     will be used for sequential photoionization of stored ions.                     (2)  Anisotropic excitation of ions, including the study of the                 production of oriented states by ion-surface grazing                            collisions, resulting in the emission of circularly polarized                   radiation, and the capture by low energy confined ions of                       electrons from spin-polarized hydrogen atoms.  (3)                              Spectroscopic studied including laser spectroscopy stored,                      metastable helium-like Be ions, and laser spectroscopy of                       certain ground state fine-structure transitions of highly-                      charged ions from the ECR source.  Synchrotron x-rays will be                   used to produce a cold, stored multi-charged ion gas, which has                 interesting properties, and serves as a target for the study of                 photoionization of ions as well as other research.",
