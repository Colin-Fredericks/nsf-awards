 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of water uptake and root cold hardiness at low                soil temperatures in four commercially important tree species                   (Abies amabilis, A. lasiocarpa, Pinus contorta and Tsuga                        mertensiana) from both the Pacific Coast and the Rocky Mountain                 regions will result in information with application in basic                    biology and woody plant physiology, as well as in applied                       biology.  Basic biological and physiological applications include               (1) an understanding of the tradeoff between maintenance of root                absorptive function at low soil-root temperatures versus the                    ability of the root to tolerate cold, subfreezing temperatures                  and how this tradeoff influences the success of species, normally               associated with continental and maritime climates, when found in                the opposite climatic regime, (2) the role of low soil                          temperatures in affecting productivity of mid and high elevation                woody plants and (3) an estimation of the relative importance of                belowground as opposed to aboveground processes in regulating                   plant/tree function.                                                                    This study will have applied application in the areas of                forest management and wilderness and parkland management.  Within               forest management, particularly given the mandates of various                   state and federal regulations (described under the appropriate                  Forest Practices Acts), this study will provide information                     useful to (1) site selection for regeneration, (2) microsite and                site constraints on regeneration and productivity, (3) an                       understanding of the role of stand development on altering site                 microclimate and the resultant impacts on tree mortality and (4)                the prediction of the impact of site and climate modification on                tree mortality.",
