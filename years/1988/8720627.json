 "awd_abstract_narration": "Honeycomb Hills, Utah, is a volcanic dome which is the product of               a single eruptive cycle froma a fluorine-rich silicic magma.  The               system is particularly amenable to study because it formed during               a single eruptive cycle within which there were developed                       significant systematic variations in volatile content, phenocryst               content, and mineral and whole rock chemical comppsition.                       Furthermore, the system has not been modified by subsequent                     volcanic activity.  The objective of this study is to establish                 the physical and chemical processes operating prior to and during               the eruption of this compositionally zoned, silicic magma body.                 The study will focus on the following problems:  1) How did the                 energetics of the eruption vary, and is it correlated with                      changes in volatile content or composition, or other                            physical/chemical heterogeneities?  2) How are the different                    volatile components distributed in the preeruptive magma body?                  3) What is the role of injection of mafic magma in to the system,               particularly as a source of heat and a potential eruption                       trigger? 4) How did the systematic compositional zonation                       develop?  This includes evaluation of evidence for volatile                     transfer of selected elements, evidence of limited magma mixing                 during eruption, and the role of fractionation of phenocryst                    phases. 5) What is the origin of high fluorine rhyolites and how                are they related to rare element pegmatites?",
