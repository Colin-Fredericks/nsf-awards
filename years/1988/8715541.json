 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interaction of alkali-metal promoters with supported rhodium                catalysts is studied using extended X-ray absorption fine                       structure (EXAFS).  By use of an in-situ EXAFS cell, it is                      possible to observe the nature and diversity of the alkali-metal                and transition-metal atoms both in the reduced catalysts and                    under reaction conditions.  These data are combined with results                of catalyst characterization by atomic absorption, X-ray                        diffraction, gas adsorption, infrared spectroscopy, and thermal                 desorption, as well as transient kinetic studies, on the same                   catalysts to define the bonding, electronic state, nearest                      neighbors, and local structure of both the promoter and the                     catalytic metal.                                                                                                                                                Chemical modification of catalysts by the addition of small                     quantities of a promoter can greatly affect catalyst activity and               selectivity.  Many fundamental questions about how promoters                    function remain unanswered, including where they are located on                 the surface, what relationship they have with the support, and                  what interactions they have with the reactants.  These questions                are addressed using a combination of EXAFS, transient kinetics,                 and more traditional techniques.  This could lead to a general                  theory of surface chemical promotion.",
