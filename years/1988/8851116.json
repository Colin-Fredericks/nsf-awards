 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a model for preparing science and mathematics         teachers for elementary school.  The model is comprehensive, beginning          with the students' first preservice courses through the first years of          teaching.  Project faculty will develop courses that integrate content,         learning theory, and teaching strategies.  Field experience and student         teaching will take place in the classroom of teachers whose philosophy          and pedagogy are consistent with project goals. A support network to            ease the transition time from preservice to inservice teaching will be          developed among school administrators, university faculty, educational          service personnel, lead and mentor teachers, and graduates of the               project.  This network will, at the same time, develop a broad base of          support for the project goals.  Such a network of committed people              involving so many levels of our educational institutions will insure the        continuation of the project goals.                                                                                                                              The project will have approximately 25% cost sharing from the                   institution.",
