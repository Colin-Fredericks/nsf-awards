 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project resides in the field of geotechnical                      engineering and groundwater resources.  The proposed problem                    addresses the efficiency of near surface aquitards (a relatively                impermeable layer comprised of glacial sill or alluvial silt) to                retard the entry of hydrocarbons into shallow confined aquifers.                The proposed effort involves the study of the pattern and                       parameters of immiscible (non-mixable) fluid flow near the                      interface between two strata with moderately dissimilar                         permeabilities (hydraulic conductivity).  A hydraulic gradient                  causing lateral flow is implanted in the lower, more permeable                  straturm.  the effects of relative permeability and varying                     artesian pressure on the movement of immisable fluids at strata                 interfaces and the resulting vertical distribution of the                       containment within the aquifer are the central focus of this                    investigation.  the subsurface environment will be modelled in a                clear rectangular container as a confined aquifer.  To simulated                localized contamination of the confined aquifer, the penetration                of an immiscible fluid (probably kerosene for safety reasons)                   will be permitted to penetrate a small area of the aquitard.                    This study will extend flow analysis to stratified subsurface                   environment subject to fluctuating flow pressures and velocities                which better approximates in-situ conditions.",
