 "awd_abstract_narration": "Unlike syntax and semantics, design is not an aspect of artificial              languages that has been amenable to formalization, although it is an            obvious candidate for such work.  Most studies of the design of formal          languages have been extremely informal, and could not be used to                develop tools for a language designer.  Even the more sophisticated,            semantics based, studies while insightful, treat the process of design          nebulously.  In many situations, ranging from summarizing natural               language database responses, to formalizing question and answer systems         a universe is given and the challenge is to find a way to communicate           information about aspects of the universe in an appropriate language.                                                                                           In previous research they have developed a formalization of language            design in which designs are expressible in steps.  In this work the PI          will investigate several crucial issues in the mathematics of the               system of design they have developed, and will continue an                      implementation of the language for design.  Sequoya is being                    implemented in C and Franz Lisp on a VAX 11/780 running under Berkley           UNIX 4.3 at the Univ of CA-San Diego.",
