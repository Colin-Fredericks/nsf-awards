It will theoretically and experimentally investigate                 oscillatory chemical reactions.                                                      Mechanistic investigations of a number of oscillatory                      systems will be performed.  These studies will employ both                      classical experimental methods and fast reaction techniques                     such as stopped-flow as well as extensive computer simulation.                  Rate laws and rate constants will be determined for several                     elementary processes that play important roles in these systems.                     Coupled chemical oscillators will also be investigated                     including those that arise when two oscillators interact either                 via mass flow or through common chemical species.                                    New computation methods will be used to explain the                        experimentally obtained results including the effects of                        stirring and mixing, the propagation of waves of chemical                       reaction under the influence of a gravitational field, the                      influence of electric fields on the propagation of chemical                     waves when ions play an important role in the chemistry of the                  reaction, and reactions in which the reaction time varies                       stochastically.",
