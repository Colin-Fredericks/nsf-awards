 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the summer of 1984, several scientists in atmospheric                    electricity and radar meteorology conducted a thunderstorm                      experiment near Langmuir Laboratory, New Mexico Institute of                    Mines and Technology which is located on a mountaintop near                     Socorro, New Mexico.  The objective of this experiment was to                   obtain a comprehensive data set of the electrical and                           microphysical properties of the thunderstorms formed near the                   mountaintop so that we could better understand thunderstorm                     electricity.                                                                         Under this award, Professor Ray will analyze the data                      collected by four Doppler radars: three surrounding the mountain                and one on the mountaintop.  The three-dimensional wind field to                be extracted from the radar data is essential to the                            understanding of the transport of charged particles within                      thunderstorms.",
