 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Symposium, under the sponsorship of the                               Institute of Mathematical Statistics, will be held                              August 16-20, 1988 at Colorado State University.  It is                         scheduled to coincide for two days with the Annual                              Meeting of the Institute for Mathematical Statistics                            which will also be held at Colorado State University.                           There will be three one-hour invited addresses, eleven                          special topical sessions, and contributed sessions.  The                        invited addressees will be given by D. Aldous, A. J.                            Baddeley, and K. Urbanik.  The eleven special sessions                          cover a wide range of topics.  The organizers are                               Professors R. Pyke of the University of Washington and                          R. Taylor of the University of Georgia. There is                                participant support available.                                                       Probability theory has developed into a mature                             discipline in its own right, as well as fostering new                           research developments in areas such as computer science                         and physics.  It has applications in areas of the                               physical sciences such as filtering, control and                                optimization, economics and finance modeling,                                   neurological models, and image processing.",
