 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Eric Herbst at Duke University is considered one of the                     founders and leading experts in the field of astrochemistry.  In                his current research effort, Dr. Herbst will continue a program of              theoretical modelling of dense interstellar clouds in which he                  will incorporate new constituent molecules and the effects of dust              grains.  Dr. Herbst will also try to understand in detail the                   individual gas phase processes that occur inside dense                          interstellar clouds.                                                                                                                                            Primarily through observations at radio wavelengths, observers                  have detected the presence of more than seventy different                       molecules in the vast regions of space that lie between the stars.              The existence of these molecules has stimulated a large research                effort directed towards understanding why the molecules are                     present and how they are produced.  The objective of Dr. Herbst's               theoretical research is to better understand the chemistry of this              aspect of the interstellar medium.",
