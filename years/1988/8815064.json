 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ocean Studies Board (OSB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS)         will convene a Workshop on Continental Margins in late 1988 to compare          the tectonics and evolution of active and passive continental margins.          The workshop will be divided into two parts.  The first will focus on           evolution of passive continental margins.  This section of the workshop         will consider mechanics of rifting of the lithosphere; magmatic proces-         ses associated with continental rifts and passive margins; sequences and        morphology of rifts and passive margins; and sedimentary deposition at          passive margins.                                                                                                                                                The second part will focus on active marginal processes and will address        convergent plate margin mechanics and evolution of active plate margin          crust and mantle.  The study of convergent plate margin mechanics will          consider displacements, seismicity, and deformation at convergent bound-        aries; mechanics of transform faults; subduction mechanics; and geometry        and deformation of accretionary wedges.  The study of evolution of ac-          tive plate margins will consider initiation of convergence; tectonic            evolution of intra-oceanic island arcs and back-arc basins; accreted            terrains; and fates of subducted materials.                                                                                                                     Eighty scientists will participate in the workshop with support from a          group of Federal agencies.  The deliberations of the workshop will be           summarized in a \"Proceedings\" report which will be widely ditributed to         the sponsoring agencies and the scientific community.",
