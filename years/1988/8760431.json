 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I                          project is in the general area of analytical and surface                        chemistry and in the subfield of mass spectrometry.  The                        goal of this research activity is to evaluate the organic                       microanalysis capability of laser ionization mass                               spectrometry (LIMS).  This technique, which is also                             referred to as  laser microprobe mass spectrometry, has                         been shown to provide useful organic microanalytical data                       for selected organic solids.  However, a systematic                             evaluation of this potentially unique chemical analysis                         capability has not been performed.  This Phase I research                       will determine the overall utility of the LIMS technique in                     organic solids analysis and could lead to the development                       of new LIMS protocols and instruments for this important                        type of analytical problem.                                                                                                                                     This Phase I project consists of four research tasks: (1)                       Acquiring a LIMS data base of representative organic solids                     at several analysis conditions; (2) Analyzing these mass                        spectra for structurally significant ion peaks; (3)                             Comparing, where possible, these LIMS data with those                           produced by more conventional mass spectrometric                                techniques; and (4) Applying, where appropriate, factor                         analysis techniques to identify or distinguish the mass                         spectra produced from different solid analytes.  This                           experimental strategy should provide the necessary                              information from which the general utility of LIMS organic                      microanalysis can be assessed.",
