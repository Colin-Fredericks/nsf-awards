 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research continues the principal investigator's time series                analysis of financial and macroeconomic data, the purpose of                    which is to evaluate simple theories of financial market behavior               and the relation of financial markets to the macroeconomy.                      Important new understandings of the behavior of financial markets               already have been achieved through improved models, new                         techniques of improving the fit of models, and through the use of               new econometric tools.                                                                                                                                          The proposed research addresses two distinct areas:  (l) Time                   series analysis of financial markets and the market for private                 homes.  (2) Survey analysis of individual and institutional                     investors.  In the first, time series modelling of cointegrated                 vector autoregressive models is used to explore further the                     behavior of financial markets and their relation to the                         macroeconomy.  In the second, questionaire surveys are used to                  learn about the fundamental patterns of human behavior in                       financial markets.  The investigator's research differs from most               other work in this field in that he is attempting to develop                    behavioral theories that do not rely on the conventional economic               assumption that all investors are rational.  The lines of inquiry               are complex, but there is a good chance for significant                         scientific as well as practical payoff.",
