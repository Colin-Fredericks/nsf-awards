 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in conjunction with                    Battelle Ocean Sciences will design, construct, test, and                       evaluate a new integrated, in-situ, sea water sampler and data                  collecting system.  Design criteria calls for the ability to                    collect at least 36 discrete water samples, of up to 10 liters                  each, from ocean depths down to 6,000 meters in significantly                   less time than now required.  Water sample integrity will be                    maintained without chemical contamination from component parts                  during all phases of operation from collection through transfer                 to storage containers or to shipboard analytical instruments.                   Provision will also be made for the integration of certain                      commercially available instruments.                                                                                                                             Sample containers will positively seal to prevent contamination                 from outside or loss of gases from the sample prior to                          transfer.  A deck unit will control the sample collection                       mechanism of the underwater unit.  A handling system will be                    supplied that will allow the deployment and recovery of the                     underwater unit, including attachments.  Secure stowage of the                  underwater unit on deck between deployments will be integral to                 the handling system.  The handling and stowage system shall be                  designed as an integral part of the sampling system and shall                   be transportable for use on a variety of oceanographic vessels.                                                                                                 The extensive hydrographic survey plans and scientific goals of                 upcoming projects necessitate development of a new sampler with                 improved capabilities.  Improvements over present samplers will                 be realized in terms of the efficiency and reliability of                       sample and data collection.",
