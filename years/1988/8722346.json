 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference is timely.  A group of experts will take a                 careful look at the effects of predicted climate change on                      diversity of organisms.  There is scientific concensus that the                 Earth is warming because of the \"greenhouse effect.\"  While                     considerable effort has gone into projecting future climate                     change, relatively little attention has been devoted to assessing               potential effects on wild plants and animals.  Yet, initial                     studies have concluded that biological effects could be profound,               including large shifts in species ranges, disruption of                         biological communities, and extinction of species.  Conservation                responses to this problem will need a firm scientific                           understanding of how wild species will respond to the warming and               how these responses will interplay with continuing human                        encroachment.                                                                        The World Wildlife Fund will convene the first major                       symposium to assess affects upon biodiversity.  The conference                  will provide a scientific overview of current understanding,                    catalyze discussion and research, and educate both the scientific               and policy communities.                                                              Climatologists will present a range of climatic scenarios                  upon which life scientists will base papers discussing possible                 physiological and ecological responses.  The papers will be                     presented in plenary session and will be published by an academic               press.",
