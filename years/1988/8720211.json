The symposium theme is concerned with short- and          long-term changes in ecosystem and community structure and function             caused by natural and man-induced factors.  Specific consideration to           natural factors that induce change such as climate change, volcanic             activity and exposure of land by ice retreat will be considered in the          symposium.  Insight into the ecological processes that occur in                 changing environments is particularly important in the development of           monitoring programs for sound conservation policies.  The SCAR biology          symposia are the only conferences of their kind and occur at intervals          of about six years.  This group travel award will allow for attendance          by United States scientists and is consistent with U.S. policy in the           Antarctic in the maintaining of an influential research presence in             Antarctic affairs.",
