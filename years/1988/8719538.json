 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program                         supports research in inorganic photochemistry.  This research                   provides a fundamental basis for practical applications in the                  design of solar concentrators, photolithography and the                         treatment of certain diseases.  Moreover, excited state species                 are being investigated in regard to various energy conversion                   and fuel formation schemes.                                                                                                                                     This work will delineate factors influencing associative                        phenomena of excited-state coordination compounds.  In                          particular the influence of donor strength on exciplex                          quenching and the role of donor/acceptor interactions in                        directing electron-transfer and energy-transfer reactions of                    charge-transfer (CT) states will be described in detail.                        Associative photosubstitution processes will also be studied.                   At the time same time new excited state reagents will be                        developed and characterized including water-soluble copper(I)                   complexes, copper(I) systems with high energy excited states,                   polynuclear systems, and photooxidizing ligand-to-metal CT                      states.  Another objective will be to determine the influence                   of charge and substituent effects on copper phenanthrolines as                  \"footprinting\" reagents for DNA.  Finally, the research will                    lead to effective photosensitizers based on conformationally                    constrained terpyridine ligands, and it will reveal how ligand                  substituents affect localization of CT states on particular                     ligands in mixed-ligand complexes.                                                                                                                              The methods used will include steady-state photolysis,                          absorption and emission spectroscopies and                                      temperature-dependent lifetime studies.  A new technique for                    simultaneous determination of reaction quantum yields and                       product spectra will also be elaborated.  This research should                  contribute significantly to our understanding of the energies,                  the reactivities, and the lifetimes of excited-state transition                 metal complexes.  It should result in the development of new                    DNA structure probes and potentially useful photo-induced                       nuclease activity.",
