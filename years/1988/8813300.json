 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Toolik Field Station, located on Alaska's north slope in               the foothills of the Brooks Range, provides access to unique                    artic terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems.  Since 1975 it has                 provided logistic scientific support for scientists from                        throughout the United States.  Passage of the Artic Research and                Policy Act and the establishment of the Artic Long-Term                         Ecological Reserve Program have increased the Station's                         importance as a national research site.  Since 1982 there has                   been a constant increase in its seasonal use.  This request will                provide funds for upgrading of living facilities, purchase of                   scientific equipment, upgrading of the electrical system to meet                code, soudproofing of the generators and purchasing of                          snowmachines.",
