 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry provides                     support for the research of Dr. Vernon Parker, Utah State                       University. The work consists of a systematic study of the                      reactions and reactivity of organic anion radicals, dianions,                   cation radicals, and dications. Such reactive organic species                   are important intermediates in a wide variety of organic                        reactions and an understanding of their behavior has important                  practical signficance, particularly for electrode processes and                 polymerization reactions.                                                                                                                                       Using quantitative electrochemical methods, a number of                         reaction types will be studied including (i) reactions of                       cationic intermediates with nucleophiles, both neutral and                      anionic, (ii) proton transfer reactions of cation radicals and                  dications derived from methylarenes, and  (iii) protonation                     reactions of anion radicals and dianions.  Specific issues                      which will be addressed are (i) the intrinsic reactivity of ion                 radicals as compared to the corresponding doubly charged ions                   and (ii) the factors contributing to the rates of proton                        transfer to and from carbon of super acidic (basic) ion                         radicals and doubly charged ions.  These will provide                           fundamental new knowledge of importance to reactive                             intermediate chemistry.",
