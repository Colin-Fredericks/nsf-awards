 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is devoted to the pre-planning and organization of                 the first of two major meetings on the establishment of global                  digital map data bases.  At the first, representatives of all                   identified existing and planned global digital data bases will be               invited to address the status of existing efforts, the need for                 global data bases and the decisionmaking context which has to be                served.  Attention also will be focussed on the questions to be                 solved by their use, the desirable data structures, the potential               contribution of (next-decade) computer hardware and concepts of                 artifical intelligence to data structures and the desirable                     degrees of topological coding, the contradictions in map series                 data used as a base, their cost, management, access policy,                     degree of integration and reliability.  The way in which earth                  observations are eventually stored and able to be integrated will               effectively determine the degree to which global spatial                        processes can be understood.                                                                                                                                    Systematic review papers of potential problem areas will be                     commissioned for the first meeting to be held in England in the                 Spring of 1988.  Working groups will be established thereafter to               study areas of identified concern in preparation for the second                 meeting in Washington, D.C., now tentatively scheduled for 1990.                The meetings are under the auspicies of the International                       Geographical Union (IGU) and are part of the International                      Geosphere-Biosphere program.",
