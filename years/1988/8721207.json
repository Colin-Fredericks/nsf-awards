 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to use space-time behavior of seismicity to obtain           an improved model of Mt. St. Augustine's plumbing sytem and to                  infer the magma migration processes associated with its 1986                    eruption.  The ability to accurately determine hypocentral                      parameters would be achieved by using a) a realistic two-                       dimensional model of the volcano's seismic velocity structure                   and b) both travel time and amplitude data of seismic waves                     recorded at seismic stations on the volcano.  Preliminary results               using data from an eruption in 1976 indicate that amplitude data                from forward modeling based on the Gaussian beam method might                   provide a powerful means of constraining focal depth.  The                      potential of that method for volcano seismology requires detailed               exploration, which we propose to conduct in this investigation.                 Magma movement up the conduit of a central stratovolcano always                 produces microearthquake activity due to fracture propagation,                  dike emplacement, brecciation of host rocks and eventually vent                 excavation.  Precise location (especially of depth) of precursor                earthquakes prior to eruptions can give important clues about                   the evolution of the physical/chemical instability in the magma                 reservoir that eventually erupts.  If we succeed in developing                  an earthquake location scheme that is highly sensitive to depth                 of focus it could have an important application for eruption                    prediction.",
