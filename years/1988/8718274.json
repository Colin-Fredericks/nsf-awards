 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will test a model of B cell triggering in                    which early biochemical events that follow crosslinking of                      surface immunoglobulin antigen receptors are on parallel pathways               that lead to common mitogenic signals.  The model derives from                  preliminary observations in this laboratory that the elevation of               intracellular free calcium in response to receptor crosslinking                 appears to be composed of two separately triggered and separately               inhibitable responses.  The first goal of this research will be a               more detailed characterization of the two calcium signals with                  respect to requirements for triggering and inhibition, in order                 to establish firmly whether they are on independent signal                      pathways.  The second goal is to measure the calcium responses in               cells which have been triggered by antigen and compare them with                the responses elicited by the anti-immunoglobulin which is used                 to mimic antigen in the model system.  In order to overcome                     problems associated with the infrequency of antigen-binding                     cells, a magnetic cell sorting procedure will be used to enrich                 the antigen-binding fraction, and a fluorescence microscope                     system will be used to study responses in single cells.                              The mechanism by which antigen activates resting B                         lymphocytes remains an important gap in our fundamental                         understanding of the initiation of an immune response.  The                     innovative techniques for separation of antigen responsive                      resting B cells developed in this laboratory with previous NSF                  support provide the basis for the proposed further studies on                   this important problem.",
