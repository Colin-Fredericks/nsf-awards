 "awd_abstract_narration": "Steroid hormones produced by the testes or ovaries act on                  vertebrate brains to influence a host of processes ranging from                 sexual behavior to non-reproductive functions such as feeding,                  drinking, learning and memory.  Progress in unraveling the neural               mechanisms that mediate these steroid influences has been made in               only a few animal models.  It is difficult to identify cellular                 mechanisms by which sex steroids influence functions such as male               sexual and aggressive behaviors, which respond slowly to changes                in gonadal hormone levels.  Dr. Geert DeVries is studying                       dramatic changes in vasopressin pathways in the brain which have                a similar time course to that found in the male sex behavior.                   Studying the nature of these changes and their relationship to                  hormonally dependent functions such as male sexual behavior will                help to understand the neural basis of slow changes in behavior.",
