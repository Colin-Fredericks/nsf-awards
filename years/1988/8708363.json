 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term objective of this study is to derive general                 principles for the functioning of local circuit neurons,                        especially those cells which have synaptic output from their                    integrating regions (e.g., dendro-dendritic synapses) and which                 may use graded synaptic transmission below the threshold for                    spikes.  The immediate objective is to understand the functioning               of an invertebrate system, the stomatogastric ganglion of the                   crab Cancer borealis.  The focus of this study will be                          experiments designed to elucidate the role of calcium in                        stomatogastric cell function.  Questions will include:  1) When                 is voltage-dependent calcium influx due mostly to graded voltage                changes ( the pyloric rhythm) and when is it due mostly to                      spikes?  Does calcium influx vary with the cell type, the                       location within the neuron, or with synaptic or neuro-modulator                 activity?  2) How do neuromodulators affect the resting internal                calcium concentration and the voltage-dependent calcium influx in               different regions of identified cells?  3) What is the                          electrotonic organization of stomatogastric neurons and how is it               influenced by active conductances, neuromodulators, and  synaptic               inputs?  Methods to be used in this study include:  intracellular               somatic and neuropil recording, simultaneous measurements of                    internal calcium fluctuations in different regions of single                    photodiode array, and measurements of resting internal calcium                  concentrations with Fura 2 and CCD cameras.  Of necessity, most                 studies of neuron function have been constrained spatially:                     intracellular electrodes are placed in only one or two                          simultaneous locations in single cells, typically the soma.  This               entire neuron during its normal range of behaviors as it uses                   what might be considered its most interesting ion, calcium.",
