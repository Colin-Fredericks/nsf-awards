Metal vapor and conventional                     synthetic methodology will be employed to prepare fluorocarbon                  complexes of early transition metals. Trapping of metallic and                  molecular clusters will be accomplished by solvation and/or                     ligand injection during cluster growth in low temperature                       solvents. Further elucidation of bimetallic solvated metal atom                 dispersed (SMAD) catalysts will be carried out using structure                  sensitive reaction chemistry coupled with spectroscopic probes,                 especially EXAFS, Mossbauer and XPS techniques. In order to                     develop the highly reactive synthon CS to its full potential,                   attempts will be made to synthesize precursors which evolve CS                  at relatively elevated temperatures.                                                                                                                            Several of the substances under study in this project have                      potential for industrial applications. Of particular interest                   in this connection are the metal atom clusters of                               carefully-controlled size and the highly reactive SMAD                          catalysts.",
