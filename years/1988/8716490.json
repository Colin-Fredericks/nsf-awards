 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pT181 contains a cis-acting                   sequence element, cmp (for competition), whose deletion impairs                 the plasmid's ability to coexist with an incompatible plasmid.                  The element, which is external to the minimal plasmid replicon,                 affects the ability of the plasmid's origin of replication to                   utilize the plasmid-encoded initiator protein.  The goal of this                study is to understand the molecular mechanism by which cmp                     affects the site-specific interaction between ori and RepC over a               distance.  Structural requirements for cmp will be elucidated in                terms of minimal sequence, DNA bending and distance from ori.                   Comparative studies with cmp-like elements in other plasmids will               define common structural and functional features.  These studies                will be carried out by using an in vivo assay for the Cmp                       phenotype using plasmids having progressive deletions of the cmp                region, having cmp located at various distances from the origin,                or having the pT181 cmp replaced by cmp-like elements from other                plasmids.  Cmp plasmids have a lower titratable negative                        supercoiling than Cmp+ plasmids.  The nature of the linking                     difference associated with cmp will be studied by assaying levels               of superhelical tension in vivo in cmp+ and cmp plasmids by means               of a supercoiling-sensitive promoter.  The contribution of other                plasmid elements to cmp-associated supercoiling will be examined                by determining the linking difference between non-pT181 plasmids                carrying pT181 cmp and/or ori in the presence/absence of RepC.                  The possibility of interactions between cmp and other plasmid                   elements and between cmp and host factor(s) will be investigated                by isolation and characterization of plasmid-and host-linked                    mutations that suppress the Cmp phenotype.  A knowledge of cmp                  structure and function will provide the first evidence for the                  participation of enchancer-like elements in DNA replication.                    This study will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms               by which auxiliary factors and DNA elements govern site-specific                interactions between proteins and DNA.",
