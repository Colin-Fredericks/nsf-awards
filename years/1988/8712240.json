 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is continuing work on cross-linguistic generalizations                and principles of historical syntactic change based on research                 in three Eurasian language families: Finno-Ugric, Indo-European,                and Caucasian; and three Mesoamerican families: Mayan, Uto-                     Aztecan, and Mixe-Zoquean.  Specific goals are 1)                               characterization of syntactic evolution (mechanisms of change,                  implementation of change, concomitant change in other parts of                  the grammar), 2) statement of formal constraints on syntactic                   change, 3) determination of what sort of syntactic changes are                  possible, 4) explanation of change, and 5) relation of the                      current work to various competing theories of grammar.                                                                                                               This project has already generated nearly a dozen                          publications and an even larger number of public presentations,                 and the investigators are now at work on a major volume which                   will contain a comprehensive treatment of diachronic syntactic                  change.  This work will meet a basic need in linguistics, where                 there is only one other treatment of the topic, published six                   years ago and of more limited scope.  Both investigators are                    accorded profound respect from their colleagues, in particular                  for the clarity of their presentation of data and of their                      argumentation.",
