 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the leadership of the Connecticut Business & Industry Association         (CBIA), the Hartford Alliance has been established to strengthen K-12           science, mathematics, and technology education in the Hartford Public           Schools.   The Alliance is a unique private-public sector partnership           seeking to enhance teachers' knowledge and skills in science,                   mathematics, and computer literacy and provide enrichment for urban             minority youth.  The Hartford Alliance currently includes CBIA, the             Travelers Companies, IBM, Aetna Life and Casualty, the Hartford Public          Schools, Wesleyan University, Central Connecticut State University, the         University of Hartford, St. Joseph College, the Science Museum of               Connecticut, and Choate-Rosemary Hall.                                                                                                                          Collaborative programs to improve teaching will be conducted and                coordinated through the Alliance.  Building on successful statewide             models, professional development activities will be provided for at             least 180 Hartford teachers.  Roughly 35 percent of all 3-6th grade             teachers, 50 percent of middle-school science and math teachers, and 25         percent of high-school science and math teachers will be served.                Additionally, approximately 750-1000 students will directly participate         in enrichment programs collaborating with the Alliance.                                                                                                         By 1989, the Alliance will bring together all private sector                    math/science partnerships currently operating in Hartford.                      Because there has been no organizational framework in place for                 coordinating these efforts, neither the school administration nor the           companies involved know the full range of programs offered, who they            serve or miss, just how effective they are, or how they interrelate.  To        address this problem, CBIA and the Hartford Alliance Executive Committee        will be responsible for: 1) gathering and disseminating information             about all existing math/science partnership programs in Hartford;  2)           coordinating these efforts with the Hartford Public Schools; 3)                 identifying overlapping services, potential areas for collaboration             among programs, and unmet needs; 4) encouraging the development of new          partnerships to respond to those needs;  5) evaluating the short- and           long-term impact and effectiveness of these partnerships; and 6)                disseminating information about the Alliance process and its programs           locally, statewide, and nationally.                                                                                                                             Cost sharing by the partners will total 111% of the NSF funding.",
