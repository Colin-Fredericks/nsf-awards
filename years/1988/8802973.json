 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) proposes the establishment            of a Center for Materials Science.  Researchers at the Center will              form Multidisciplinary teams to study:  (a) The Corrosive Wear of               Iron, Nickel, and Chromium Alloys; (b) The Chemistry of Nonplanar               Aromatics; and (c) Silicon Transition Metal Materials and Complexes.            Each team will conduct research on the chemistry and physics of                 materials.  The studies will include investigations of phenomena and            structures in surfaces, interfaces between different media, and                 developing atomic-level models of fracture and other modes of metallic          failure.  The Center will also be used to motivate minority students            at all educational levels to consider careers in science and                    engineering.  In addition, the Center will develop strategies to                strengthen partnerships with industry and other major research                  institutions.                                                                                                                                                   This project meets the major goal of the Minority Research Centers of           Excellence (MRCE) program:  to increase the minority presence in                science and engineering by making substantial resources available to            upgrade the research capabilities of the most productive minority               institutions.  The project will at the same time enable this                    institution to use research as a tool to increase the effectiveness of          related science and engineering activities for minority groups in its           region.  The Center will accomplish this by providing opportunities             for faculty and students at UTEP and other nearby institutions with             sizable minority student enrollments to engage in meritorious research          that leads to publications in refereed journals.",
