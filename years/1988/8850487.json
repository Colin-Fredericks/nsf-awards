 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is an extension of analysis of data from the                 Second International Science Study (SISS).  SISS is an                          international survey of 24 countries conducted in 1983.  THe                    survey was repeated in the U.S. in 1986 because of poor                         participation rates of schools in the 1983 effort.  Later                       analysis of the SISS data resulted in the report \"Science                       Achievement in Seventeen Countries\", which has received a great                 deal of attention, mainly because of the relatively poor                        performance of U.S. students in science achievement.                                 Under this grant, in-depth analyses will be conducted on the               factors that explain science achievement in the various                         countries.  Some of these factors involve the science curriculum,               its structure (integrated vs. layer-cake approach), and the                     opportunity to learn and an estimate of how much can be learned                 by certain age levels, even by the bottom 25 percent of students.               Some of the effect that this and the amount of homework has on                  achievement and in-service training, involvement in science                     projects, the planning of lessons and the relative salaries of                  teachers will be examined.  An the effect of yet other variables                to do with school organization such as school and class size will               be examined.                                                                         The report from this project/scheduled for June, 1989 should               result in important international analyses of student achievement               in science that will be useful to science educators and others in               advocating changes designed to improve science instruction and                  teaching.                                                                            This project is being supported jointly by the National                    Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Education.",
