 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is a theoretical investigation into               the causes of genetic variation in natural populations and the                  changes that occur in this variation as a result of natural                     selection.  Genetic variation is measured at many different                     levels, ranging from DNA at the lowest level to the overall                     morphology of the organisms at the highest.  At each of these                   levels there is a substantial amount of genetic variation,                      although the forces that are responsible for this variation                     remain a mystery.  It is the intent of the proposed research to                 investigate the relative roles that natural selection, mutation,                and genetic drift might play in the maintenance of genetic                      variation in natural populations.  Unique to this research is the               hope that a comprehensive theory will emerge that allows the                    variation at all levels to be explained within the context of a                 single theory, rather than the current state where a different                  theory is used for each level of variation.   Evolution not only                maintains variation, but it also changes the genetic state of a                 population.  The most familiar expression of this is the changes                in morphology seen in the fossil record.  A second goal of this                 research is to provide a theory to explain these changes in                     morphology that is compatible with our understanding of genetics                and the forces that maintain variation.                                                 The proposed research will not only provide insights into               the genetic bases of evolution in natural populations, but may                  also help to understand some of the problems facing human                       populations.  Humans share with other organisms the property of                 having an extraordinary amount of genetic variation between                     individuals.  This variation is undoubtedly at the root of some                 of the differences that are observed between individuals in such                important attributes as disease susceptibility.  Yet we are as                  ignorant of the cases of variation in human populations as we are               of the variation in natural populations.  The insights gained                   from this research will hopefully provide a better understanding                of the role of genetic variation in the human condition.",
