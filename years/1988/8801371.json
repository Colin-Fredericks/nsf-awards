 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shoshichi Kobayashi will continiue his work on the geometry                of holomorphic vector bundles. This is a topic of great interest                in differential geometry, algebraic geometry and mathematical                   physics. The recent work on the classification of four                          dimensional manifolds has provided a marvellous example of the                  surprising interplay between different mathematical disciplines.                Kobayashi's research is central to many of these exciting                       developments. A new aspect to his work is his development of a                  theory of infinite dimensional manifolds. This should prove to                  have applications to loop manifolds and therefore have                          implications in string theory.                                                       The first of Koabayashi's areas of research will be the                    moduli space of Einstein-Hermitian vector bundles. This involves                the study of self-dual connections on these bundles. These are                  known to be minimizing for the Yang-Mills functional. He will                   attempt to study a combined moduli space comprising moduli of                   bundles with moduli of complex structures on the base manifold.                 The second area will continue his work on applications of                       hyperbolic complex analysis to complex analytic varieties with                  singularities. It is very likely that this will have applications               in diophantine geometry. The final area of study will be the set                of mappings from one manifold to another, this is itself an                     infinite dimensional manifold with a rich structure. This topic                 is particularly important at this time in view of the growth of                 interest in string theory.",
