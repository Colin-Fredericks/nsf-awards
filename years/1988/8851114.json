 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to examine how people develop, construct,           interpret, and represent concepts of central tendency, or average.  From        this understanding, more effective directions for the teaching and              learning of statistics at the elementary and middle school levels will          be derived.  Given the major educational thrust toward statistical              literacy for all, and given the clear lack of research on what children         understand about statistics, this study represents an important step in         linking research to emerging mathematics teaching practices.                                                                                                    During the first year of the project, fourth, sixth, and eighth graders         as well as teachers of these grades will be interviewed to determine how        they find and interpret average.  Participants will use a variety of            materials to solve and represent problems involving  engaging, familiar         quantitative data.  Analysis of these interviews will identify the              concepts, approaches, misconceptions, representations, and rules                exhibited by individuals at these ages.  A theoretical model of                 conceptions  of average will be constructed from the first year's               analysis.  Based on this model, a series of teaching interviews, using          concrete and software-based representations, will be devised.  The              second year's research will focus on investigating how inadequate               cognitive models of average can become more complete and flexible.",
