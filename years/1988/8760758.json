 "awd_abstract_narration": "Narrative: An assessment is proposed of continuous, high-g                      centrifugation for production purification of medical proteins is               being studied.  Proteins are separated today in ultra-                          centrifuges, but not continuously and the method has not been                   scaled up.  The specific objectives are to assess: separation                   selectivity and throughput rate; possible biological damage to                  the protein by shear, by sedimentation, and by intense                          centrifugal force.                                                                                                                                              The focus of the analysis is on internal flows in the rotating                  fluid and their impact on sedimentation and separation                          selectivity.  The focus of the experiments is on the protein.                   Research on the hardware is reserved for phase II.                                                                                                              If continuous centrifugal purification is feasible, a new method                of downstream processing will become available to the                           biotechnology industry.  Because downstream processing now                      represents 70-80 percent of the product cost, centrifugal                       separation could lower significantly the cost to the patient of                 new drugs.",
