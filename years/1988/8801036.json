The objectives are i) to update to 1985 and                     expand to more than 1000 companies the linked NSF/Census R&D                    company-level data base and the Census Longitudinal Establishment               Data (LED) file which contains information on the output and                    inputs of manufacturing plants, and ii) to conduct an economic                  study on the effect of R&D investment on manufacturing produc-                  tivity using the linked R&D/LED data and various other industry-                level data files.  Among the topics studied will be the relation-               ship between R&D activity and size of company, R&D activity and                 changes in plant ownership (e.g., as a result of mergers and                    acquisitions), the effect of total R&D versus basic research on                 productivity, and the measurement of returns to company-funded                  versus Federally-funded R&D.                                                            The project will provide statistical data and the linking               mechanism that can be used in analyzing the relationship between                R&D funding and other economic variables.  The results should                   provide further understanding of the role of industrial R&D                     activities in promoting national economic growth and competitive-               ness, and thereby contribute to the Foundation's responsibility                 to provide a source of information for policy formulation in the                area of science and technology.",
