The objective                          of this research is to increase our understanding of                            how the loss of energy of the ion beam (represented in                          a displacement cascade (DC) of target atoms) to the                             target crystal affects reactions on the scale of three                          to ten lattice constants; the investigators will also                           study how these reactions, are in turn affected by                              ambient temperature.  By modifying ambient temperature                          and incoming ion energy and flux, and analyzing the                             results, information about micro-chemical reactions                             relevant to larger-scale systems, such as concentrated                          alloys, may be obtained.                                                                                                                                        The researchers will carry out this study, using the                            atom-probe field-ion microscope (APFIM), largely                                developed by the U.S. investigator at Northwestern                              University.  This instrument will permit the                                    non-destructive measurement of the chemistry of                                 individual DC's, created at the surfaces of special                             test structures.  Results will be analyzed with the                             French collaborator, who is a leading theoretician in                           the area of the modelling of micro-chemical                                     reactions.   The results of this research could have                            impact in the field of metallurgy, in which highly                              concentrated alloys can be formulated with unique                               properties.",
