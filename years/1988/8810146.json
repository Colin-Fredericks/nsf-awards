 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to establish a theoretical               basis for the creation of a spherical wrist stepper motor capable               of three degrees of orientation motion in a single joint.  The                  ball-joint-like spherical wrist motor is characterized by its                   simplicity in structure, compact design and free from                           singularities in the middle of the workspace except at the                      boundaries and unbalanced rotor centrifugal forces.  The                        spherical wrist stepper motor has significant applications where                the end-effector is required to orient quickly, continuously and                isotropically in all directions such as high speed plasma and                   laser cutting.  The research will focus on three areas.  The                    first is the prediction of the magnetic fields and reluctance                   forces for a given design using finite element technique, which                 will also provide a good understanding of the influences of the                 design parameters, on the torque and resolution.  The second is                 an optimization using non-linear programming techniques to                      maximize torque while minimizing weight and volume for                          a specified resolution.  The third area is the development of a                 two-level control scheme to pre-plan an optimum trajectory and to               develop an orientation control law with good disturbance                        rejection.",
