 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study the timing of global events such          as eustatic changes in sea level, extraterrestrial impact events, deep          sea hiatuses, changes in stable isotope compositions of sea water,              intervals of rapid faunal turnover in the stratigraphy of the middle            Eocene to lower Oligocene (Claibornian to lower Vicksburgian) of the            Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Province.  A chronostratigraphic framework            model based on the Graphic Correlation technique and calibrated to time         has been developed by the principal investigator.  It will be used to           make long distance and regional correlations of rocks, biozones,                sequence stratigraphic units, and determine the age of regional and             global events, and measure durations and rates.  In the interval near           the Eocene-Oligocene boundary the stable isotope compositions of three          kinds of microfossils (benthic and planktic foraminifers and                    ostracodes) will be examined to see how curves developed with these             data compare to those from the open ocean.  This stratigraphic interval         will also be studied in detail for magnetopolarity reversals.  The              predictive value of the chronostratigraphic model is used to indicate           stratigraphic intervals where microtektite and other microspherules             might be found.  These will be sampled and the microspherules studied           for mineralogy and chemical composition.                                                                                                                        This research will provide insight into the role of extraterrestrial            impacts on the evolution of life.",
