 "awd_abstract_narration": "Calcium and proton uptake at the alkaline surfaces of characean algae           will  be investigated.  Two competing models will be tested:  the               \"electronic\" model and the electroneutral one.  Various methods will be         used to distinguish between these models.  Pericellular ion and                 electrical fluxes will be estimated from chemical and electrical                gradients.  The uptake and translocation of calcium and carbon will be          measured using split chamber and radioisotope experiments.  Cytochemical        localization of calcium ATPase will be attempted.  The molecular form of        carbon transport toward the site of calcification will be investigated          by examining the fractionation of stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen          between precipitated calcium carbonate and solution.                                                                                                            The study has implications with regard to bicarbonate utilization in            aquatic systems, membrane electrophysiology, calcium transport through          cells and across membranes, and the mechanisms of calcification in              plants and animals.  Because bicarbonate is concentrated by some algae          and used as a carbon source for photosynthesis, this project also is            likely to add to our understanding of this important life process.",
