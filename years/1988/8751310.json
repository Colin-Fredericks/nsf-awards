Topics in advanced           mathematics that are closely related to modern research results are             expounded by world renown mathematicians in a companion project for the         high school students and which is funded from outside sources. The              teacher participants attend the lectures and discussion groups and learn        about the mathematical topics as well as approaches that they could use         in their home districts to offer some of the ideas to gifted students.          The participants observe the students in the companion workshop and             analyze the interaction between the students and the modern mathematical        ideas.",
