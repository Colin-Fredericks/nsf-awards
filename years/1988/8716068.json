 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this investigation is the depositional and                         tectonostratigraphic history of the Early Paleozoic paleo-Pacific               margin of Gondwana as seen in the Transantarctic Mountain Chain.  The           Cambrian succession of the southern Argentina Range is almost unknown,          but the range occupies a critical position at the Weddell Sea terminus          of the chain, in a region that seems to have been fragmented and                displaced during the breakup of Gondwana.  The sedimentological and             faunal history of this sequence will be documented and related to what          is known in adjacent ranges.  Available evidence suggests that a fault          with major displacement separates the Argentina Range from the                  Shackleton Range such that Cambrian rocks of deep-water facies lie              cratonwards of those laid down in shallower settings.  Conceivably,             one or more suspect terranes are present.  In a second area, the                complex Early Paleozoic deformational history south of the Byrd                 Glacier, suggests that current views of the Skelton Group in its type           area are in error.  These strata may be a Lower Paleozoic sequence              rather than a deformed Upper Proterozoic unit.  Detailed faunal,                sedimentological, and radiometric age dating will improve                       understanding of its true age and significance.",
