 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Sutton at the University of California, Berkeley, has                       constructed a receiver which can be used for astronomical                       observations at submillimeter wavelengths.  This project consists               primarily of enhancing the scientific capabilities of an                        otherwise working instrument.  By installing the receiver on a                  telescope and obtaining spectroscopic data on molecular lines at                a frequency of 345 GHz, Dr. Sutton will prove the performance of                his instrumentation for astronomical research in a newly opened                 window of the electromagnetic spectrum.                                                                                                                         The submillimeter wavelength region of the electromagnetic                      spectrum has been largely inaccessible for astronomical                         observations due to the limitations of the Earth's atmosphere as                well as technical difficulties with constructing receivers and                  telescopes for use at such short wavelengths.  That situation is                rapidly changing.  Currently a number of large, high surface                    accuracy telescopes are becoming available, and the scientific                  productivity is limited primarily by the quality of the                         receivers.  Several groups are constructing receivers for these                 telescopes.  Dr. Sutton is at the forefront of this receiver                    development effort.",
