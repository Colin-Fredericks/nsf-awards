 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides equipment, the MASSCOMP data acquisition and              signal processing system, for support of structural dynamics                    research.  Two projects, entitled Energy Flow in Mechanical Systems,            and Wavenumber Processing Techniques will utilize the equipment.  The           first project addresses a set of unresolved structural dynamics                 issues.  These include the ability to model structures with closely             spaced modes whose resonant bandwidths overlap in the frequency                 domain, and damping mechanisms at structural interfaces.  This                  project uses both a three dimensional space truss and a plate or                shell like structure supported on a grid or truss system.  Securing             useful data requires placing arrays of twelve accelerometers at two             locations on the structure.  Twenty four simultaneous channels of               data can thereby be acquired and processed by the MASSCOMP system.              The second project focuses on developing practical experimental                 techniques for studying the phenomenon of mode conversion.  This                occurs when flexural motion associated with one mode in one part of a           structure couples with longitudinal motion associated with a                    different mode in an adjoining part of the structure.  The method               used here is the spatial frequency or wavenumber processing                     technique.  It also requires taking simultaneous samples of                     structural deformation data from an array of accelerometers and then            processing the data through the MASSCOMP system.",
