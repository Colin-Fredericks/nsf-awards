 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new technology is explored for contacting liquid and fine                     particle slurry countercurrently.  High mass transfer rates and                 simple equipment make this technology attractive for continuous                 adsorptive separation of liquids.  Present technology simulates                 countercurrent plug flow of solid against liquid by cyclicly                    moving feeds and outlets along a stationary packed bed.  This                   method is limited by slow, complicated equipment and by slow mass               transfer rates.  Also greater than 100 micron diameter particles                must be used to avoid excessive pressure drop in the packed bed.                This process used a countercurrent cascade of newly developed                   particle fluidizers to contact liquid with a dense slurry of fine               adsorbent particles.  Equipment is simple and inexpensive, even                 when a large number of stages are used.  Smaller particle sizes                 (<20 microns) allows 25 to 200 times faster mass transfer.  This                process offers an order of magnitude lower capital and operating                costs due to simplicity and miniaturization.  Research is                       conducted to determine the feasibility, limitations, and                        important characteristics of the new process.  Experiment shows                 the ability of the fluidizer to concentrate adsorbent particle                  slurry and is used to determine the effectiveness of the                        liquid-adsorbent contacting.  A computer model is developed that                uses the experimental data to study the process as a whole.",
