 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ion lasers, which were first used for large-scale commercial                    applications in the late 1970's, have been improved steadily over the           past 10 years.  While replacements for these basically inefficient              lasers are frequently discussed, these replacements seem always to be           just over the horizon.  In fact, broad-based commercial applications            have been developed on the basis of continuous improvements in                  reliability and cost reduction.  The recent development of dense,               vacuum-tight aluminum nitride (AlN) presents the possibility of one             more major improvement in this technology.  Presently, the plasma-              confinement bore is made of beryllium oxide (BeO), which is expensive,          poisonous, and suffers from limited availability.  AlN, which is being          developed as a heatsink material for the electronics industry, is               potentially very low cost, non-toxic and is available from a wide               range of domestic suppliers.  The proposed work will evaluate the               suitability of AlN as a laser bore material.  Techniques for                    metalizing and brazing the material must be developed and the                   material's ability to withstand the heat loads and plasma erosion               effects of an air-colled ion laser must be tested.",
