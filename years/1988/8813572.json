 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grauer will use time-series photometry to study the late stages                 of stellar evolution, from the planetary nebula ejection phase                  through the white dwarf cooling phases.  He will be focusing on                 the central stars of planetary nebulae, variable white dwarfs,                  and binary stars.  He will be using a new portable two-star                     photometer, which he helped develop (National Science Foundation                (NSF) Grant AST 87-12249) and which he will be using at several                 observatories in the United States and abroad.  Furthermore, he                 will be participating in the Extended Coverage Network, which is                an international effort of observing variable stars from                        observatories around the globe in order to be independent of the                local diurnal cycle.                                                                                                                                            One of the central topics studied by astronomers is the birth,                  evolution, and death of stars.  Grauer will focus on the final                  stages in the evolution of stars, when many of them shed their                  outer layers forming so-called planetary nebulae (objects                       unrelated to planets).  The stars remaining after the loss of                   their outer layers contract into extremely compact objects,                     called white dwarfs, with masses comparable to that of the sun                  and sizes like the Earth's.  Some of the white dwarfs pulsate,                  with periods of the order of minutes.  They also are found in                   close proximity of other stars, with both stars orbiting about                  each other with periods of the order of hours.  The efficient                   observing of such pulsating and orbiting stars requires special                 observing equipment and techniques, both of which Grauer                        possesses.  Grauer will be involving undergraduate students under               NSF's Research for Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) Program.",
