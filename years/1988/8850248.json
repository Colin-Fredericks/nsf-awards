They will participate in a six-week summer program           made up of one-on-one laboratory training and project development;              classes in scientific ethics, problem solving, and career exploration;          orientation and participation in museum science; and field trips to             industrial, medical, and university laboratories and research sites.            Follow-up activities during the school year and subsequent summer are           also part of the project.  Key components of the UWM Young Scholars             Program are:  (1)  the joint participation of the Milwaukee City Museum         in presenting this program; (2) the commitment of ten key research              faculty from UWM and five from the Museum to participate as faculty             mentors in the Young Scholars Program; and (3) the availability of              continuing research activities for the young scholars in subsequent             summers through the university's high school apprenticeship programs            and local industrial internships.",
