 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central features of concurrent, parallel and distributed                    computation are captured in the settings of monoidal categories with            finite biproducts, countable coproducts, and distributive laws.  Such           categories are not only thoroughly researched, but central to any study         of dynamics.  In these categories the interplay of monoids (algebras)           and comonoids (coalgebras) play an important role in the analysis of            dynamics.  A traditional usage is in Hopf algebras, the central                 features of which abstract to bimonoids (bialgebras).                                                                                                           Processes which make progress by interaction require further research           into a different interplay between monoids and comonoids.  Call these           dimonoids (dialgebras).  In addition, careful attention must be paid to         the role of silent moves.  The combination of dimonoid structure with           nontrivial grade zero objects requires careful study.                                                                                                           The research will proceed first at the level of automata (semiautomata,         labeled transition systems) and then abstract to equivalence classes of         automata functorially.",
