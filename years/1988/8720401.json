 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfields of laser spectroscopy and mass                   spectrometry.  The thrust of this experimental activity is the                  development of new, highly selective methods of analysis for                    nonvolatile, thermally labile molecules, primarily biologically                 interesting ones.  To accomplish this end, neutral molecules are                desorbed from surfaces into the gas phase whereupon they are                    cooled through supersonic jet expansion which reduces their                     internal energy.  Once cooled, these molecules exhibit quite                    sharp-featured electronic spectra.  These sharp features enable                 the highly selective application of resonant two-photon ionization              techniques which are used to ionize these molecules for subsequent              analysis by time-of-flight mass spectrometry.                                                                                                                   This combination of laser desorption, supersonic jet expansion,                 resonant two-photon ionization, and mass spectrometry affords a                 sensitive, highly selective analytical tool for the qualitative                 and quantitative characterization of a broad spectrum of samples.               Whereas this hybrid approach will be primarily focussed on the                  analysis of biomolecules of pharmaceutical and clinical interest                such as catecholamines, indolamines, and small polypeptides, the                results of this research are can be expected to impact broadly in               the chemical, biological, and materials sciences.",
