 "awd_abstract_narration": "Segregation Distorter (SD) is naturally occurring meiotic                       drive system on the second chromosome of Drosophila                             melanogaster.  Contrary to Mendelian expectations,                              heterozygous SD/SD+ males transmit the SD chromosome in vast                    excess over the normal homolog.  The basis of this distorted                    transmission involves the induced dysfunction of the                            spermatids that receive the SD+ chromosome but the                              details of the mechanism are unknown.  The SD system                            comprises at least three distinct genetic components: the Sd,                   the E(SD), and the Rsp loci.  We have focused on                                characterizing the properties of these components with the                      aim of elucidating the structure, function, and orgin of SD                     chromosomes and their dynamics in natural populations.  We                      identified a 12 kb tandem duplication uniquely associated                       with all SD chromosomes, which we believe corresponds to Sd                     itself, and have identified putative Sd and Sd+ transcripts                     as well.  We will further characterize these transcripts and                    their relationship to each other by Northern analysis, S1                       nuclease mapping, and isolation and sequencing of cDNA                          clones.  Functional tests of the putative Sd clone will be                      carried out by P-mediated transformation.  Portions of the                      tandem duplication will be sequenced to determine its precise                   structure and to estimate its evolutionary age.  The                            spatial distribution of the Sd product will be assessed by in                   situ hybridization and immunolocalization.  Additional                          experiments are aimed at examining allelic variation at the                     Sd locus, the effect of genetic modifiers on its expression,                    and its possible homology with other drive systems.  We will                    also carry out further genetic analysis of E(SD) to test the                    generality of our observation that two doses of E(SD) can                       produce distortion in the absence of Sd and to examine the                      basis of this distortion.  Genetic tests to assess                              the possible existence of weak and strong E(SD) alleles and                     to discriminate between different hypotheses for the role of                    E(SD) in distortion are also planned.  Finally, the presence                    and frequency of E(SD) on non-SD chromosomes in natural                         populations will be determined.                                                                                                                                 The work proposed, as well as the work already done, has                        significant implications for our understanding of basic                         genetic mechanisms.  The presence of SD has a profound effect                   which can be quantified.  Yet, the results of the work from                     Dr. Ganetzkys laboratory have demonstrated that the mutation                    resulting in an SD phenotype is a 12 kilobase                                   tandem duplication.  Such duplications are not rare so                          the question is why this particular one has such major                          effects on the phenotype of organism.  The answers also                         impinge upon our understanding of both                                          evolutionary biology and population genetics.",
