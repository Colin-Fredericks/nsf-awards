 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major feature of the plate tectonic model is the concept of              a thermal boundary layer (TBL) at the earth's surface.  This TBL                serves as the upper boundary of the convective systems which drive              the plate motions, and is dominated by a conductive thermal                     regime.  Heat flow, subsidence, and other data have been used to                argue for no significant differences between the deep structures                under old ocean basins and old continents, both of which are at                 or very near a thermal equilibrium state.  This suggests that the               continental and oceanic lithospheres have the same thickness of                 about 150 km at equilibrium.  Differences must exist in the upper               lithosphere and crust to explain the buoyancy and mechanical                    behavior of continental material which helps govern its role in                 plate tectonics.  A number of competing models for the deep                     structure of the continents have been proposed which will be                    tested by estimating the deep electrical conductivity structure                 beneath the Canadian Shield.  The conductivity is a thermally                   activated process, and should be extremely sensitive to the                     radically different deep sub-shield mantle conditions associated                with differing models of the continental lithosphere.  The PIs                  will operate a very long period (VLP) magnetotelluric observatory               in the bottom of a deep freshwater lake.  This innovative                       deployment scheme overcomes many of the difficulties previously                 encountered in obtaining VLP MT data.",
