 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to identify a study group and                    to convene a workshop of a select group of scientists to address                the issues definitions, references, and survey techniques on the                demography of scientists and engineers with disabilities.  The                  participants will prepare an agenda and strategy for the                        development of an implementable methodology to study the                        demography of disabled scientists and engineers, and suggest                    interventions to increase the numbers of disabled individuals in                science and engineering.  The workshop is a first step in fully                 utilizing a group of individuals who are currently underutilized                and to increase their participation in educational programs                     leading to employment in science and engineering.                                                                                                               The papers produced by the workshop will be widely publicized                   to researchers in the areas of questionnaire and other sampling                 issues, as well as to the affiliated scientific and engineering                 societies of AAAS.                                                                                                                                              An additional component of the workshop is a third day to be                    held in conjunction with the U. S. Bureau of the Census, at which               a select sub-group  of the participants in the first two workshop               days will meet with a number of individuals from the Bureau of                  the Census to discuss the phrasing of the questions concerning                  disability in the 1990 Census.  These discussions will help in                  the final formulation of the Census questions concerning                        disability.                                                                                                                                                     These activities have important implications for the current                    and the future scientific and technological health of the United                States.  The identification of under-employed, disabled                         scientists and engineers will help to alleviate present shortages               if such persons are appropriately employed.  The motivation of                  young, disabled students will help to increase the shrinking                    cohort of 22-year-olds from which we will get our future supply                 of scientists and engineers.",
