This           year the meeting will be held in Japan and because it is the premier            meeting of its type, it is essential that U.S. participation be                 encouraged to further the U.S. leadership in this field.  With this             award, the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute will administer            travel grants for U.S. participants at the Ninth World Conference on            Earthquake Engineering.  The conference will be held during the period          of August 2-9, 1988.",
