 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is improving the quality and relevance of the first and            second courses dealing with chemical analysis through the use of                microcomputers and automated titrators.  This is being accomplished             through the use of four automatic titrators in conjunction with four            micro-computers.  This permits students to design and control automatic         titrations; to collect and process data; to learn a greater number of           volumetric methods including colorimetric, potentiometric and pH                titrations; and to become familiar wtih the application of computers to         new and old methods of analysis.  The automatic titrator/computer is            being used to do a series of titrations involving acids and bases;              redox titrations; and potentiometric titrations.  The equipment is              being used to teach students about a greater number of analytical               techniques and making it easier to use the laboratory experiments to            reinforce theoretical topics covered in the lecture.  It is also                enabling the teaching of methods of analysis through the use of                 computer simulation.  In addition many laboratory skills are being              taught in a more efficient and meaningful manner through the use of             computers in the laboratory setting.                                                                                                                            The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.",
