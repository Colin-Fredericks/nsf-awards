 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Mobbs proposes to examine the biochemical mechanisms                        mediating the effects of estrogen on lordosis behavior.  These                  effects of estrogen entail synthesis of polypepties in the                      ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMN) ; the peptides are               transported to, and released in the midbrain central gray (MGC).                Estrogen induces a specific protein that is transported from the                VMN to the MCG.  The physical properties of this protein suggest                that the protein is a member of the synaptic vesicle-uncoating                  stress protein family.  Using Western blots and                                 immunocytochemistry with appropriate antibodies, Dr. Mobbs will                 examine if the mRNA's of this protein family are induced by                     estrogen.  Using in vivo labelling followed by HPLC, Dr. Mobbs                  will examine if estradiol induces the synthesis and transport of                peptides implicated in the control of lordosis; he will examine                 if the inhibition of lordosis caused by antibodies to various                   peptides can be reversed by stimulators of adenylate cyclase                    and/or protein kinase C. These studies should suggest which                     peptides are acting through which second messenger systems.  The                studies may form the foundation for a biochemical explanation of                a specific mammalian sexual behavior.  Certain principles                       developed here, for example the role of synaptic                                vesicle-uncoating protein, may be applicable to control of                      neuronal connectivity in other systems.",
