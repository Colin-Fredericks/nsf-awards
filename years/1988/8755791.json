 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Summer Research Participation Program is currently in its thirty-           fifth year of operation at Roswell Park Memorial Institute (SUNY-               Buffalo). The institute is the oldest and one of the largest                    comprehensive cancer centers in the world. It is designed for high              ability high school seniors.  The objectives of the programs are: 1) to         teach each student functional scientific facts, principles and                  techniques employed in research; 2) to expose students to an active             research environment; 3) to allow the students to witness scientific            creativity; 4) to develop in each student the skills, habits and                attitudes required by scientific investigators; 5) to further develop           the students interest in science; and 6) to help the trainee in                 planning his/her academic career in science. The trainees fulfill these         objectives by implementing a research project in a research laboratory          under direct supervision of a senior investigator.  The remaining time          is spent attending formal lectures and seminars in specific areas of            biology, chemistry and biophysics conducted at the Institute.                                                                                                   Projects are assigned to students by their senior investigator who              serves as their summer mentor.  The Education Department assists senior         investigators in the selection of students to insure that the students'         interests and the objectives of the program are fulfilled.  A one-to-           one relationship between senior investigator and student is sought to           facilitate the learning process.",
