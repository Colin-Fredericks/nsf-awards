 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interactions between cultured, anchorage-dependent mammalian cells          and the surfaces upon which they are cultured will be investigated.             Primary human endothelial cells and 3T3 cells will be cultured on               surfaces whose properties have been systematically altered and                  carefully controlled.  Copolymers of derivitized alkyl methacrylates            will be used as the culture surface to determine the effect of surface          free energy and chemical moieties such as carboxyl, tertiaryamine,              and quaternary amine groups on cell adhesion, cell morphology, and              cell metabolism.  Cell morphology will be measured microscopically and          will include the maximum force of adhesion.  The role of specificcell           adhesion molecules will also be investigated.  Cell metabolism will be          investigated by measuring the cell growth rate, the synthesis of                extra cellular matrix, the release of growth factors, and there lease           of arachidonic acid metabolites.                                                                                                                                These investigations are important to advances in applied cell                  culture, both for biotechnological and biomedical use.                          Biotechnologically, mammalian cell culture is used to produce critical          and complex pharmaceuticals, and their performance with respect to the          surface characteristics of the bioreactor is poorly understood.                 Biomedically, tissue replacements are desired which involve live cells          attached to some synthetic support structure, for example, blood                vessel cells attached to a synthetic tube to serve as an artificial             blood vessel.  Invariably, some alteration in cell function is                  observed as a result of the surface interactions, and this can                  comprise the function of the tissue replacement.",
