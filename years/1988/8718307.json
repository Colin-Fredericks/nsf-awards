 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed experiments is to understand how two              cloned sequences, which exhibit a maternal-specific pattern of                  expression, function in early Drosophila development.  These sequences          were chosen from a group of maternal-specific sequences isolated in a           screen for genes active in early development based on their expression          pattern and cytological localization in a region amenable to genetic            analyses.  The assumption is made that genes whose messages are present         only in the oocyte and early embryo, prior to the onset of zygotic              transcription, should be involved in processes specific to this time            period, e.g., rapid nuclear division, cellularization, and determination        of axis polarity and external segmentation pattern.  A combination of           molecular, histological and genetic techniques will be used to answer           the following specific questions:  1) What is the effect of mutation in         the sequence? (maternal-effect lethality?)  2) What is the spatial              location of maternal transcript through oogenesis and early                     embryogenesis and how does it relate to the blastoderm fate map?  3)            What is the sequence of a cDNA clone homologous to the maternal                 transcript?  4) What is the temporal and spatial distribution of the            proteins encoded by the maternal RNAs?                                               This proposal is a direct approach to the molecular and genetic            analysis of a developmentally important class of genes.  The experiments        described here will provide information for an understanding of the role        of these genes in early embryonic development.",
