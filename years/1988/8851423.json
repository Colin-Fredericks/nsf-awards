 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is removing four perceived deficiencies in the Chemistry            curriculum.   The deficiencies are: 1) lack of student exposure to              modern, computerized instrumentation; 2) lack of laboratory courses at          an advanced level; 3) lack of any laboratory work in the important area         of polymer chemistry; and 4) lack of modern instrumentation to maintain         a vigorous undergraduate research program.  The grant is allowing the           purchase of modern computerized spectroscopic instruments, computers to         control them, equipment to introduce polymer chemistry into the                 curriculum, and a rapid kinetics spectrometer.  The instruments are             being used to revamp entirely the first term of the junior level                physical chemistry laboratory that is taken by all chemistry majors.            In addition, the second term of the physical chemistry sequence that            features kinetics and spectroscopy is also being substantially changed          in order to incoporate the new capabilities into the laboratory.  A new         course in the chemical applications of magnetic resonance is being              added to the curriculum to give students laboratory experience at the           advanced level.                                                                                                                                                 The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.",
