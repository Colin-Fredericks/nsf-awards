 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program                  supports research by Dr. Philip Warner, Iowa State University,                  which aims at elucidating the chemical reactivity of carbenes,                  carbenoids, and organolithium species.  Carbenes and carbenoids                 are reactive chemical fragments which occur as transient                        intermediates in many important chemical reactions.                             Understanding their chemical behavior is the key to effective                   utilization for organic synthesis of such carbenic processes as                 cyclopropanation, the Skattebol rearrangement, and other                        reactions.                                                                                                                                                      Dr. Warner's research will probe particular aspects of the                      structure and reactivity of carbenes and carbenoids, including                  the net loss of carbon from cyclopropylidenes upon interaction                  with certain nucleophiles, and from cyclopropylidenoids upon                    oxidation.  A method of photogenerating three-membered ring                     carbenes, including oxiranylidene, will be developed for                        application to measurement of fast reaction kinetics and                        cryogenic studies.  Laser flash photolytic methodology will be                  applied to the analysis of intramolecular carbene                               rearrangements, and NMR methods will be employed for                            determination of the structure of dilithiocyclopropanes.",
