 "awd_abstract_narration": "Specialized visual symbols, such as dress, have been used by                    many peoples to denote rank, status, affiliation, or class in                   plural societies.  While anthropologists have recognized that                   this is a common way to publicly express social identity,                       little attention has been paid to why groups develop                            distinctive styles and how other groups react socially and                      politically to these developments.                                                                                                                              This project analyzes recent developments in \"National Band\"                    paramilitary groups among the Herero pastoralists of southern                   Africa.  These associations have begun to use Victorian and                     Westernized military forms of dress as vehicles for the public                  expression of social identity in resistance rituals.  The                       material culture used in the rituals will be examined in                        relation to the regional sociopolitical context and                             transformations in Herero society.                                                                                                                              This study will enable us to better understand the nonviolent                   forms of political resistance in Botswana and Namibia used by                   tribal groups, while demonstrating the dynamics that underlie                   the relationship between material culture and social identity.",
