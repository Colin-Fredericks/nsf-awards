 "awd_abstract_narration": "Liquid crystals composed of large, enlongated molecules have               significance in materials science.  The high degree of                          orientational order achieved in solutions of these polymers may                 be passed on to the solid state.  This extra order of orientation               results in synthetic materials of very high strength and                        temperature resistance.  The research program outlined here                     focuses on polymers that are elongated due to an internal helical               arrangement of their subunits.  Two classes of polymers that are                helical for very different reasons will be studied:  polypeptides               held in helical organization by internal hydrogen bonding among                 the monomers, and polyisocyanates that maintain the helical                     conformation due to side-chain interactions.  We will examine the               effects of progressive flexibility, usually brought on by                       variation of solvent character, in solutions of such                            macromolecules on phase transitions and liquid crystal formation.               Molecular orientational order will be correlated with chain                     stiffness, as measured by the persistence length of the polymer.                The influence of chain rigidity on a liquid crystal elastic                     modulus will be explored.  Solvent variations will be examined on               a magnetic filed induced depression of the liquid crystal to                    isotropic transition temperature.  Finally, a unique double,                    helix-to-coil transition in dilute solution of one of the                       polypeptides will be further delineated.",
