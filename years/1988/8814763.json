 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since World War II, science-based or \"high tech\" industry has                   become the motor of advanced economies.  Efforts to enhance                     national competitiveness and regional development by encouraging                cooperation between research enterprises and industry has taken                 several forms, but one of the most dramatic has been the                        science/technology-industry interactive regional complex or                     \"growth-center.\"  This phenomenon has been in evidence world-                   wide.  In the United States, \"Route 128 near Boston and \"Silicon                Valley\"  in Santa Clara County, California, have been the largest               and most successful examples.  These research regions or \"science               cities\" have received relatively little attention from historians               of science and technology.  With this initial grant, Drs. Kargon                and Leslie, who are respectively historians of science and                      technology, and Dr. Schoenberger, a geographer, will collaborate                in an effort to organize an interdisciplinary study of the roots,               nature and dynamics of science-technology research and industry                 complexes.  Starting with Silicon Valley and Route 128 as                       prototypes, they intend to examine three case studies.  This                    grant will allow them to identify these three study sites, locate               the most significant institutional actors within each site, and                 assess the key archival and published sources.",
