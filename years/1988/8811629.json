 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research project is to create electrooptical devices           for optical communications and/or computing systems using nonlinear             optical materials.  In particular, nonlinear optical composites will            be fabricated and characterized by placing highly nonlinear organic             molecules in inorganic matrices.  Nonlinear effects have been shown to          be much larger in organics compared to the best inorganics.                     Significant fabrication problems exist, however, in developing                  materials containing organic molecules.                                                                                                                         A possible solution to these problems lies in the sol-gel process for           making glass.  In this project, sol-gel solutions will be used as the           host material for optical organic molecules.  The new organic-                  inorganic composite material will be formed by mixing nonlinear                 optical organics into the sol-gel solution so that SiO2 is the host.            The sol-gel should form a SiO2 cage around each organic molecule                locking it in place.  Alignment of the organic molecule composites is           accomplished by the poling techniques in order to observe the                   necessary second order effects.  By depositing sucessive layers of              sol-gel with different indices, nonlinear optical waveguides can be             realized.                                                                                                                                                       The general plan of research is essentially synthesis (fabrication),            characterization (of materials), and device realization.",
