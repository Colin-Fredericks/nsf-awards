An existing example is the                Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (RMS) and future plans call for               other RMS-like arms to automate space operations, such as                       assembly.  A                                                                    key problem to be resolved is to dampen the vibrations caused by                the                                                                             necessary long reach and lightweight construction of the RMS                    system.                                                                         The objective of this research project is to investigate the                    potential                                                                       passive damping characteristics of piezoelectric film coatings                  when                                                                            applied to flexible structural members.  It is proposed to use a                polymer film, PVDF, which has piezoelectric characteristic, to                  dessipate vibrational energy by means of an electric current.  A                layer                                                                           of PVDF film applied to the surface of a vibrating member will                  generate an electric current due to mechanical deformations.  The               electric current can be passed through a passive impedance thus                 dessipating vibrational energy thereby reducing the vibrations.                 Using PVDF film to passively dampen vibrations is a new idea                    which has                                                                       not been investigated.  The ultimate goal is to provide an easily               implemented modification to the RMS, or similar flexible                        manipulator                                                                     that enhances performance without significantly increasing system               cost, weight, and complexity of control or computational costs.",
