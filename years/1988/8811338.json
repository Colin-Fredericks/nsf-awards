 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the grant is to define aspects of the genetic                  regulation of Streptomyces coelicolor morphological and                         physiological differentiation.  The emphasis is on the transition               from the vegetative to the differentiated colony, as manifested                 by onset of antibiotic synthesis and by the growth of prespore                  aerial hyphae.  The specific aims are:                                                                                                                               1.  Genetic and phenotypic Characterization of the new                              developmental mutants.  We will refine the genetic                              characterization of the newly identified absA, bldH loci                        by performing complementation and fine-structure mapping                        studies.  We will also continue the phenotypic                                  characterization of the bld mutants.                                                                                                                        2.  Cloning and molecular characterization of the new                               developmental genes absA, bldG and bldH.  We will clone                         these genes and use the cloned alleles for                                      complementation studies and for sequencing the wild-type                        and mutant alleles.                                                                                                                                    This genetic and molecular analysis of the abs and bld genes                    promises to contribute not only to our understanding of microbial               multicellular development and differentiation, but also to  the                 potential for rational manipulation of naturally occurring                      antibiotic synthesis.",
