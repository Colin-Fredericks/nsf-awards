 "awd_abstract_narration": "Undergraduate engineering curricula in the U.S. require issues                  of engineering ethics to be addressed.  Engineers and the                       engineering profession recognize that students need to learn how                to use and assess available information in making ethical                       decisions, and how to test and develop their own perspectives on                professional ethics.  They need to develop the thought processes                necessary to integrate information with acceptable professional                 \"norms\" of behavior, to make ethical decisions.  Yet, surveys                   demonstrate little in the way of formal or systematic approaches                to the development and testing of new curricula or teaching                     methods.  This project will develop an interactive computer                     simulation to assist in teaching undergraduate engineering                      students to develop critical thinking skills and apply them to                  the consideration of ethical, legal and social aspects of                       engineering decisions. The goal is to develop a tool that can                   serve to supplement and extend traditional teaching in                          engineering ethics.  This initial phase of the project will                     develop and test an expert system simulation of one to five                     scenarios.  Several expert system shells will be evaluated for                  this purpose.  Data bases for the simulation will be designed to                incorporate data from all branches of engineering and all states;               but the initial model will use data collected only from Iowa and                from civil engineering.  The computer data bank will contain                    information from professional societies and advice from                         colleagues and attorneys, and from other sources, which students                must evaluate to arrive at their final decisions.  The approach                 should provide students with simulated real world experiences and               expose them to the complexities and uncertainties in resolving                  problems in engineering ethics.                                                                                                                                 This project addresses an important issue in a unique way.  The                 research team is interdisciplinary and well qualified to                        collaborate in the development of the \"engineering ethics                       tutorial.\"  Collaboration and further effort are likely to                      continue beyond the duration of this award.  The project is                     designed well; appropriate testing and dissemination are planned                for this initial phase.  University support is good.  An award in               the amount of $91,420 is therefore recommended, to be made in two               equal increments.  The first half will be awarded in this fiscal                year.",
