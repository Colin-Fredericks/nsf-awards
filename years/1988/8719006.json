 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to develop a mathematical                  model of double headed crossbridge attachment in skeletal muscle                fibers.  In the model, a crossbridge is treated as a double                     headed macromolecule with one actin and one nucleotide site per                 head.  The critical assumption is the hypothesis that once one of               the heads of a crossbridge is attached to one of the available                  actin sites, the attachment of the second head will be restricted               to a level of strain determined by the attachment of the first                  head.  The crossbridge structure, namely the connection of both                 heads of a crossbridge to the same tail region, is assumed to                   impose this constraint on the spatial configurations of cross                   bridge heads.  The research will be focused initially on                        equilibrium muscle behavior because the crossbridge cycle is much               simpler in this case than the corresponding cycle for contracting               muscle.  The effects of nucleotide concentration and ionic                      strength on double headed crossbridge attachment will be studied                by comparing model predictions with experimental data on,  (1)                  the time course of force decay following an imposed stretch, and                (2) the variation of fiber stiffness as a function of ionic                     strength.  In the proposed scheme, a crossbridge head is more                   likely to reattach to its previously strained position than to                  remain unattached while the other head is attached, leading to a                slow decay of force after stretch as measured in experiments                    conducted under equilibrium conditions.                                              The proposed research should yield significant information                 on crossbridge structure, and lead to better understanding of the               origins of crossbridge stiffness which represents an important                  component of the mechanics of muscle.",
