 "awd_abstract_narration": "A program of theory and experiments on optical guiding effects in a             free electron laser (FEL) will be conducted using Columbia                      University's existing 2 mm-wavelength Raman FEL oscillator system.  In          an FEL, the electron beam is the source of energy for the                       amplification of the radiation field.  An important development has             been the discovery that the electron beam, under certain conditions,            can also help confine or focus the coherent radiation.  This effect,            known as optical guiding, has become a subject of considerable                  interest recently, both in the high-gain Compton and Raman regimes.             Experiments for isolating guiding effects on the electron beam will be          done in the regime of small-signal exponential growth and in                    saturation.  The theory supports the experiment by developing 2D                computer codes which accurately following the growth of the EM fields           along the beam in an overmoded waveguide containing a filamentary               beam.  Theory also will explore analytically and numerically the                effect of the optical guiding on the sideband instability, and                  experiment can study this once the optical guiding conditions are               isolated.  As shown in the proposal, optical guiding should occur               under conditions of long wave length and low beam energy as well as at          short wavelength.",
