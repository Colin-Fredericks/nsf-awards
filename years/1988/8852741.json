 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Department is purchasing equipment to enhance the                     development of data acquisition and analysis skills in undergraduate            students -- both majors and non-majors.  Computer simulations and               interactive videos are creating an environment in which non-major               students can collect and evaluate data without being dependent on               manual skills.  This enables even scientifically naive students to              become involved quickly in scientific pursuits and to begin to                  experience ways in which scientists solve problems.  In upper level             courses (including research projects) majors have opportunities to work         with computer-interfaced instruments to speed data collection and to            accomplish calculations that enable the student to interpret and draw           conclusions from related groups of facts.  The thrust of the project is         to spend more time thinking about the implications of data sets than is         spent in acquiring the factual information.                                                                                                                          The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
