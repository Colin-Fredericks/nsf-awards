 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid development and intensification of winter cyclones               in coastal regions presents a major weather forecasting problem.                Along the East Coast of the United States, the development of                   cyclonic storms and frontal systems often occurs along the                      coastal region of the Carolinas.  These weather systems may lead                to severe weather in the heavily populated Northeast Corridor in                the form of freezing rain, heavy snowfall, blizzards and                        extensive coastal erosion.  A complex interaction of cold                       continental air, warm ocean currents, traveling atmospheric                     disturbances and local geography all appear to contribute to the                rapid development of these systems; however, the processes are                  not well understood and the phenomena are often poorly forecast.                     In January-March 1986 a cooperative research project to                    study winter storms in this region was held by a consortium of                  universities and Federal agencies.  Entitled GALE (Genesis of                   Atlantic Lows Experiment), the project was designed to provide                  detailed information on the role of air-sea interaction,                        planetary boundary-layer processes and mesoscale meteorological                 processes.  As one of the core investigators of the GALE, the                   Principal Investigator was instrumental in designing and                        executing the experiment.                                                            Using the specialized data sets collected during the GALE,                 the Principal Investigator will carry out a number of studies.                  The major goals of the research are to describe the mesoscale                   structure and precipitation producing mechanisms in frontal                     systems and to investigate the mechanisms responsible for                       organized mesoscale precipitation features.  Included in this                   research will be unique applications of Doppler radar data and                  information from numerical models in the diagnosis of mesoscale                 rainbands.",
