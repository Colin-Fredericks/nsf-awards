 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of eight U.S. scientists              in a seminar on the \"Persistence of Pasture Legumes,\" organized                 jointly by Professor A.G. Matches of Texas Tech University, Dr. R.J.            Clements of the  Australian CSIRO Division of Tropical Crops and                Pastures, and Dr. G.W. Sheath of the Whatawhata Hill Country                    Research Station, Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, New                    Zealand.  Participants from the U.S., Australia and New Zealand will            meet at the University of Hawaii in July 1988.  The major themes of             the seminar will be development and growth characteristics of                   legumes, stresses caused by climate and soils, pests and diseases,              Rhizobium symbiosis, genetics and breeding for persistence, and the             management of legumes.                                                                                                                                          The poor persistence of legumes in pasture lands of the U.S.,                   Australia and New Zealand is a vexing problem.  Research leading to             more widespread establishment and persistence of pasture legumes                would result in increased production of foraging stock and an                   enrichment of soil nitrogen levels.  This seminar will bring                    together leading scientists from three countries in order to discuss            the present state of knowledge on the persistence of pasture                    legumes.  The seminar participants will identify gaps in current                knowledge and establish priorities for future cooperative research.",
