 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. Erhard Krempl of Rensselaer Polytechnic                 Institute for collaborative research in mechanical engineering with Dr.         Elmar Steck of the Institute of Mechanics at the Technical University           of Braunschweig, Federal Republic of Germany.  Research groups at both          institutions are studying viscoplasticity by developing and testing             models of the inelastic behavior of materials under stress.  While              their theories have some common characteristics, they are based on              completely different philosophies or approaches.  The U.S. group has            developed a phenomenological, experimentally verified viscoplasticity           theory based on overstress; the West German group is working on a               stochastic, microstructurally based theory.  Their collaboration is             aimed at giving the phenomenological viscoplasticity theory a                   microstructural base and at extending the stochastic theory to                  arbitrary loading in one dimension and to a three-dimensional                   formulation.  The excellent experimental facilities at RPI will be used         to test the emerging models.                                                                                                                                    Modern materials and production techniques together with economic               demands have led to weight reduction and increasingly severe operating          conditions for a great variety of mechanical equipment.  Simple                 analytical methods for predicting performance of materials under stress         are no longer adequate.  Most limiting states of structural materials           are associated with nonlinear, inelastic behavior; modeling such                behavior has only become possible in the past decade or so with the             availability of sophisticated computational techniques.  Further                understanding of material behavior under stress and improvement of              material models can be expected from this analysis and synthesis of             different approaches to the study of plasticity.",
