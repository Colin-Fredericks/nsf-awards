 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years there has been considerable interest in estimating the          effect of risk upon economic decisions.  Applied studies have been made         of the effects of risk upon foreign exchange markets, trade flows,              output and unemployment, and stock prices.  Generally the method used           to model such effects has been to make the risk term a linear or                quadratic function of some observed variables.                                                                                                                  There is increasing evidence from a number of sources that the                  resulting models are generally inadequate and that the effects are,             therefore, measured incorrectly.  The purpose of this project is to             develop statistical procedures that enable much better specification of         the risk term.  A number of methods will be investigated ranging from           the use of the residuals to identify suitable functions to capture the          risk term to non-parametric estimation techniques.  This research is            important because it will develop new estimation techniques that will           strengthen empirical research in economics.",
