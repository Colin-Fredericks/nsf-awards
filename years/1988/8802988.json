 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, ecologists and other biologists have come to              appreciate the importance of physiological studies in understanding the         distribution of particular animal and plant species in nature.  Such            studies of plants, as well as related genetic and systematic analyses,          require well-controlled growth facilities so that plants can be raised          under reproducible conditions.  The ability to determine, and to alter          at will, factors such as light intensity, day length and temperature is         crucial for investigation of the physiological and morphological                responses of plants to their environments.  Beyond their use in                 understanding ecology, studies of the effects of environmental factors          can eventually play an important role in the development of new and             improved strains of crop plants.                                                      The funds provided by this award will initiate the planning phase         of the construction of a research greenhouse at the University of               Alaska in Fairbanks.  Costs of construction are to be assumed by the            University.  A supplementary NSF award to provide environmental control         systems for the greenhouse and to provide plant growth chambers to be           housed in the greenhouse complex is anticipated.  The University                currently lacks adequate growth chamber and greenhouse facilities, a            major shortcoming of one of the few, if not only, universities well-            positioned for significant studies of Arctic and Subarctic                      environments.  Furthermore, construction of the greenhouse will improve         the quality of studies to be performed in collaboration with the Long           Term Ecological Research Site recently established near Fairbanks.",
