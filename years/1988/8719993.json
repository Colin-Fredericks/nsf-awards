 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research deals with an experimental and theoretical study of               concentrated polymer solutions in strong flows.  The objective is               a better understanding of the changes in polymer conformation                   which occur as a consequence of the flow, and conversely, the                   modifications of the flow which occur because of the polymer.                   The proposed experimental measurements utilize a two-color                      birefringence system to provide real-time data on polymer                       conformation in transient conditions, and dynamic light                         scattering to obtain local, instantaneous data on the velocity                  gradient in the flow.  From a fundamental point of view, the                    concern is with the relationship between molecular parameters,                  particularly the molecular weight and molecular-weight                          distribution, on polymer relaxation phenomena in the so-called                  \"viscoelastic\" regime of large deformation from the equilibrium                 state.  In a more general sense, the research deals with the                    effects of various kinds if flow on polymer conformation, and                   with the implications for polymer processing, including the                     potential for manipulation of macroscopic properties of polymeric               materials through flow-induced modifications of conformation.",
