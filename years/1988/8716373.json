 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources (ILAR) is a                   component of the National Academy of Sciences.  The Institute's                 major goal is to provide information that will help to improve                  the availability, quality, care, and humane and scientifically                  valid use of laboratory animals.  More specifically, ILAR is                    responsible for developing and making available guidelines for                  animal care, use and breeding; for describing animal models for                 human diseases and physiological processes; for providing source                data on commercial and non-commercial stock colonies; and for                   conducting surveys of animal facilities and resources.  During                  its 35-year history, ILAR has established itself worldwide as a                 key advisory group in the labotory animal field.                                     This project will provide partial funding for ILAR for the                 next three years.  The funds will be used as partial support for                the Animal Models and Genetic Stocks Information Exchange                       Program, for the publication of ILAR News, for the meetings of                  two standing committees (the ILAR Council and the Committee on                  Animal Models and Genetic Stocks) composed of noted experts in                  the field of animal care, and for other general operating                       expenses of the Institute.",
