 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry provides                     support for the work of Dr. Robert Taft, University of                          California, Irvine. This work is focused on understanding and                   quantitatively predicting the effects of structure and solvent                  on the acidities and basicities of organic molecules.                           Acidities are considered in the broadest sense which includes                   hydrogen-bond donors and metal ions as well as proton-electron                  pair acceptors.  Gas phase studies will be used to evaluate and                 treat the inherent effects of molecular structure and solvent                   effects.  Such results provide an important means to advance                    theory. The effects of solvent on rates of reactions of organic                 molecules is one of the most important aspects of this study.                                                                                                   This work has many immediate practical applications especially                  in atmospheric and condensed phase chemistry.  The latter                       includes improvements in the methods of synthetic organic and                   organometallic chemistry, in drug design, in analysis of                        toxicities of pollutants, in solubilities in liquids, polymers                  and biological fluids and tissues, and in the chemistry of fuel                 cells.",
