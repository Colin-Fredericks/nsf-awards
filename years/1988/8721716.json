 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research between scientists of the              US and Taiwan on the diversity and biology of the Lepidoptera fauna             of Taiwan.  This study of moths is important as a contribution to               the ongoing effort to correlate moth diversity in local sites with              corresponding plant associations, and to determine the feasibility              of using moths as environmental indicator species in conservation               areas.  The compact nature of Taiwan, together with the rapid rate              of its population growth pressing on the natural resources of the               island, provides what may be a unique opportunity for                           experimentation on the theory of using moths as an environmental                indicator.                                                                                                                                                      The goals of the project are to provide the groundwork of specimens             and biological data to monograph Taiwan's Lepidoptera fauna.                    Information from this cooperative effort will provide detailed                  taxonomic studies of moths, which is expected to lay the groundwork             for further experimental studies.  This project involves extensive              cooperation with scientists of Taiwan, and reflects a common concern            about the ongoing effects of environmental changes on natural                   ecosystems.",
