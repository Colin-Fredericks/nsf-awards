 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on tropical plants and animals is especially                   important at this time because of the current high rates of                     destruction of tropical forests and the imminent extinction of                  many species that inhabit them.  Dr. John Kress of the Marie                    Selby Botanical Gardens plans to study the South American species               of the banana-relative Heliconia, a genus which includes the                    horticultural lobster-claw plants.  Field collecting will be                    conducted in northern South America, to acquire living materials                and preserved specimens.  These will serve as the basis for study               of macroscopic and microscopic features of the plants.                          Especially important will be investigations of pollen structure                 using the scanning electron microscope, in which Dr. Kress has                  already found distinctive patterns for many species.                                    Information from morphology, geographic distributions, and              habitats will be integrated into a comprehensive taxonomic                      treatment of the estimated 80 species of Heliconia that produce                 hanging or pendent inflorescences and their relatives.  The study               will improve understanding of tropical forest diversity and help                in analyzing processes of speciation and evolution in tropical                  environments.",
