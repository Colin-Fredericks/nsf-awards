 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to investigate the                       mechanisms responsible for the development of crystallographic                  texture in iron neodymium boron compounds when they are processed               by low temperature hot pressing.  The texture will be determined                experimentally using x-ray diffraction techniques.  The mechanism               of crystallographic orientation will be studied by optical                      microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission                      electron microscopy.  The pertinent magnetic properties (e.g.                   magnetization, remanence, coercive field) will be measured.                          The research is important to improvement of understanding of               the thermal processing of technologically important high energy                 permanent magnets.  The United States has been a world leader in                research on permanent magnets, but the Japanese were the world                  leaders in manufacturing of these materials.  The U.S. magnet                   manufacturers are becoming more competitive, and research such as               this is needed to continue our competitive growth.  The training                of students in the area of magnetic materials is also a very                    important aspect of this research, as only a few universities in                the U.S. are actively training students in this topic.",
