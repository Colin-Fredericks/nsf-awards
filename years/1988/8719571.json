 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nutrient uptake length, the distance traveled by a nutrient atom                before being biotically or abiotically removed from solution,                   provides an index of stream retention and therefore has                         implications concerning production and efficiency.  Previous                    studies found an inverse relationship between quantity of course                particulate organic matter (CPOM) in the stream and nutrient                    uptake length.  It is hypothesized that in addition to CPOM                     quantity, microbial colonization patterns and breakdown rates of                CPOM are also important in regulating uptake length.  This                      hypothesis will be tested by constructing nine artificial streams               and conducting two 6-8 month long experiments.  In experiment 1,                three leaf types with different microbial colonization patterns                 and breakdown rates will be used.  One leaf type will be placed                 in each stream (three replicates of each leaf type) and nutrient                uptake length will be measured biweekly for several months.  In                 experiment 2, a mixture of leaf types will be placed in each                    stream.  Leaf shredding invertebrates will be placed in some                    streams and excluded from others to determine how shredding                     affects nutrient uptake through its impact on microbial activity                and breakdown rates.  A lab experiment will be done concurrent                  with field work to determine the relative importance of biotic                  and abiotic uptake.",
