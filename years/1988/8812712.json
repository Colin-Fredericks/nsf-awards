 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM)                    Field Station was begun in 1967.  Since then the UWM Field                      Station has grown steadily in research use and productivity.  The               attractiveness of the Station for research can be attributed to                 the quality of its natural areas and facilities, the baseline                   information available, ongoing research, its location, and the                  level of assistance and on-site support provided by the staff.                  Located near Milwaukee, Madison and Chicago, the 850 ha research                area includes one of the finest remaining examples of beech-maple               woods in Wisconsin, nearly all of the predominant wetland                       vegetation types found in northwestern North America, old fields                and agricultural fields.  Long-range plans for the Field Station                research program emphasize: 1) development of the Station and the               Cedarburg Bog as a wetlands research center, 2) maintenance of                  its strong program in avian behavioral ecology, and 3)                          experimental plant ecology, population biology, and ecological                  genetics.  The Station has an extensive and diverse long-term                   data base that has been developed over 20 years.  Expansion of                  the data base and enhancement of its utility and accessibility                  are currently being stressed.                                                        This project will support replacement of the Station's                     outdated and increasingly unreliable weather station in order to                maintain and improve the quality of the data base and to fulfill                research program plans.",
