 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, with partial support            from NSF, will develop science, mathematics, and technology components          for a new, permanent 17,000 square foot exhibition on the Pacific.              Broad in scope and dramatic in its impact, this exhibition will cut             across many fields and disciplines in presenting a coherent, integrated         view of the Pacific regions.  Topics from anthropology, geology,                biology and geography will be combined using collections, reconstructed         objects, large scale models, and interactive components in this                 landmark exhibition.  The project will make extensive use of leading            researchers, educators, and an evaluation consultant, and will utilize          a variety of prototyping and formative exhibit development techniques.          The science, mathematics and technology portion will cost $ 1.9                 million, of which approximately one third is requested from NSF.  The           complete 17,000 square foot exhibition will cost $ 3.3 million and will         be seen by at least 10 million adults and children over its 20 year             life.",
