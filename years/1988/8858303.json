 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research covers the following five areas:                             a) Cold rolling of polymers and their blends:  In this area the main            research is concentrated in understanding the deformation fields in             rolling and characterization of structures developed in compatible              and incompatible polymer blends.                                                b) Forging of polymer powders and their mixtures with other polymers            and/or low melting metals:  Forging process allows the production of            composite parts out of materials with widely varying                            thermal-deformation characteristics which is normally not possible              in standard melt processing                                                     operations.                                                                     c) Optical properties of polymer films:  The main area of interest              is to investigate the optical properties (i.e. refractive indices)              as a function of film processing conditions.                                    d) Effect of polymeric substrate surface characteristics on the                 growth behavior of vacuum deposited metals: The effect of surface               roughness, crystallographic orientation and crystallinity in polymer            substrate on the growth behavior of silver metal is currently being             investigated.                                                                   e) Welding of Plastics:  The goal of this area is to investigate the            processing-structure-property relationships in spin, vibration and              ultrasonic welding of plastics.",
