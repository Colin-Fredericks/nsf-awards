 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a workshop on experimental particle physics             to be held at the Centro Internacional de Fisica (CIF) in Bogota,               Colombia.  The workshop, jointly organized by Prof. Uriel Nauenberg             of the University of Colorado at Boulder and Prof. Galileo Violini,             Executive Director of the CIF, will have as its main objective an               overview of the present status of experimental activity in                      elementary particle physics, with emphasis on topics of potential               research interest to physicists in Latin America.  Topics to be                 discussed include: accelerator and non-accelerator experiments in               particle physics, experimental astrophysics, cosmology, technologies            associated with experimental particle physics such as synchrotron               radiation, superconducting magnets, cryogenics, and vacuum systems,             radiation therapy and nuclear medicine, and advanced electronics and            computers.  A final objective will be a review of the present                   experimental activity in Latin America and the feasibliity of new               experimental projects in the near future with close attention to                collaboration with centers of research in the industrialized world              such as Fermilab in the U.S. and CERN.                                                                                                                          The workshop will include active research physicists and is aimed at            stimulating collaborative ties between researchers in Latin America             and at major experimental research centers in the U.S.  As such it              builds on existing ties with other collaborative particle physics               groups elsewhere in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and                   Mexico.  By bringing experimentalists of renown to discuss with                 their Latin American counterparts feasible projects for developing              countries, this workshop serves to advance the objectives of the                Science in Developing Countries Program.",
