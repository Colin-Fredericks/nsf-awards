 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. James E. Bayfield and                Dr. Richard H. Pratt, Department of Physics and Astronomy,                      University of Pittsburgh, to pursue with Dr. Sung Dahm Oh,                      Department of Physics, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul, Korea,              for a period of 24 months, a program of cooperative theoretical                 research on multipole matrix element zeroes in resonances in                    independent particle approximation.  Specifically, the project will             deal with theoretical investigations of \"Cooper Minima\" and shape               resonances, two main features which distinguish radiation                       transitions in a screened atom from the simple point Coulomb                    hydrogenic case.                                                                                                                                                This project involves cooperative research of two groups of                     investigators who have complementary skills and facilities.  The key            collaborators are highly respected scientists who, for a number of              years, have cooperated in the field of the research.  Their                     cooperation has been highly successful and has resulted in several              joint publications in refereed journals.  The proposed study of                 multipole matrix element zeroes and resonances will shed light on               the deviations from simple point Coulomb behavior in the case of                electronic screening.  This project is relevant to the objectives of            the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase              the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and                 engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas,                skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of                 mutual benefit.",
