Mount from the University of              California, Davis to collaborate with Dr. Chris C. von der Borch of             Flinders University, Australia over a period of two years.  They will           study rock and fossil records from the base of the Cambrian System in           the Adelaide region of South Australia.  The project will entail:  (1)          evaluation of unpublished literature and the available fossil                   collections from the area; (2) field collection of rock and fossil data         from three localities within the Adelaide region; and (3) laboratory            analysis of stratigraphic sections.                                                                                                                             The purpose of analyzing the fossil/rock associations in South                  Australia is to evaluate the paleoenvironmental context of earliest             Cambrian fauna and to determine how the history of shelf sedimentation          has controlled the fossil record of the unprecedented appearance and            diversification of organisms during that era.  Stratigraphic analysis           will be expedited because of the substantial amount of basic                    descriptive work which has already been carried out for the study               sites.  The respective expertise of Drs. Mount and von der Borch on the         paleogeography of the Lower Cambrian strata of the southwestern Great           Basin, U.S.A. and the Adelaide region of South Australia will enable a          valuable comparative analysis of equivalent faunal records from these           two continents.",
