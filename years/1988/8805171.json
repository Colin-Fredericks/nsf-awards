 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program will explore the structure and electronic properties               of transition metals in non-equilibrium crystal structures.                     These metastable structures will be produced in the form of                     ultra-thin films using atomic layer epitaxial growth techniques.                Some of the metal film crystals are metastable because they adopt               a crystal structure through epitaxy which is not the preferred                  structure at room-temperature.  Other structures found in                       epitaxial growth are completely new, and exist only as films                    stabilized by the choice of an appropriate substrate template.                  One of the first unique metastable metal stuctures was BCC                      cobalt, grown as film on a semiconductor substrate.  BCC cobalt                 does not exist as a stable bulk phase.  Metastable film                         structures and growth modes will be studied by a combination of                 techniques which will probe both long-range and short-range order               in the films.  These techniques include electron diffraction and                angle-resolved x-ray photoelectron diffraction (ARXPD).  The                    ARXPD technique has unique characteristics, such as elemental                   specificity, which will allow them to unambiguously identify the                presence of new metastable film structures.  Electronic                         properties of this new class of materiasl will be studied using                 angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with synchrotron                      radiation.",
