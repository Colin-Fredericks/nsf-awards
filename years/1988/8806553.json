The process of introducing                     observations which are distributed in time into a forecast model                is known as four dimensional data assimilation.  Observations                   cannot perfectly describe the state of the atmosphere at a given                time.  Ideally, an assimilation should produce the best \"fit\" of                the data observations while satisfying the dynamical properties                 of the governing equations as embodied in the model.  Under this                award, the PI and his colleagues will employ an assimilation                    method which uses optimal control theory to minimize the                        differences between the evolution of the observations and the                   dynamical constraints of the model.  This technique requires the                determination of the adjoint of the models employed, in this                    case, models used at the National Meteorological Center (NMC).                       Determination of the adjoint model of a particular forecast                model is a complex numerical problem.  The PI has developed a                   staged approach, working on models of increasing complexity.  At                each stage, the adjoint method for four dimensional assimilation                will be tested in cooperation with NMC scientists.  In the course               of the research, the PIs will have to develop new methods for                   dealing with problems introduced by the use of more complex                     models.  For example, determination of the adjoint models                       requires that quantities be differentiable, but certain physical                processes, such as convection, are not.                                              This research is being supported as part of an NSF-NMC                     cooperative effort to support basic research in numerical weather               prediction.",
