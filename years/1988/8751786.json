 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project features the ocean as a focus for science teacher                  enhancement.  Bowling Green State University has the unique                     facilities including an inland Marine Laboratory which provides                 the local site and expertise.  This three-year project will                     provide an opportunity for 120 elementary, middle and high                      school science teachers to study the marine environment at the                  University laboratory,as well as at Sea World of Ohio and                       Florida and compare and correlate it to the freshwater ecology                  of the area. The National Marine Fisheries Service is an                        additional supporter, both programmatically and financially of                  this project.                                                                                                                                                   All teachers will study oceanography and marine biology in the                  spring prior to the two-week summer study and field trips.  The                 latter will include trips to Lake Erie for the nearby freshwater                environment and to Orlando and Long Key in Florida to study the                 salt water environment.  Marine habitats will be observed and                   live specimens will be collected for classroom aquaria. Teachers                will be instructed in the care and maintenance of the aquaria                   and school districts have indicated support for their purchase                  and upkeep.                                                                                                                                                     A unique opportunity exists with this project not only to                       enhance the teachers in an area of science that with which they                 are not familiar, but to provide a focus for career information                 to students who have no direct connection with the oceans. The                  new knowledge, experiences and materials should improve the                     quality of science teaching. Numerous science disciplines,                      mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and geology can be                    interrelated through ocean study. This can create both an                       increased awareness among teachers and students of the ocean's                  impact on inland residents as well as a renewed understanding of                the interrelatedness of many areas of science.",
