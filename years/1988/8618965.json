 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to further develop the novel backward tracing             procedure for designing preforms utilized as starting stock in the              metal forming process.  The procedure uses capability of forward                simulation and backward tracing of a forming process by the finite              element method.  The investigator's current NSF grant has laid the              foundation for this work and has demonstrated that it is now                    possible to investigate preform design and its optimization in the              area of complex thermo-viscoplastic deformation.  Investigations are            proposed on the development of criteria and methodology, development            of the finite element method for three dimensional thermo-                      viscoplastic deformation and implementation of the backward tracing             procedure into the finite element scheme.  Specific applications of             the method which will be investigated are preform design in                     flashless axisymmetric forging and in three dimensional plate                   rolling.                                                                             The approach is novel.  The method should reduce, or eliminate             in some cases, the need of the designer's experience in the                     designing of preforms.  The proposed approach should open a new                 avenue for design in future metal forming technology.",
