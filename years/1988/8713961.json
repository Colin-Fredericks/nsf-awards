 "awd_abstract_narration": "Slag foaming plays an important role in new in-bath smelting                    processes for producing iron and in state-of-the-art electric                   furnace steelmaking; both processes will be important in future                 steelmaking  in the United States.  Most previous work on slag                  foaming simply  measured a foaming index which was the foam                     height or foam life for  arbitrary conditions.  Whereas such                    qualitative information indicates what slags may foam easily it                 gives little information concerning the basic phenomena.  The                   present experimental work will measure foaming  as a function of                slag composition, gas flow rate, slag viscosity slag surface                    tension and temperature.  The measurements will not only  include               foam height and life but also the void fraction as a function of                position, which is one of the critical parameters in any                        quantitative analysis of foaming.  The slag compositions to be                  studied will include those relative to in-bath smelting and                     electric  furnace steelmaking.  The effects of small                            concentrations of surface  active elements such as P2O5, and of                 suspended second phase particles will also be investigated.  The                foaming of the slags will be  correlated to the properties of the               slag and, the equations for the  conservation of mass, momentum                 and energy will be used to generalize  the behavior.  A new model               concerned with foam life will also be  tested.  The surface                     tension of the slags will be determined if no  such information                 exists for that particular slag.  In addition, the  rate of                     nitrogen transfer through a foamed slag and its reaction with                   liquid iron will be measured.",
