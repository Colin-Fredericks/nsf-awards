 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues a curricular plan initiated in 1985 to              improve undergraduate learning in anatomy and physiology.  The plan             began with an institutional grant that provided computer software               development to augment the anatomy-physiology lecture series.  The              Science Division developed a microcomputer laboratory with eight Apple          2E microcomputers, color monitors, disk drives and an Apple printer.            A pilot study of computerized data acquisition in physiology                    laboratories proved to attract student interest.  Further                       investigations and an actual on-campus Intelitool demonstration                 preceded the developmental work that led to this grant.                                                                                                              The primary objective of the current phase of the project is to            interface computer technology with the biology laboratory by using the          Intelitool computerized system and programmable calculators.  The               Intelitool system stimulates experimental inquiry and research by               providing data acquisition and analysis using Cardiocomp, Physiogrip,           Spirocomp, and Flexicomp packages.  Creative laboratory experiments             are designed to maximize critical thinking and analysis.  Additional            printers provide students with print-outs of graphs and data sheets.            Programmed calculators enhance statistical analysis and increase time           devoted to the interpretation of actual data.  Besides improving the            physiology curriculum, this project also is expected to encourage               student interest in scientific research, increase the number of                 students going on to graduate work in science (including women and              minorities), and expose science student teachers to modern                      computerized laboratory technology.                                                                                                                                  The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
