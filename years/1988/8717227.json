 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project began as an attempt to establish the                       systematics of the stable isotopes of Be and Al in the oceans                   with a view to using their cosmogenic radio-isotopes as                         geochronologic tools.  There is an explicit analogy here to C-                  14.  Carbon is involved in the biogeochemical cycle; hence the                  effect of decay on the distribution of the radio-isotope is                     overprinted by non-radiogenic processes.  However the stable                    isotope C-12 is affected only by the biogenic processes and                     hence can be used to correct for their effects on the radio-                    isotope.  The success of this approach is greatly facilitated                   by the fact that the carbon isotopes share a common, well-mixed                 reservior, the atmosphere.  The latter is known not to be the                   case for Be and Al.  The objective of this project is to                        establish whether the residence time and chemical behaviours of                 these elements in seawater is such that isotope equilibrium is                  achieved in the oceanic reserviour.  If this were true then                     direct radiometric dating of marine sediments would be feasible                 in the range 0 to - 15 million years.                                                                                                                                   Support is requested to continue investigations of the                  geochemical cycles of the isotopes of Be and Al with a view to                  developing them as geochronometers.  It is proposed to                          participate in the South Atlantic Ventilation Experiment                        expedition to extend coverage into the South Atlantic and to                    examine the evolution of the isotope distributions as the                       Atlantic water masses propagate from their northern sources                     areas.  Support is also requested for collaboration with                        Raisebeck's group in Orsay in a delineation of the continental                  cycles of the Be isotopes using our expertise and his dedicated                 Be-10 accelerator.",
