 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reverse transcription plays a key role in virus replication                     and quite possibly in other genomoic arrangements, hence it                     is desirable to fully understand it. One of the enzymes                         involved is DNA endonuclease (pp32).  Dr. Grandgenett has                       found that pp32 phosphorylated and he now hopes to locate the                   phosphorylated sites.  Labeling studies indicate that the                       three serines in the COOH-terminal one-third of pp32 are                        phosphorylated.  The exact location of the serine will be                       established and the biological significance of each                             phosphorylated site defined.  The biological significance of                    this phosphorylation will be assessed by generation of                          modified p-SER sites by oligonucleotide mutagenesis of                          infectious cloned Prague A DNA.  This should permit the                         alignment of phosphorylation to a defect at the molecular                       level.  Attempts will be made to define what biological                         properties are associated with the pp32 expressed in cells by                   several eucaryotic vectors constructed under the previous                       grant.  Since the amino acid sequence of pp32 is highly                         conserved in pol of certain eucaryotic transposons, defining                    the properties of pp32 intracellularly may be beneficial in                     understanding these mobile genetic units.  The investigator                     is one of the few individuals working in this area using a                      biochemical approach and thus this project merits a high                        priority for funding.",
