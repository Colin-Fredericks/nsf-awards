 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the last ten years, electron energy-loss spectroscopy                    (EELS) has been combined with transmission electron microscopy to               yield a method of chemical microanalysis which is capable of very               high spatial resolution.  Such methods are needed in the                        development of improved catalysts, the characterization of small                particles in steel, and in studies ofthe distribution of calcium                and other light elements in biological tissue.                                                                                                                  A simple and convenient quantitation procedure has been developed               for EELS, but this procedure can give misleading results from                   some specimens, particularly if the regions analysed are                        crystalline.  Purpose of this research is to develop an improved                analysis routine and more accurate models for ionization cross                  sections.  To achieve this aim, energy-loss spectroscopy on test                samples of known thickness and composition will be carried out.                 As a result of these efforts, it is expected that EELS will come                closer to fulfilling its potential as a microanalysis technique.                                                                                                EELS will also be used to investigate the radiation-induced loss                of light elements from electron-irradiated areas; in particular,                its dependence on specimen temperature and surface coating.  With               greater use being made on high-brightness electron sources and                  higher accelerating voltages, this mass-loss process is of                      increasing importance to any electron-beam microanalysis                        technique, including x-ray emission spectroscopy.",
