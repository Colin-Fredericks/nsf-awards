 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sea urchin eggs will be used as a system to examine the cellular                mechanisms that regulate the actin cytoskeleton. Following                      fertilization, the egg undergoes definable changes in its actin                 cytoskeleton in almost perfect synchrony with a series of defined               metabolic and ionic changes.  The proposed experiments wil examine the          in vitro effects of three calcium-sensitive actin binding proteins (egg         spectrin, egg 95K, and egg 50K) on actin filament assembly and                  structure.  Polyclonal antibodies monospecific for these proteins will          be generated and used for indirect immunofluorescence to examine the            spatio-temporal relationship between the actin binding proteins and             actin within oocytes, eggs, and embryos.  The antibodies will also be           used to examine tissue specific expression of the actin binding                 proteins.  If necessary, monoclonal antibodies will be generated to             pursue this work.                                                                 The long term goals of this project are to establish insight into how         cells are able to maintain and modulate their actin cytoskeletons with          such amazing precision.  This is fundamentally important, because the           microfilament systems of virtually all eucaryotic cell types are                crucial to the proper cytoplasmic and membranous organization (and              hence function) of the cells.",
