 "awd_abstract_narration": "How spatially-mapped information (in the brain) can be                     transformed into temporally ordered patterns of movement is the                 long term objective of the research program headed up by Dr.                    David Ingle.  To achieve this end he is currently using                         amphibians and doing detailed kinematic analysis of components of               feeding and avoidance behaviors.  He will undertake new                         anatomical studies of the presumed neural substrate of these                    behaviors.  Through an analysis of behavioral deficits produced                 by lesions of certain brain structures he can test current                      hypotheses as to how particular components of prey-catching and                 avoidance behaviors are related to components of specific brain                 neural projections.  This work is important because Dr. Ingle is                working on the lower brainstem of vertebrates and little analysis               is available regarding these neural circuits  and their                         relationship to directed movements.  The analysis of sensory                    control of orienting behaviors in vertebrates is the expertise of               Dr. Ingle and the work to be performed should greatly increase                  our knowledge in this field.",
