The objectives of this program are to provide research support to               the Nation's most outstanding and promising young science and                   engineering faculty.  The awards are intended to improve the                    capability of U.S. academic institutions to respond to the demand               for highly qualified science and engineering personnel for                      academic and industrial research and teaching. This award will                  allow the investigator to pursue his research in the application                of social network ideas to issues in organizational theory and                  political sociology.  Much of his work focuses on the behavior of               large corporations.  He is interested in the factors that                       determine the types of government policies supported by                         businesses.  Dr. Mizruchi's focus is on the ways in which factors               such as market constraint exerted by one firm over another and                  the number of common institutional shareholders determine whether               a pair of firms will support the same policy.  He is also                       concerned with the methods corporations use to handle their                     capital needs.  The focus is on whether representatives of                      financial institutions join the boards of nonfinancial                          corporations when the latter are in financial difficulty, as well               as the types of alternatives that are available to capital-                     dependent firms and the factors that influence how capital is                   raised.",
