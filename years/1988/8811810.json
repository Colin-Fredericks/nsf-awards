 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the question of how children arrive at the               intuitions adults have about the relative acceptability of                      complex words. It aims to do so by systematic exploration of                    various characteristics of word-formation processes (e.g.,                      phonological, semantic, etymological, frequency, blocking) that                 might be significant in the child's lexical induction.  The                     primary methodologies will be use of sentence completion,                       compound formation, lexical decision, and picture matching. Much                of research to date on lexical acquisition focuses on when                      children acquire word-formation rules such as compounding and                   affixation, but it is as yet unclear how such processes fit into                the developing structure of the lexicon itself.  The data from                  this project, evaluated within the framework of current                         linguistic models of lexical structure, will provide a unified                  account of a variety of word-formation processes and suggest ways               in which structure might develop within the child's lexicon.",
