 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nostoc commune is a nitrogen-fixing photosynthetic cyanobacterium               with the capacity for desiccation-tolerance.  This microorganism                grows freely as single filaments (seriate growth) or in                         aggregates where filamentous organization of the cells is                       indistinct (aseriate growth).  Cells of the aseriate type express               a pronounced tolerance to extremes of water stress and accumulate               massive amounts of a class of soluble acidic proteins when they                 are subjected to repeated cycles of drying and rehydration.  One                of these water stress (Wsp) proteins is a glycoprotein, two                     others are intimately associated with carbohydrate(s).  The aims                of this project are to purify and characterize biochemically the                Wsp proteins and associated carbohydrates, understand how the                   synthesis of the proteins is controlled by water stress, and to                 discover the role of Wsp proteins in desiccation tolerance.                     Techniques used in this study involve semi-continuous and                       synchronized growth of cells in a fermenter, immobilization and                 growth of cells on inert solid supports, protein purification,                  protein A-gold immunolabelling, and assays for nitrogen fixation                including the detection of nifH mRNA in cells subjected to water                stress.                                                                                                                                                         There is no consensus of opinion on the sequence of events that                 leads to the suppression of plant growth by waterstress.  The                   objective of this work is to contribute to our understanidng of                 desiccation tolerance.  Consequently, the work is significant in                view of the extent to which water deficits impinge upon the                     success of managed agriculture as well as the fundamental                       importance of water in gene expression.",
