 "awd_abstract_narration": "This model project was developed by the National Center on Deafness at          California State University, Northridge.  During the first year,                learning experiences are being provided for elementary, junior high and         senior high students to stimulate their interest in science and                 technology by providing deaf students with enhanced access to existing          programs through the provision of interpreting sersvices.  The emphasis         on existing programs is to minimize redundancy while providing deaf             students with access to mainstream programs.  Plans for the second year         and beyond will focus on reducing the attrition among deaf students at          the postsecondary level.  This will be accomplished by providing more           intensive interpreting, notetaking and tutorial services for deaf               students at California State University, Northridge.  Additional                services, provided in the form of specialized training for                      interpreters, will be made available to regional junior colleges.  This         will facilitate access to science and technology for deaf students on           those campuses.",
