 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. Rik Wanninkhof of Lamont-Doherty Geological             Observatory to collaborate with Dr. Bernd Jaehne of the Institute of            Environmental Physics of the University of Heidelberg in a study of             the influence of waves on gas exchange at the air - water                       interface.  The initial phase of the research will be performed in              an unusually large wind-wave tunnel in Delft, Holland; its great                size will permit generation of high wind speeds and breaking waves.             Drs. Wanninkhof and Jaehne will capitalize on an opportunity to add             their experiments to an ongoing Dutch research program, VIERS, which            was originally designed simply to study the effect of waves on the              backscatter signal of radar beams directed at the water surface.                Dr. Jaehne will measure heat and gas fluxes across the interface                using 3He and 4He.  Dr. Wanninkhof will perform gas exchange                    measurements of several compounds of biogeochemical significance:               methane, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, plus sulfur hexafluoride             (a tracer gas).  The Dutch groups are obtaining extensive physical              data on wave form, surface tension, water viscosity, etc., which are            necessary complements to the gas exchange measurements.                                                                                                         Much effort has been put into quantifying the relationship between              gas exchange and wind speed, since it is expected that a                        disproportionate amount of gas flux occurs in high wind conditions,             where, for example, breaking waves are generated.  The exchange of              gases between the ocean and the atmosphere is still poorly                      understood due to the difficulty of measuring the process in the                field in anything but very calm water.  This collaborative project              is the first time that surface water turbulence, which regulates the            rate of gas exchange, will be well characterized at the same time               that gas exchange measurements are made in a wind driven system.",
