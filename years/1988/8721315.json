 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will document the magnitude, rates and relative              timing of change among numerous isotopic (18O, 13C, 87Sr/86Sr)                  and elemental (Li/A1) tracers through the Devono-Carboniferous                  interval.  This period in Earth's history, which is marked by a                 dramatic shift in 18O and 13C of marine carbonates records either               a dramatic decrease in global surface temperature of 30-40                      degree, or an enrichment in 18O composition of seawater.  Paired                analysis of chemical tracers will be performed on non-biological                marine carbonates from Devono-Carboniferous reefal sequences of                 the Dinant Synclinorium (Belgium) - Waulsortian Sequence of                     Ireland and the time equivalent succession of the Alberta Basin to              test the hypothesis that a shift in ocean 18O composition was                   caused by an increase in 18O flux associated with enhanced                      hydrothermal alteration at submarine spreading ridges.                               Analysis of 87Sr/86Sr variation will provide insight on                    relative contributions from mantle versus crustal sources; Li/Al                ratios will record the increasing versus decreasing dominance of                high temperature, hydrothermal alteration versus low temperature                submarine weathering of mantle-derived basalts.  Specific goals of              the research include:  (1) evaluation of correlations, in time and              magnitude, of variation among chemical tracers to determine                     whether they are responding to a common geologic process; (2)                   determination of empirical time constants of change in chemistry                to constrain the magnitude of elemental fluxes into an out of the               ocean; and (3) quantitative modelling, based on empirical                       relationships, to assess the role of seawater cycling through mid-              ocean ridge basalt in defining the 18O composition of the                       paleocean.",
