 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides students with training in real-time computer           control using a hardware/software environment that supports concurrency         and distributed processing.                                                                                                                                        The programming training received by most computer science                   undergraduates does not lend itself to application to real-time                 control of complicated systems. Curricula are changing to meet the need         for programmers who can function in a systems control environment.              However, too frequently students must be satisfied with learning about          theoretical models without seeing those models applied to real                  problems. Also, many theoretical models gloss over some practical               issues having to do with the control environment.                                                                                                                  This project not only exposes students to state-of-the-art software          development tools for real-time systems control, but it also provides           them with a flexible physical test-bed for their programs.
