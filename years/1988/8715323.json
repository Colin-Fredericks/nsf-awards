 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between                          Prof. Arthur Bienenstock of the Stanford Synchrotron                            Radiation Laboratory (SSRL), and Drs. Genevieve                                 Loupias and Jerome Tarbes of the Laboratoire de                                 Mineralogie-Crystallographie of the Universite de                               Paris, in the area of high-intensity X-ray Compton                              scattering.  The objective of this work is to utilize                           the high-intensity X-rays emitted by synchrotron                                radiation from the beam lines on the PEP storage ring                           at SSRL to perform very high resolution electron                                momentum density measurements using Compton                                     scattering.  Achievement of this objective requires                             design and construction of an energy-dispersive                                 detection apparatus optimized for detection at                                  energies near that of the scattered X-rays;                                     calibration of this apparatus by measurements on                                previously studied materials at higher resolution than                          has been previously possible; and, finally, the study                           of complex systems such as the transition metals above                          and below the Curie temperature.                                                                                                                                The French collaborators have considerable experience                           with high-resolution Compton scattering, which should                           assure that the SSRL facilities are equipped for these                          measurements in a relatively short time.  Following                             the installation of the detectors, the U.S. and French                          groups will study different materials: the U.S. group                           will investigate elemental semiconductors and metals,                           while the French group will study both natural and                              artificial layered structures.  The two groups will                             jointly analyze the results obtained, and although                              measurements will be made at SSRL, some data analysis                           will take place in France.  The research will advance                           the technique of Compton scattering itself, and will                            provide a resource for high-resolution scattering                               measurements to the scientific community at large.",
