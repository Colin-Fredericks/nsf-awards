 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since the invention of low-loss optical fiber, to increase the                  communication capability in a fiber channel has been the goal of much           scientific effort.  In a conventional fiber channel, either single-             mode or multiple-mode, the bit-rate is usually limited to below 50 MHz          with frequent use of electronic repeators.  Recently, the coherent              detection was developed in a fiber channel.  This development can               raise the bit-rate up to several GHz.  However, in a coherent                   communication system, the limitation on communication capability due            to dispersion effects still exists.  The discovery of soliton                   propagation creates a new possiblity for increasing the bit-rate to             over 100 GHz with a long fiber length (up to 1000 km) without using an          electronic repeator.                                                                                                                                            The major problem is to investigate from the propagation viewpoint the          possibility of applying the multi-channel wavelength-division-                  mutiplexed technique to a soliton-based fiber communication system.             In this problem, two important considerations are to be studied.                The first issue is the mutual interaction among the pulse trains of             different channels. These interactions include at least the                     cross-phase moduation and Raman conversion.  The shapes and                     propagation speeds of the pulses insuch a multiple-channel fiber will           be changed.  The second issue is the Raman compensation for linear              loss in such a multiple-channel system.  It is likely to achieve an             optimal compensation for multiple channels by including the Raman               conversions                                                                     among different channels.",
