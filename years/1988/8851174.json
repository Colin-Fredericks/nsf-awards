 "awd_abstract_narration": "This department stresses a program of quantitative training to             help undergraduates develop skills necessary for biologists and                 environmental scientists in the next decade.  A Perkin-Elmer 5100               Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer-Graphite furnace (AA-GF) system             with Zeeman background correction is facilitating instruction in                Biology Department programs, including Environmental Sciences,                  Toxicology, Microbiology, and Botany, and is encouraging development of         more interdisciplinary undergraduate courses and projects.                                                                                                           The AA and GF are essential tools for the quantification of                metals in a variety of matrices.  Projects have been designed in five           courses to instruct students in the theory, advantages, limitations,            and proper uses of AA and GF.  Instrumentation maintenance and quality          control/quality assurance procedures are an integral part of all                courses and projects.  Student projects involve use of the AA and,              where appropriate, the FA as detectors of metal contaminants in water,          soil/sediments, biological fluids, tissues, and air.  They also are             used to measure bioaccumulation of metals in terrestrial/greenhouse             studies and to monitor the levels of toxic metals added to tissue               cultures for chronic and acutetoxicity testing.  Research and                   development of new methods for use of the GF and AA should give                 complete instruction of uses, advantages, and limitations of these              tools.                                                                                                                                                               The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
