 "awd_abstract_narration": "Isotopic and trace element signatures in basaltic rocks from            hotspot areas hold the key to the understanding of an important                 phenomenon, that is plume in the mantle.  Mantle plums are                      believed to have created hot spots on the globe and with                        subsequent volcanism formed many sea mount chains.  In this                     award, the principal investigator will analyze rocks from Cobb-                 Eickelberg seamount chain which is a product of near ridge hot                  spot activity and rocks from Marquesas islands formed by                        intraplate hot spot activity. These two localities are differnt                 in their geologic settings.  the objective  is to determine the                 hot spot structures, heterogeneity and the extent of lithospheric               assimilation during melt production at these locations.  This                   research will help us to understand mantle geochemistry at hot                  spot areas.  Dr. Duncan is an excellent researcher with an                      established track record and the chance of success in this                      project is very high.",
