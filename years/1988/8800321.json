 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interaction of the solar wind with ionized gas confined                by the earth's magnetic field results in a long extension                       downwind to many earth radii of the magnetic field and gas (the                 magnetosphere) and the generation of currents of millions of                    amperes which flow through the high latitude ionosphere, and                    create the striking displays of light emission known as the                     aurora.  This award is for the continuation of a cooperative                    observation and analysis program called GISMOS, of which several                successful campaigns have taken place, using radar and optical                  and magnetic field measuring equipment to determine the pattern                 of electric field associated with the currents and auroral                      emissions.  The objective is to advance our understanding of the                physical processes involved in the sudden release of energy                     previously accumulated in the magnetosphere by the solar wind-                  magnetosphere interaction, part of which is deposited in the                    ionosphere and is known as a magnetic substorm.",
