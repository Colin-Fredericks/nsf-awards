 "awd_abstract_narration": "The glow of the upper atmosphere at night (the airglow) can                be seen with the naked eye from sites with very dark skies as the               faint light from between the stars.  Its spectrum is that of                    recombining molecular fragments.  This airglow and its wave-like                variations are an indication of the deposition of energy in the                 upper atmosphere.  From above, the direct solar ultraviolet                     radiation and particle precipitation driven by the solar wind are               the major sources, while chemical transport from below is                       modified by planetary waves, gravity waves and tides, that are                  seen as quasi-periodic variations in the range from minutes to                  days, and occurring for hours to tens of days at a time.  This                  award is for observations of the airglow at a high latitude                     station (Alaska), to identify the solar cycle, seasonal, diurnal                and sporadic variations, due to the coupling from above and                     below, and to relate them to numerical models of the chemistry                  and dynamics.  To understand these processes is an important                    part of the ultimate description of the flow of energy from the                 sun to the earth.",
