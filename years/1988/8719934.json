 "awd_abstract_narration": "Almost every object one sees is visually incomplete in the sense                that at least part of it is hidden from view by its own visible                 surfaces and/or by those of closer objects.  This project will                  study how people's visual systems accomplish this task.  The                    research will employ the \"primed matching paradigm\", in which                   people match two figures, as quickly as possible, for physical                  identity shortly after seeing an initial \"priming\" display that                 depicts a figure partly hidden from view.  The pattern of                       response times to different shapes in this task can then be used                to infer how people have completed the image of the hidden object               in the priming display.  The results should be useful in                        answering questions about the process of visual completion and in               constraining theories about how that process unfolds in time.                   Such questions include the following:  (1) How long does the                    completion process take?  (2) How \"completely\" are objects                      completed?  (3) Are the texture and color of the object completed               as well as its shape?  (4) What factors influence the way that                  shapes are completed?  This methodology can be extended to                      questions concerning other important problems of visual                         perception, such as how people see depth in scenes and how they                 perceive the transparency of objects.",
