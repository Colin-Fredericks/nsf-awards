 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Duke University Marine Laboratory has requested several items of            oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use              equipment.  This equipment is maintained for use on or in association           with the R/V CAPE HATTERAS, a research vessel owned by the NSF and              operated by Duke University.  A substantial part of the ship's                  operating schedule during 1988 is in support of NSF-sponsored research          projects.  The instrumentation will also increase the capabilities of           the ship and of the institution to support research and engineering             activities.  The instrumentation includes:                                                                                                                      -shipboard computer for the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler,                  -additions to the SAIL shipboard data logging system,                           -a deep water CTD system for collecting precision temperature and                conductivity data as a function of depth,                                      -digital data recording system for seismic system, and                          -additional spare circuit boards and parts.                                                                                                                     The instrumentation described above will increase the capability of             the organization to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering              projects.",
