 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in polymer materials             between Professor Hirotsugu Yasuda, University of Missouri-Rolla                and Dr. Carl-Gustav Golander, Surface Chemistry Institute,                      Stockholm, Sweden.  The interactions between solid surfaces can be              directly measured as the force acting between two surfaces, and the             data obtained by such measurements provide very important                       information pertinent to many applications of materials in which                surface plays a crucially important role.  Heretofore the                       measurement has been limited to freshly cleaved mica surface and                modified surfaces of mica.  Because of the inertness of the mica                surface, the modifications of the surface is rather limited to thin             film applications, such as by adsorption and Langmuir-Blodgett                  deposition techniques.  In order to broaden the scope of the                    surface force measurement, it is intended in this joint project to              utilize the ultra-thin film deposition technique known as plasma                polymerization, which provides new kinds of surfaces with improved              adhesion characteristics.  Plasma polymers have surface                         characteristics of low mobility due to the absence of long chain                segments, which are significantly different from those of                       conventional polymers with highly mobile macromolecules.  Plasma                polymers are believed to be ideally suited for the study of surface             forces.                                                                                                                                                         The Swedish Institute for Surface Chemistry has one of the most                 productive groups working in the area of surface force                          measurements.  In addition, the surface force measuring apparatus               developed by J.N. Israelachvili has been installed since 1983 in                this Swedish institute.  Professor Yasuda has extensive experience              in plasma polymerization and its application in surface                         modifications.  He will gain an opportunity to investigate surfaces             of plasma deposited polymeric materials with the help of Swedish                expertise in surface chemistry.",
