 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC) will develop an            unusual \"hands-on\" training program in exhibit development for science          museum staff.  This four year program will strengthen the exhibition            capabilities of small and medium-sized science museums throughout the US        through a series of workshops and intensive cooperation between ASTC            staff, \"teaching museums,\" design consultants, and four \"learner                museums\" that will lead to the creation of four finished exhibitions.           Training will be managed by ASTC's existing Traveling Exhibits Service          staff, assisted by a Project Advisory Committee and several nationally          recognized exhibition consultants.                                                                                                                              The project will result in four l,000 square foot traveling exhibits            that will reach more than 2,000,000 visitors at more than 30 museums,           four permanent exhibits at the learner museums, and professional                training and consultation in exhibit development for more than 30               museums staff, including long term training of staff from the four              learner museums.  NSF support will be augmented by $200,000 contributed         by the learner museums.",
