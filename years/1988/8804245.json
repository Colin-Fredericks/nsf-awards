 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eight undergraduate geology students will spend the summer                 doing research at the Department of Geology at the College of                   William and Mary.  Library research, field work, and laboratory                 investigation will be combined in each project to give students a               broad range of experience.  The emphasis will be on indepencent                 work by the students under the guidance and in the direct field                 of interest of the research supervisors, and each student will                  have his or her own research project to work on.  The research                  accomplishments of each student will be presented in a formal                   written report and the students will also be encouraged to                      present their findings at a professional meeting.                                    Research projects willbe on the geology of the Coastal                     Plain, Piedmont, and Valley and Ridge provinces of Virginia.                    Coastal Plain projects may be on paleoecologic studies,                         environmental studies on groundwater contamination and pollution                of lakes, and investigation of karst development.  Piedmont                     projects may be on the petrology of granite of diabase, and the                 structure and stratigraphy of the Triassic Richmond Basin.                      Valley and Ridge projects may study concretions and limestore                   beds in Devonian shales, cyclic sedimentation in Ordovician                     limestones, and detailed structure of a thrust fault.",
