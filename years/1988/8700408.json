 "awd_abstract_narration": "The majority of plants produce both male and female flowers.            Some 5% of plants, however, have separate male and female                       individuals, a condition known as \"dioecy\".  Dioecy shows up in                 all sorts of unrelated species, raising the possibility that                    there is some underlying mechanism common to these independent                  evolutionary transitions from hermaphroditism to dioecy.  Several               explanations have been offered.  What is lacking is information                 from natural populations concerning whether any of these                        explanations actually apply.  That is the target of this project.               Dr. Muenchow has identified a situation in the genus Sagittaria                 where, among a set of near relatives, she finds both                            hermaphrodites and dioecious plants.  This allows her to compare                the two forms under very similar field conditions, and to                       determine whether the ecological conditions that the various                    hypotheses assume actually seem to apply to this genus.                                 The work is important to developing an understanding of                 evolutionary processes.  In this particular case, theoretical                   development has outstripped experimental evidence.  The                         experiment evidence this project provides will, therefore,                      rapidly influence further theoretical work and form an integral                 part of an ongoing scientific \"discussion\".",
