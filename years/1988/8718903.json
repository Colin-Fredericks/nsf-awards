 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transcriptional enhancer of SV40 is the prototype mammalian                 enhancer and is the most extensively analyzed.  Genetic analyses                of this enhancer in African Green Monkey Kidney (AGMk) cells have               shown that it consists of at least three separate elements each                 of which can function in cooperation with one another or                        duplicates of themselves to enhance transcription.  To date these               genetic experiments have been limited to AGMK cells; it is                      probable that the SV40 enchancer contains additional elements                   that have been overlooked because they do not function                          effectively in AGMK cells.  This possibility will be explored by                performing genetic analyses in various cell types.  This will be                accomplished by replacing the enhancer region of the murine                     papovavirus polyoma with the wild-type SV40 enhancer and/or                     previously characterized SV40 enhancer mutants.  These                          polyoma/SV40 enhancer recombinant will be used to select for                    variants with improved growth in a variety of different murine                  cell types including fibroblast, lymphocytes, and embryonal                     carcinoma cells.  Differing patterns of enhancer rearrangement                  should be obtained depending on the cell line used which will                   allow identification of elements displaying different cell-                     specific activities.  This project will lead towards a clear                    description of the complex array of different elements within the               SV40 enhancer.",
