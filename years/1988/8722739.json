 "awd_abstract_narration": "The powerful new tool of comparing molecules to show                       evolutionary relationships will be used in studying freshwater                  and marine green algae, including those green algae thought to be               most closely related to the land plants.  A comparison of the                   ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules from cytoplasmic ribosomes will                offer a new and exciting perspective on questions that have been                the focus of research attention for more than a century.  Other                 modern approaches, such as electron microscopy, have provided                   major revisions of the classification of green algae, revisions                 that can now be tested by molecular analysis.  The comparison of                cytoplasmic ribosomal RNA molecules of green algae also will                    provide a major basis for comparison to similar studies of the                  molecular evolution of the chloroplasts of green algae, an                      evolution that may be different from that of the cytoplasmic                    ribosomal RNAs.  Also, this study will be a model for and                       parallel to studies of other major groups of algae including red                and brown algae, the diatoms, and the dinoflagellates.                               In this project portions of the 18s and 26s ribosomal RNA                  molecules will be sequenced directly (by dideoxynucleotide primer               extension).  The massive data set will be stored, aligned,                      compared, and analyzed with various computer programs.  Cladistic               analysis of the data will provide the basis for inferring the                   ancient lineages and patterns of divergences for the green algae.               The \"family trees\" produced will be contrasted with those based                 on morphological, ultrastructural, and biochemical characters.                  Computer-assisted cladistic analysis of ribosomal RNA data in                   combination with non-molecular information will provide an                      important synthesis of different types of information and thus,                 should help us develop a natural system of classification for the               green algae and a better understanding of the algal origins of                  land plants.",
