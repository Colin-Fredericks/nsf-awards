 "awd_abstract_narration": "The response of rigid frame structures constructed of glass fiber               reinforced plastic (FRP) pultruded profile sections will be                     investigated.  The experimental program will examine the behavior of            full-sized structural frames under short term loading to failure and            under long term loading in which creep deformation will be                      significant.  Strain gages, rosettes, and dial indicators will be               used to monitor the strains and deformations in the  frames.                    Hydraulic jacks and dead weights will be used to load the frames.               The theoretical program will account for the anisotropic and                    viscoelastic properties of the material and develop a code to analyze           both the short term nonlinear response and the long term creep                  response. The analysis of the frame will include the effects of shear           deformation which is known to be significant in composite thin-walled           beams.  The theoretically predicted forces and deflections will be              compared with those measured experimentally.  The results of this               investigation should provide important data which will be used to               develop future methodologies of analysis and design with standardized           pultruded fiber reinforced plastics.",
