 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is the contention of this project that the theory of local                   public finance is based on a misspecified \"production function\"                 for local services--one that omits the important role that                      community characteristics play in determining levels of public                  output.  This misspecification has both important positive and                  normative implications.  The positive implications concerning                   biased estimates of price and income elasticities have been the                 subject of some attention in the literature.  But the normative                 implications have been largely ignored.  In particular, the                     central results of the Tiebout model, namely that an optimal                    system of jurisdiction is characterized by communities that are                 homogeneous in the demand for local services, no longer holds in                a world in which community composition is an important                          determinant of outputs of local public goods.                                                                                                                   This study develops a general theory of local finance in a                      setting where community composition influences local public                     outputs.  The focus here is determining how the optimal                         composition of local jurisdictions depends on the interaction of                individuals in the provision of local public goods.  This project               investigates in econometric terms the production function of                    public safety.  It uses existing data sets to explore the form of               the relationship between community composition and the levels of                public safety.  Finally, a series of simulation studies are made                using specific utility and production functions to examine the                  optimal structure of local jurisdictions where community                        composition matters in the production of local services.",
