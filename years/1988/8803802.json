 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research, undertaken in collaboration with Robert D. Rodman                of North Carolina State University at Raleigh, is concerned with                the problem of how to interact with a computer system in natural                language by voice.  It continues and builds on the results of                   research carried out by the investigators over the past seven                   years.  Working in the problem domain of electronic equipment                   repair, they are currently investigating a range of interactive                 modes from \"passive\" (the computer merely follows orders and ans-               wers questions) to \"directive\" (it takes charge and questions and               instructs the human user).  They are also investigating the nat-                ure and role of comments in a task-oriented dialog and ways of                  representing and generating appropriate, fully grammatical, natu-               ral language spoken responses.                                                                                                                                  The motivating goal of the research is to be able to design a                   machine partner, capable of natural language voice dialogue, and                able to assist human beings of varying abilities and experience                 in an electronic repair task.  Progress toward this goal contrib-               utes in important ways to knowledge of how to employ automata in                roles previously possible only for skilled human beings.",
