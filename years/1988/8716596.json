 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a continuing series of                     conference/workshops focusing on problems and advances in the                   theory of partial differential equations.  The meetings are                     hosted by various midwestern institutions on a rotating basis.                  Two principal speakers are invited, often from outside the                      region.  Six additional talks are also scheduled.                                    These spring-fall meetings date back to 1977 and have                      admirably fulfilled their goals of bringing together researchers                for intensive discussions twice each year.  In addition, graduate               students are urged to attend.  Many researchers go to great                     lengths to see that these students have transportation and                      lodging.  Attendance is now between 70 and 80 mathematicians.                   Many do not ask for support, keeping the total cost to an                       absolute minimum.                                                                    The breadth of strength and interest in partial differential               equations in the region is truly impressive.  Areas ranging from                numerical simulations of turbulence to abstract equations in                    several complex variables can be represented at any meeting.  The               activity has measurably contributed to the health of mathematics                in the region.",
