 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant, funded jointly by Special Projects in Chemistry and                 the Division of Materials Research provides support for the                     collaborative research of Prof. Haggarty in Materials Science                   and Engineering and Prof. Seyferth in Chemistry at the                          Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The objective of the                     research is the study of the direct synthesis of inorganic                      materials in their final forms from polymeric organometallic                    precursors.                                                                                                                                                     The research program closely couples materials synthesis                        (Seyferth) and materials characterization (Haggarty).                           Non-oxide ceramic materials for structured applications have                    been selected from the many possible choices for chemistries                    and optimized properties. This combination will serve as a                      model for other classes of ceramic materials and applications.                  The synthesis program will involve both established and new                     sythetic routes which give products readily amenable to                         characterization and property measurements. Reaction kinetics,                  product intermediates and dimensional changes will be                           determined during the pyrolysis reactions using several                         advanced analytical techniques.                                                                                                                                 The characterization portion of the research program has three                  broad objectives.  The first is to provide measurements and                     observations which will enable the design of synthetic                          procedures phenomenologically and mechanistically.  The second                  is to make property measurements necessary to evaluate the                      potential of these materials in specific applications.                          Density, pore-size, surface area, microstructure, bulk                          composition, microscale composition, surface composition,                       bonding, crystallinity, strength, hardness and toughness will                   be characterized.  The third integrates the results of the                      other two; the relationship between synthesis process variables                 and properties will be determined. Each of the microstructural                  and chemical characteristics influences the final properties.                   The third defines the limitations, if any, that this polymeric                  precursor processing route places on fabrication techniques,                    part dimensions and/or resulting properties.",
