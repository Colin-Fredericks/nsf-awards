 "awd_abstract_narration": "The new instruments provided through this award, along with                equipment already held by the department, is supporting the                     creation of an important new central laboratory facility for                    teaching cellular biology.  The facility serves seven upper                     biology component.  Of these courses, four use the facility on a                full-time basis; the remaining three courses utilize the facility               on a pre-arranged academic schedule to conduct laboratory                       exercises which require cell biology instrumentation.                                                                                                                The new equipment is being used for the preparation and                    analysis of living cells.  Major items include laminar flow                     hoods, a fluorescence microscope, an infrared gas analyzer, and a               scanning spectrophotometer.  As a direct result of the                          acquisition of this equipment, the core curriculum in cell                      biology is being substantially upgraded.  The project permits the               development of new cell biology experiments, lower division                     demonstrations, and the improvement of existing lab exercises.                  These improvements are bringing stte-or-the-art techniques to the               curriculum and reinforcing the teaching of modern cell biology                  principles, thus better preparing undergraduates for future jobs                and/or graduate studies.  The grantee is matching the NSF award                 with a slightly greater sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
