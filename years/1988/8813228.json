 "awd_abstract_narration": "The grant is to provide funds for travel of several United                States scientists to attend the MRS International Meeting on                    Advanced Materials (Tokyo, Japan, May 30 through June 3, 1988).                 This meeting is the first of its kind and will occur as a result                of a new and unique collaborative interchange among materials                   scientists from the United States and Japan.  Participation by                  scientists from the United States in this meeting will enhance                  the effectiveness of the meeting itself, will provide the most                  efficient conduct for transfer of scientific and technological                  knowledge from Japan to the United States (as well as from the                  United States to Japan), and will establish many contacts for                   future collaborative research across international boundaries.                                                                                                        The topics of research being discussed at the meeting                     include:  composites, rapid quenching processing, powder                        preparation, superconductivity, superplasticity, joining of                     ceramics and metals, multilayer materials, magnetic materials,                  biomaterials, photoresponsive polymers, biosensors, advanced                    ceramics, and calalytic materials.  In some of these topics, the                Japanese are more advanced than the United States, and                          collaborative research will represent a transfer of knowledge to                the United States.  The United States scientists involved are                   the leaders in their respective scientific fields.",
