 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is a continuation of the Research Experiences For               Undergraduates site that was run at Oregon State last summer.                   Although the Principal Investigator's plan to be flexible, they                 have also established some carefully defined research projects                  for the students.  They will work individually or as teams on                   projects involving computer exploration of number theory,                       numerical and population dynamics, percolation models, and other                similar projects.  The projects are intended to introduce                       participants to methods of mathematical research and to emphasize               the use of experimentation, computation, and teamwork as means of               attacking complex problems.  They also seek to give participants                tools which are playing increasingly important roles in modern                  mathematics.  Participants will work closely with the principal                 investigator, the co-principal investigator, a faculty associate                and other members of the research staff.  They will be exposed to               diverse areas of mathematics through a seminar and special                      events.  In particular a mathematician and educator form the                    University of Oregon will give a series of lectures, and                        participants will have the opportunity to attend appropriate                    seminars and lectures on campus.",
