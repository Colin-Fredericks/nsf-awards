 "awd_abstract_narration": "Generalized state-space systems of the form Ex= Ax + Bu, with E                 generally singular, arise naturally in the study of robots, networks,           large-scale interconnected systems, power systems, economic systems,            delay-differential systems, neural networks, and elsewhere.                                                                                                     Our main contentions are that there are some serious limitations in             state-variable theory and that singular systems provide a more general          context that yields important insight into some deep questions about            state-variable systems.  Two important cases will be studied in the             proposed research.                                                                                                                                              First, we point out that the inverse of a state-space system is not a           state-variable system.  Indeed, the inverse generally contains                  derivatives of the output, so that it is a singular system.                     Therefore, singular systems, not state-variable systems, provide the            natural dynamical formulation for the study of issues related to                inversion.  This includes high-grain feedback, singular optimal                 control (in the traditional sense of incomplete control weighting),             and other important problems as well as the usual system inversion              problems.  Our first goal is, therefore, to study the extensions and            properties of the Singular System Structure Algorithm which has been            developed in connection with inversion and optimal control of singular          systems.                                                                                                                                                        Second, if proportional-plus-derivative output feedback is applied to           a state-space system, the result is a singular and not a state-                 variable system.  These systems therefore provide a nature formulation          for carrying out our second goal, the study of proportional-plus                derivative output feedback in state-variable and singular systems.              Recent results make it clear that using this technique, far more can            be achieved than the assignment of the traditional min(n, m+p-1)                poles.",
