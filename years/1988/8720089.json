 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to establish a National                            Instrumentation Facility for NMR of Biological Solids.  New                     solids NMR techniques will be developed and applied to solve                    practical and important problems in the biological sciences.  The               Facility will consist of three existing solids spectrometers,                   with two more to be built over the next two years.  Via                         collaborative research, new solids NMR experiments to be                        developed or refined include:  13C-170 double-cross polarization,               rotational-echo double resonance, and DANTE-labeled 13C-13C spin                diffusion.  These experiments will be combined with existing                    solids NMR techniques to identify cross-links in insect                         exoskeleton and plant cell walls, to establish the mechanism of                 drug action on bacterial cell-wall metabolism, to identify                      binding sites in immobilized enzymes, to measure the dynamics and               conformational flexibility within the active sites of enzymes,                  to measure the mobility of multiple sites in lipid chains in the                gel state without specific labeling of the lipids, and to monitor               nondescructively the catabolism of drugs, herbicides, and                       pesticides in mammalian tissue.                                                                                                                                 The principal investigator has a long history of successful                     biological collaborations, his laboratory has demonstrated an                   ability to develop new NMR technology, he has accumulated solids                NMR spectrometers with capabilities unmatched by any other                      single laboratory, and the principal investigator has experience                in translating results of basic scientific research into useful                 end products.  For these reasons support is recommended.",
