 "awd_abstract_narration": "The relationship between depth and chemistry is one of the              most-studied aspects of mid-ocean ridge basalt genesis, because                 such a relationship provides evidence of the connection between                 physical processes in the mantle and the chemical composition                   of the ocean crust.  The mid-Atlantic ridge between the Kane                    and Hayes fracture zones (24  - 33 N) has a change of 1500                      meters in regional depth, yet is erupting almost exclusively                    \"normal MORB.\"                                                                          Currently at Lamont more than forty on and off-axis                     dredges from this regions exist, including twenty-nine                          collected by the PI in January 1987 in a NSF funded project.                    Preliminary microprobe data show that there are clearly                         defined, systematic variations in major elements that are                       consistent with the global correlations between depth and                       chemistry is shown by the PI and has associates.  This region                   is ideal for exploring the detailed systematic of depth/                        chemistry relationships for normal MORB in terms of major                       elements, trace elements and isotopes.  It is proposed to carry                 out precise analytical studies of major elements trace                          elements, highly incompatible trace elements and isotopes from                  basalt glasses and whole rocks this region to understand the                    complex problem of petrogensis of Mid Ocean Ridge basalts.",
