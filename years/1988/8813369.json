 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nonadiabatic couplings among states of a colliding pair of                 atoms or molecules have an essential role in determining state-                 specific cross-sections for a wide range of elastic and                         inelastic collision processes.  These include nonradiative                      electronic transitions such as quenching or fine-structure                      transitions, coherence transfer and collisional depolarization,                 and rotational and vibrational energy transfer.  Nonadiabatic                   effects are also important in photofragmentation processes such                 as photodissociation, photoionization, or collisional                           redistribution of light.  Experimental studies of effects of                    nonadiabatic couplings on the dynamics of optical collisions                    between alkali (sodium and lithium) and rare gas atoms will be                  carried out.  Both fine-structure branching and the production                  of Zeeman multipoles will be investigated, along with the                       recently observed nonlinear laser intensity dependence of the                   fine-structure branching.  An investigation of the LiHe and                     NaHe molecular Rydberg spectrum, which should exhibit                           significant rotational nonadiabaticity through the core                         rotation and vibration, will also be pursued.",
