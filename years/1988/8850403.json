 "awd_abstract_narration": "Principals for the Advancement of Leadership in Science (PALS) is a             three-year project designed to establish a network of centers throughout        the United States for the enhancement of science leadership among               elementary school principals.  The National Science Teachers                    Association, the National Association of Elementary School Principals,          the National Science Supervisors Association, and other public and              private groups will form an alliance promoting science leadership of            principals.   In l988, twelve PALS Network center directors, assisted by        a cadre of experienced elementary school principal consultants, will            establish centers of science instruction and support for principals.            Beginning in l989 each of the centers will conduct three Regional               Science Leadership Conferences for principal/partner teams, for a total         of thirty-six conferences involving approximately 1,080 school                  administrator leaders.  In addition, the PALS network sites,                    interconnected by computers and linked to the National Science Education        Computer Network, will establish themselves as highly-visible, long-term        centers of support and service for advocating science leadership among          elementary school principals.",
