 "awd_abstract_narration": "Preliminary results of the measurement of distances of galaxy                   clusters in the southern hemisphere suggest peculiar velocities of              500 to 1000 km/sec.  These relative distance measurements are                   based on the infrared Tully-Fisher relation, in which the                       luminosities of galaxies correlate with their 21-centimeter                     neutral hydrogen gas (HI) line widths.  The clusters are mostly                 contained within the Hydra-Centaurus supercluster region of the                 sky.                                                                                                                                                            A program to carry out and extend these measurements will be                    completed.  There are four elements in the plan:  1)  to optimize               and better understand the Tully-Fisher relation as a distance                   indicator, 2) to carry out detailed surface photometry of the                   galaxies, 3) to extend the number of clusters currently under                   study, and 4) to complete an all sky sample of clusters of                      galaxies.                                                                                                                                                       The current preliminary results tend to support those of                        Drs. Burstein, Davies, Dressler, Faber, Lynden-Bell, Terlevich and              Wegner, and suggest that elements of the Hydra Centaurus                        supercluster share the motion of the Local Supercluster.  With the              completion of this program, the frequency of such peculiar                      velocities larger than 250 km/sec on scales from 5-30 h-1 Mpc will              place important constraints on the spectrum of the initial                      density fluctuations from which galaxies and clusters have grown.",
