 "awd_abstract_narration": "Academic Industrial Teachers Internship Program focuses on the premise          that if teachers know and understand they will do a better job of               directing students into the courses required to succeed in an                   engineering program.                                                                                                                                            For each of two summers, twenty-four high school teachers from minority         schools nationwide will come to the University of Wisconsin for a two           week workshop learning about engineering disciplines, engineering               opportunities, and the correlation between engineering concepts and             classroom instruction in mathematics, chemistry, and physics.  A six            week internship will allow the participants to work side by side with           engineers, technicians, and computer specialists.                                                                                                               This project offers the opportunity to specifically address several             items of significance.  Namely, the concern for increasing minority             participation in the fields of engineering.  The collaborative effort           between industry and higher education; the need to better prepare               teachers to counsel students into the proper mathematics, chemistry and         physics courses; and to achieve a balance between the theoretical and           the practical.  This project can serve as a model of a kind of                  enrichment program for enhancing minority participation in science,             mathematics, and engineering.",
