 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research continues an investigation of multi-agent                    planning. The theoretical basis of this work, the Group Element                 Model (GEM), is implemented in a computer system (GEMPLAN). The                 approach taken is to explicitly subdivide the planning problem into             regions of activity.  Research is targeted to discovering how                   planning constraints and properties can be localized within these               regions, and how coordination and synchronization can be maintained             between regions.  The technical approach is through first-order                 temporal logic for constraint descriptions, and algorithms for                  local search and constraint satisfaction are developed.                              The importance of this research is that multi-agent                        planning systems are useful in a wide variety of applications,                  such as factory scheduling and assembly by co-ordinated groups                  of robots.  This work develops both the theoretical basis and                   engineering experience required to expand multi-agent planning                  technology.",
