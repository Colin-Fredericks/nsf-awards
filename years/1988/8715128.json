 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dentrification, the microbially mediated production of (N2O)               and (N2), from desert systems in the Southwest will be studied.                 Measurements of denitrification potentials will be made on soil                 cores from three desert ecosystems. Data from this research will                improve our understanding of the nitrogen cycle in desert                       ecosystems and it will also help us to interpret the importance                 of desert ecosystems as sources of N2O, a major greenhouse gas.                      Measurements of denitrification potentials will be made on                 soil cores from three desert ecosystems - the Great Basin, Mojave               and Chihuahuan deserts.  In addition laboratory studies will be                 conducted to determine what factors control denitrification in                  deserts and what biochemical pathways are responsible for N2O                   production in these soils.  A state-of-the-art gas                              chromatographic technique (G3Ni electron capture) will be used                  for the N2O analyses.                                                                The reserach will be coordinated from Duke University,                     although much of the field work will be done at the Long-Term                   Ecological Research site in southern New Mexico - New Mexico                    State's Jornada site in the Chihuahuan Desert.  The  facilities                 available in support of the research at Duke and at the New                     Mexico State are very good, and the personnel to be involved in                 the work are of high quality.  The Ecosystem Studies Program                    recommends support of this grant request.",
