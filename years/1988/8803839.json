 "awd_abstract_narration": "Minerals of the apatite group are very important accessory                      minerals in all types of rocks.  As a major constituent of bones                and teeth it is the object of much research in the medical field,               and is commercially exploited for a number of important uses.  The              relative chemical and structural simplicity of apatite and its                  occurrence in a very wide range of rock types make it potentially               ideal as s mineralogical \"monitor\" of the relative activities of                fluorine, chlorine and water in the environment in which it                     crystallized.  It is proposed to calibrate this \"monitor\" by                    determining the solid solution mixing behavior and by evaluation                of endmember thermodynamic properties with experiments at 0.5 Kb                pressure, and temperatures between 600o and 900oC.  The                         information to be derived from this study will have important                   applications in the study of igneous processes and volcanic                     phenomena, formation of porphyry ore deposits, and composition of               metamorphic fluids.  The fundamental thermodynamic data obtained                may potentially have applications in other sciences and chemical                engineering.",
