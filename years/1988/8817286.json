 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds will provide travel grants to three American members of                the Mid-Carboniferous Boundary Working Group of the Subcommission               on Carboniferous Stratigraphy (SCCS) of the International Union of              Geological Sciences (IUGS).  These grants will allow participation              in a geological field conference organized for the working group                by the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, and the USSR National                     Geological Committee.  The meeting will be held September 20-29,                1988, in Kiev and the Donets Basin (Donbass), eastern Ukrainia.                 The rock column in this part of the Donets Basin is a strong                    candidate to become the mid-Carboniferous boundary stratotype                   because it contains the appropriate boundary-defining fossils in a              seemingly continuous depositional sequence.  Members of the                     working group need first-hand observation to evaluate fully all                 stratotype candidates.  American members also provide expertise on              the important fossil groups involved in statotype evaluation, as                well as significant leadership in working group activities.                     Participation by Americans in this working group meeting will                   facilitate acceptance and understanding of the bipartite division               of the Carboniferous passed at Beijing, 1987, at a level                        compatible with its historical usage in North America.",
