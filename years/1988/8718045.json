In the leech,                        individual neurons arise from precise cell lineages and express                 unique combinations of differentiated characteristics.  These                   neuronal cell lineages have only been partially described, and                  one of the objectives of the research will be to characterize the               complete sequence of cell divisions which lead to the formation                 of a small number of identified neurons.  The investigators will                then perform embryonic cell ablations in order to ascertain                     whether the number and identity of the neurons produced by a                    given lineage are determined by cell interactions or by factors                 that are intrinsic to precursor cells.  The cellular basis of                   those interactions and/or intrinsic factors will be studied in                  further detail.  In addition, the P.I.'s will investigate the way               in which different cell lineages communicate in order to bring                  about coordinated patterns of neurogenesis.  In particular, they                will examine the spatial coordination of homologous cell lineages               located in different portions of the nervous system.  Results                   obtained from this work will advance our understanding of the way               in which cellular diversity and specificity arise during neural                 development.",
