 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this research project is to obtain a detailed                  understanding at the molecular level the kinetics and mechanisms                of gas - surface interactions.  Changes in the nature of the                    adsorbate chemical bond are studied by time resolved electron                   energy loss spectroscopy (TREELS) coupled with fast temperature                 and pressure perturbations.  A wide range of surface processes                  can be studied by this excite - and - probe technique, including                adsorption/desorption, dissociation, and reaction of adsorbate.                 More specifically, the proposed project will address problems in                the following areas:  1.  alkali-promoted dissociations and                     reactions, 2.  effects of impurities on surface kinetics, 3.                    synthesis reactions, and 4.  electron and photon induced                        reactions.  Extension of the experimental time resolution from                  millisecond to microsecond range will be undertaken.  In addition               to improvise a faster 96-channel multidector and data acquisition               electronics for TREELS, the more rapid pressure and temperature                 perturbations will be achieved by the addition of a chopper to                  the pulsed molecular beam and direct heating with a microsecond                 pulsed laser, respectively.  A pulsed electron source will be                   generated from a negative electron affinity GaAs photocathode.",
