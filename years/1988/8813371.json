 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most economic theories specify equilibrium relationships                   among economic variables, and, at least implicitly, the                         equilibrium information flows among economic decision-makers.                   However, the adjustment process which moves the system to an                    equilibrium position is usually not specified. This research                    proposes a method for analyzing a general class of such adjustment              processes.  The principal goal of this analysis is to determine                 the minimal communication and coordination among economic                       decision-makers needed to achieve equilibrium.  This can be                     compared with the information flow generated by the economic                    institutions under study.  If the latter is less than the former,               equilibrium cannot generally be achieved, and the equilibrium                   relationships cannot reliably approximate actual economic                       behavior.  This information analysis is proposed as a new source                of discipline in the evaluation of economic models.                                  When the convergence to equilibrium requires information                   which cannot easily be communicated in an ongoing fashion, two                  directions of research are suggested.  First, the additional                    information might be inferred from the historical behavior of                   observable variables, and this information might then be used in                the design of the adjustment process.  Second, the equilibrium                  concept might be changed to embody more modest optimality                       criteria.  The latter approach is proposed specifically for the                 theory of the firm when communication is limited to accounting                  information.",
