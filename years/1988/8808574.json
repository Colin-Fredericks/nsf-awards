 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on the problem of succinctly storing shortest, or         near-shortest, path routing information in a distributed network which          experiences changes in topology and edge costs. The emphasis is on both         identifying such routing schemes and efficient algorithms for                   constructing them.                                                                                                                                              Three interrelated problems are investigated:                                   1.  Design of compact routing schemes that incrementally adapt to               changes by computing a small amount of additional information, which is         then used to restore good routings.                                                                                                                             2.  Design of compact schemes that route messages along two or more             node-disjoint paths of low total cost, thus making the routings                 resilient to faults.                                                                                                                                            3.  Investigation of an interval property of graphs that allows very            succinct encoding of shortest paths.  This finds application in the             updating of routing information when edge costs change.                                                                                                         The techniques used will be based, in part, on naming nodes                     appropriately and on interesting properties of distances in graphs.             Thus, in addition to yielding space-efficient routing schemes, this             research will also provide new insights into the succinct encoding of           information within  node names and on the structure of shortest paths.",
