 "awd_abstract_narration": "This equipment grant is for the purchase of a high volume, high                 temperature, medium pressure (200 atm) unit in which the PI will                produce advanced ceramic materials.  Simultaneously, General Electric           is donating several small volume, high temperature, high pressure               (80,000 atm) units to this research group thus establishing a viable            core of equipment for the study of optimal reaction conditions needed           for the manufacture of these materials.  SUNY-Buffalo is providing              additional space to the PI to enhance the overall effort and make this          a world-class experimental facility.  Advanced ceramics are                     differentiated from traditional ceramics by the specialized properties          they posses as well as by the sophisticated processing they require.            Some examples of advanced ceramic materials are silicon nitride                 (Si3N4), silicon carbide (SiC) and aluminum nitride (AlN) and they              might have many uses for example as heat - and wear-resistant parts to          electronic and optical devices.  The PI has developed a new concept             for high-temperature, high-pressure, self-propagating simultaneous              synthesis and sintering in a single reactor in a very short period of           time utilizing the liberation of heat by the strongly exothermic                reactions involved.  He is also looking at a new concept for bonding            between different ceramic materials or ceramics and metals,                     specifically bonding silicon nitride, aluminum oxide and ceramic                materials to molybdenum and stainless steel.  This specific apparatus           will be used for samples of larger dimensions (e.g. 6\" x 6\" x 2\") such          as welding of TiB2 and SiC tubes, welding to Mo sheets, combustion of           Si powder in N2, etc.",
