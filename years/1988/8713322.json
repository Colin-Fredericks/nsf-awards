 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research between Prof.                          Wm. M. Jenkins of UCal-SF Medical School and  Prof.                             Eliana Guic, University of Chile, Santiago on                                   cortical representational dynamics in behaving adult                            animals.  They will attempt to demonstrate the changes                          in functional organization of the cerebral cortex of                            rats following surgical manipulations to the                                    vibrissae-cortical system.  A reorganization of the                             cortex barrel field after cauterization of the                                  vibrissae follicles, lesioning and clipping of certain                          vibrissae (whiskers), will demonstrate brain                                    plasticity subsequent to behavioral training.                                                                                                                   The study will benefit from the considerable animal                             training experience of Dr. Guic and colleagues while                            the responsibility for the design and construction of                           the behavioral testing apparatus with a computer                                program base will rest with Dr. Jenkins.  Therefore                             the visits to Chile are essential and this work will                            facilitate traing young colleagues in a developing                              country.  In addition, it will add to the                                       understanding of restorative medicine through                                   knowledge of brain plasticity.  It will establish                               research methods in Dr. Guic's laboratory which will                            permit further research.  The investment is small but                           will promote research in this field and in Chile where                          resources are limited.",
