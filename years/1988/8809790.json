 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will assess the potential of developing ceramic               matrix composites with various two dimensional (2-D) and three                  dimensional (3-D) reinforcements for high temperature structural                applications.  Silicon carbide fiber reinforced silicon carbide                 matrix composite will be used as a model system.  Composites with               different reinforcement geometries including 2-D woven, knitted; 3-D            braided and 3-D angle lock structures will be fabricated.  The                  experimental part will include characterization of the interface                microstructure, damage development, failure modes, and toughening               mechanisms under static fracture, impact and creep loadings.  The               analytical program will establish the constitutive relations, and               the theoretical model of the response of the composite to various               mechanical loading.  In addition, the performance and deformation               mechanism maps of various ceramic composites with the combination of            different fiber/matrix/reinforcement geometry will be constructed.              The results of this work will serve as the knowledge-base for                   processing and design of tough ceremic matrix composites  based upon            2-D and 3-D reinforcements.",
