 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Florida will conduct a four-day workshop during which         fifty State Science Supervisors, or their designees, will use a new             technology known as CD-ROM to increase the amount and appropriateness of        hands-on activities in K-8 science.  One thousand lessons which provide         students experiences and were produced by NSF-funded projects (ESS,             SCIS, SAPA, MINNEMAST, COPES, USMES, and ESSP) have been collected,             analyzed, abstracted and stored on a compact disk during a 1984-1987            Carnegie project.  A powerful search system allows rapid and selective          use of lessons through criteria such as grade level, science processes,         subject, vocabulary words and content themes.  Lessons are in the public        domain and can be printed.                                                                                                                                      Workshop materials will be based on results of a pilot program in ten           Florida school districts and workshop personnel are from the program and        the original CD-ROM project.                                                                                                                                    Though no dollar figure is attributed to the cost-share, the University,        through their School of Architecture, is providing sufficient computers         so that there will be one available for each two participants.",
