 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a joint effort research in the                          evaluation of parallel processing systems, to be carried out by                 researchers based at the University of Massachusetts and the                    French National Institute for Information Science and                           Automation (INRIA).  The U.S. group will be led by Dr. Donald                   Towsley; on the French side the project will be led by                          Dr. Francois Bacelli, INRIA, Rocquencourt.  The research                        project will focus on the following two problems:                                                                                                               1)  The development of a mathematical methodology for                           evaluating the performance of complex parallel systems.  There                  currently exist powerful tools for evaluating the performance                   of sequential programs that execute on single or                                multiprocessors.  The main difference between a sequential and                  a parallel program is the need for synchronization of the                       different activities present in a parallel program execution.                   Consequently, the first goal of the proposed research is to                     develop a methodology for evaluating parallel software                          applications that exhibit this phenomenon.                                                                                                                      2)  The design and analysis of schedulers for multiprogrammed                   multiprocessors that execute parallel programs.  Many existing                  multiprocessors have implemented scheduling policies originally                 developed for single processors.  Initial studies indicate that                 this can result in poor scheduling polices, i.e., policies that                 yield poor performance.  The second goal of the proposed                        research is to develop a methodology for designing scheduling                   policies that yield good performance, such as low response                      times.                                                                                                                                                          This research joins two groups of outstanding U.S. and French                   computer scientists.  INRIA is widely recognized for its                        concentration of expertise in computer research, automation,                    mathematics and scientific computing.  It provides an excellent                 combination of fundamental research with industrial                             collaboration in these areas.",
