 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Anthony E. Siegman,                  Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, to pursue            with Dr. Sang Soo Lee and Dr. Hong Jin Kong, Department of Physics,             Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), for a               period of 24 months, a program of cooperative research to develop a             novel picosecond-time-resolved photothermal detection method for making         ultrafast lifetime measurements of charge carriers and other excited            states on the surfaces of semiconductors and other materials.  The              proposed technique will combine the time resolution of picosecond or            femtosecond optical pulses with the unusual advantages of photothermal          detection as a sensitive, flexible, noncontacting technique applicable          to a large variety of metals, semiconductors and insulators,                    crystalline or amorphous, with essentially no requirements on surface           preparation.  The experimental research will be carried out by Dr.              Kong, with guidance from Drs. Siegman and Lee, using the experimental           facilities available at Dr. Siegman's laboratory at Stanford                    University.                                                                                                                                                     In this research a photothermal detection apparatus will be assembled           and used to make measurements on various physical systems.  The                 photothermal detection technique, in contrast to nearly all other               picosecond measurement techniques, is a completely noncontacting method         which does not require any special surface characteristics, polishing,          or other special preparation.  The collaborators are highly respected           scientists with outstanding credentials in the field of the research.           This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea                    Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the level of                cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through            the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques           and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.",
