 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action is a follow on to NSF CES-8708747, which concerns an                investigation of the stiffness loss in sands following a dynamic                disturbance.  On July 24, 1987, such a disturbance occurred during              seismic oil prospecting, initiating a road embankment slide and                 subsequent roadway collapse on Highway 94 in Michigan's Upper                   Peninsula, twelve miles west of the city of Munising.  This incident            has the potential to generate valuable data relevant to the original            award.                                                                                                                                                          The incident occurred during standard seismic reflection profiling.             Six 22 ton trucks were generating seismic signals for a reflection              study by vibrating the road surface.  It is believed that the flow              slide was initiated by a liquefaction type failure.  Shortly after the          incident, Prof. Hryciw performed the necessary field reconnaissance             and obtained the relevant information and data. This data are now               being analyzed.                                                                                                                                                 It is expected that valuable information relevant to the reduction in           stiffness of cohesionless soils due to earthquake loading can be                extracted from the data obtained as a result of this seismic profiling          incident.",
