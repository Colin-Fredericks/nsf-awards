 "awd_abstract_narration": "Deep winter convection far from land boundaries is an                   important process for transferring momentum and heat between                    the ocean and the atmosphere on seasonal and interannual time                   scales.  The Gulf of Lions in the northwestern Mediterranean is                 one of the very few areas in the world's oceans where direct                    observations of this process can be made.  In this region, deep                 convection occurs over a brief time of the order of about six                   weeks, when it is forced by outbreaks of cold, dry north winds                  known locally as the \"Mistral\".  During the winter of 1987, the                 P.I. and collaborators carried out measurements of convection                   in the Gulf of Lions during one of the most intense Mistrals on                 record.  Included were moored current meters and acoustic                       current profilers, and a variety of shipboard measurements on                   several cruise legs in the area.  This project will support                     processing, analysis, and initial publication of the results of                 this study.",
