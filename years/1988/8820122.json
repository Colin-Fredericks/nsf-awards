Some of the issues that will be addressed are:                          o The extent to which regional cooperation is possible among                    universities and colleges and how that would improve the quality                of research, and what process to use.                                           o Means of improving the diffusion of technologies to small and                 medium-sized businesses;                                                        o Ways to encourage greater participation of women and minorities               in scientific and technolical programs and careers.                             o Means for improving education for scientific and technical                    careers and work.                                                               o Mechanisms to assess the impacts of technology on the                         environment, the economy, and the people.                                               The result will be a detailed plan and a statement of                   regional objectives for Science and Technology that will be                     presented to the Southern Growth Policies Board for review and                  implementation.",
