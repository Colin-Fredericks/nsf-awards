 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Graphics is a new discipline that has profoundly changed          traditional approaches to Engineering Design.  This project will present        Computer Graphics as a new discipline in engineering curricula and as a         significant new tool for Engineering Design and Drafting.                                                                                                            The format of the project is a Seminar/Workshop with a group of 16         carefully selected participants during a three week period.  It will            include presentations, discussions, demonstrations and other forms of           interaction between participants and faculty that are active in teaching        and research in the area of Engineering and Computer Graphics.                                                                                                       The project will attract, interest, and enlighten experienced and          promising undergraduate instructors teaching Engineering Graphics who           need motivation, background, and know-how to develop new Computer               Graphics laboratories and to apply leading-edge technology to the               teaching of modern, computer aided design and drafting (CADD)-based             Engineering Graphics courses.  It also promises to prepare participants         for and to help them in their efforts to introduce new courses in               Engineering Computer Graphics, and to motivate them to become self-             reliant in making and publishing their own contributions to this field          of Engineering Education.                                                                                                                                           In addition to NSF support, participants will provide about 10% in          travel costs, and the University is contributing an additional 15%.",
