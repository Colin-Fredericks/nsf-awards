 "awd_abstract_narration": "In September, 1986 the New York Zoological Society, funded by NSF,              initiated a program for 30 outstanding middle and secondary school              science teachers from New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.  The               program was entitled \"Zoos for Effective Science\" (Z.E.S.T.).  The              present proposal is a continuation of the program for two additional            years.                                                                                                                                                          Six hour sessions, held on 8 Saturdays, January through March 1987,             involve behind-the-scenes touring, animal observation and data-gathering        activities, audio/visual programs and presentations by zoo staff on             animal behavior, cooperative breeding and demographic management for zoo        animals, and care of classroom animals.  Segments are conducted on how          to design innovative materials linking classroom curriculum with use of         the Zoo and on assisting participants with peer-training techniques.            Role-playing exercises are used to enhance the confidence of the                teachers in peer training.                                                                                                                                      Participants receive a wide range of printed materials including WIZE           (Wildlife Inquiry through Zoo Education) classroom kits:  Diversity             of Lifestyles and Survival Strategies.  WIZE, the winner of several             prestigious awards for excellence in science education, is a life               science curriculum  for grades 6 through 12 developed by the Bronx Zoo          with major funding from the National Science Foundation.                                                                                                        Each participant will select a subject of special relevance to his or           her science discipline and develops an instructional unit on the topic.         The best of the instructional units will be reviewed for inclusion in a         Z.E.S.T. Teachers Manual, which will be made available to science               teachers in the tri-state area for use in conjunction with class visits         to the Bronx Zoo.                                                                                                                                               The topics teachers chose to concentrate on and the materials they              received in their Z.E.S.T. training also serve as the basis for peer            training the teachers are expected to conduct in their own schools.             Prior to the Z.E.S.T. program, administrators from the participants'            schools attend a conference at the Zoo for an overview of the project.          The importance of their support to the teachers, particularly in their          efforts to train their peers, is also stressed.                                                                                                                 This project has a number of features which justify its funding as a            Teacher Enhancement Project.  The following are the more significant:           1) it broadens the perceptions about zoos being educational; 2) it              presents techniques and materials using animal exhibitions in                   conjunction with classroom instruction; and 3) develops a model for use         by zoos throughout the country.",
