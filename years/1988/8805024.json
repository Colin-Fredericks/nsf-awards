The projects                      planned include instrumentation for surface adsorption studies, a               charged particle energy analyzer, and astronomical measurements,                in addition to radiometer analysis, acoustics experiments and                   other surface science experiments.  Students will be working                    half-time on the project during the summer and part-time during                 two long academic year sessions to allow them to continue to work               outside the University to contribute to family income.                               This project is supported under the \\program of Research                   Experiences for Undergraduates to help ensure an adequate supply                of scientists for the future.",
