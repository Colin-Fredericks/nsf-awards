 "awd_abstract_narration": "An optically-pumped, near-mm-wave, high-intensity laser has been                constructed at Cornell University for the purpose of measuring                  the nonlinear susceptibility of two dimensional electron gas (2-                DEG) structures in the Terahertz frequency region.  A                           collaborative Industry/University research program is proposed,                 entered around this instrumentation, in which measurements are                  made on the far infrared nonlinear properties of high mobility 2-               DEG samples provided by IBM.  One goal is to drive the collective               2-DEG electronic modes far from equilibrium with high intensity                 resonant radiation tuned to the natural quantum transition                      frequencies.  Since very little research has been carried out as                yet on the nonlinear high frequency properties of 2-DEG systems a               number of different experiments are proposed.  These include                    saturation measurements on the sub-band states and on the                       cyclotron resonance mode in magnetic fields up to 11 Tesla,                     identification of resonant and nonresonant hot electron effects,                observation of period doubling and a new type of second harmonic                generation predicted to occur for the 2-DEG surface layer and                   appears in the sample at high intensities.  A continuation of the               investigation of persistent IR hole burning at defects in                       semiconductors is also proposed with effort directed toward                     probing the dynamic of the DX center in aluminum-gallium-arsenide               and the divacancy in silicon.",
