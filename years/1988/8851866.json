 "awd_abstract_narration": "A computer-controlled, modern, high performance liquid chromatograph            (HPLC) is providing the capability for students to study state-of-the-          art methods for separation and analysis of complex liquid solutions.            Computer control is being achieved by purchasing appropriate hardware           and software in lieu of the dedicated terminal normally supplied with           the chromatograph.  With this modification, the new chromatograph is            being integrated into the existing computer network at the university,          which will vastly increase the effectiveness of the instrument.  Data           acquisition, processing and storage and instrument control is becoming          more flexible, and interaction with other instruments on the network            (e.g., visible/ultraviolet spectrometer and gas chromatograph) is               becoming feasible.  The modernization of the HPLC capability is                 necessary for the department to maintain adequate faciltities for the           education of the small group of chemistry majors and the considerably           larger group of health science majors.  The instrument is being used            throughout the chemistry curriculum as well as throughout the Natural           Science Division for undergraduate student research.                                                                                                            The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.",
