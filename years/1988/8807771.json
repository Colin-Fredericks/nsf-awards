 "awd_abstract_narration": "\u001aThe mechanisms by which topography influences soil acidity and H.+             budgets along an elevation gradient in the Alaskan tundra will be               studied.  A central hypothesis of the proposal is that H.+                      production and consumption in a tundra elevation gradient are                   regulated primarily by belowground chemical and microbial                       processes that depend on topographically induced variation in                   redox potentials.                                                                                                                                               To examine the topographic variation in soil acidity and test the               central hypothesis, six ecosystems along an elevation gradient of               about 300m on the banks of the Sagavanirktok River, north of the                Brooks Range, will be examined.  Part of the study will be                      descriptive.  Patterns of acidity will be determined by measuring               free H.+, and titratable acidity, exchangeable cations, and the                 acid strength of the exchange complex.  In addition, estimations                will be made of the major components of H.+ budgets, including                  atmospheric inputs, internal ecosystem production and                           consumption, and export.  The study will also include                           experimental manipulations to test the controls of H.+ production               in three of the six ecosystems along the elevation gradient.                                                                                                    A combination of standard methods will be used to measure the                   various components of the H.+ budget.  Among these are: 1)                      denitrification by anaerobic laboratory assays using the                        acetylene block procedure; 2) nitrification by the buried bag                   procedure; and 3) plant ion balance by the biomass accumulation                 procedure.                                                                                                                                                      A H.+ budget serves to validate our understanding of                            biogeochemical cycling in an ecosystem.  Better understanding of                biogeochemical cycling in the tundra is needed for its wise                     management.                                                                                                                                                     Dr. Binkley is a productive researcher who has substantial                      experience in developing H.+ ion budgets.  The institutional                    support available to him is very good.",
