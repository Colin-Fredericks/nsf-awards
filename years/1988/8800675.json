 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of separation science.  The                       objective of this research is the continuing development of the                 science and technology of field-flow fractionation (FFF) and                    related methods; this work will be carried out in four subareas.                (1) Thermal FFF Characterization of Polymeric Materials.  In this               area, the underlying thermal diffusion processes that are                       essential to thermal FFF will be characterized.  A coupled column-              channel system will be developed using a combination of thermal                 FFF and size exclusion chromatography to characterize the                       composition and molecular weight distribution of copolymer blends.              Thermal FFF will be optimized for high-speed polymer analysis and               the applicability of this technique to ultra-high molecular weight              polymers will be explored.  (2) High Speed Flow/Steric                          (Hyperlayer) FFF.  Work on this recently developed technique will               be performed with the objective of optimizing, calibrating,                     extending the range, improving the repeatability, exploring                     practical applications, and understanding the basic forces that                 govern the performance of these new systems.  (3) Split-Flow Thin               (SPLITT) Continuous Separation Cells.  In this thrust, SPLITT                   separations based on diffusive, sedimentation, and electrical                   transport processes will be explored with special emphasis on                   scale-up to a practical preparative level.  (4) New FFF Theory and              Methodology.  Here, Professor Giddings will continue his pursuit                of new FFF techniques along both theoretical and experimental                   lines.  Continued attention will be paid to refining the                        theoretical basis for FFF separations.                                                                                                                          This research continues the Principal Investigator's development                of analytical and preparative separations of complex, high                      molecular weight materials by several FFF variants.  Each of these              FFF methods offers unique advantages which, when appropriately                  matched to the problem at hand, can give rise to enhanced                       analytical capability.  Whereas the complexity of implementation                of these techniques has thus far impeded their broad adoption, the              sheer power of the methods places them significantly above                      competitive approaches for the characterization of polymeric                    substances of key importance to materials and biotechnological                  processes.  The continued development of FFF techniques will                    provide a formidable arsenal of analytical and preparative tools                for use in these technologically important areas.  Additionally,                Professor Giddings' continued demonstration of the broad                        applicability of these tools should expedite their adoption by the              materials and bioscience communities.",
