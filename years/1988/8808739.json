 "awd_abstract_narration": "Textile and garment manufacturing have historically been one of                 the most important industries in the United States.  Even today,                major trade disputes center upon efforts to protect our domestic                textile and garment manufacturers from foreign competition.                     Within women's history, garment manufacturing has been especially               important since, next to domestic service, it was the principal                 employer of women in the 19th century.  Yet we know very little                 about garment workers or the development and diffusion of new                   garment making technologies--especially in comparison to textile                workers and the textile technology.  How did new technologies                   change this industry?  How did it make possible the move from a                 cottage industry to a factory industry?  How did the new                        technologies affect the introduction of new product lines?                                                                                                      In order to begin to examine these and other questions concerning               this important industry, Dr. Farrell-Beck has three aims under                  this research grant:  to document the use of selected sewing                    machines and attachments in manufactured U. S. clothing in the                  second half of the 19th century; to determine the time lag                      between patenting of machines and attachments and their                         application to factory production of clothing; and to learn how                 construction of factory made clothing changed between 1850 and                  1899.  The project is designed to bridge the gap between research               on sewing machines and studies of 19th century clothing                         construction by analyzing garments as machine products.  This                   research will extend knowledge of 19th century industries,                      complement the literature on the manufacture of yarn and fabric                 in the United States, and reveal differences in manufacturing                   technology between clothing and other goods.  In order to carry                 out this research, Dr. Farrell-Beck will examine selected U. S.                 patents for sewing machines and attachments, then examine all                   aspects of the construction of 150 factory made garments for men,               women and children in the period before 1900.  She will carry out               this research in three large museum collections in Minnesota,                   Michigan, and New York.  She will analyze results in order to                   determine what trends are apparent in the diffusion of                          technologies and techniques in this important industry.",
