 "awd_abstract_narration": "Merit, Inc. will serve as the organization responsible for           NSFNET.  It will execute the required agreement with NSF/DNCRI                  and other involved parties, will manage the financial aspects of                NSFNET operation, and will provide the central management,                      operation, and policy coordination for NSFNET.  In addition,                    Merit will acquire the equipment and circuits required to                       construct the network, will operate the network, and will                       coordinate the process so as to meet the NSF requirements for                   network engineering, protocols, and standards.  Merit will                      arrange for policy and planning support for NSF/DNCRI and provide               a full set of NSFNET Information Services.  Merit has arranged                  for major involvement by IBM and MCI to assist in acquiring the                 necessary technology and transmission facilities needed for                     NSFNET.  Merit's role as an integrator of the technology provided               by its two industrial partners in this effort makes possible an                 extraordinarily powerful network architecture based on synergy                  between packet and circuit switching under the control of                       sophisticated network management tools.",
