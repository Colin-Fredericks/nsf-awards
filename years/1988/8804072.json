 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research is aimed at using high resolution and                         microsampling techniques for isotopic studies of two types of ore               deposits with which the PIs have extensive experience - MVT-type                deposits of the North Pennine orefield and the Cornubian base                   metal province.  Emphasis will be placed on developing the                      analytical technology to use isotopic methods as a means of under-              standing the scale, timing, and causes of hydrothermal fluid                    circulation in the continental lithosphere and the role of fluids               in effecting mass transfer and intracrustal differentiation.                    Integration of (a) multi-isotopic (Nd, Sr, Pb, O, H, N, Ar, S, C)               studies of individual minerals, (b) Sm-Nd dating of key minerals,               (c) Ar-Ar dating of small, fine grained minerals, and (d) Ar-Ar                 and Rb-Sr dating of fluid inclusions.  The goal is to determine                 source reservoirs of hydrothermal fluids and their interactions                 with crustal rocks and their role in mineralization.  The strength              of the proposal lies in the integration of so many different                    isotopic systems, which to date has been limited by lack of                     technological developments.  The Michigan lab is well equipped for              most of the proposed work.",
