 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to determine how the antigen                  receptor repertoire of the population of antigen-specific                       cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) derived from a previously                        immunized animal differs from that recognizing the same antigen                 but obtained from an immunologically naive donor.   The CTL                     response to fluorescein-coupled cells will be used as a model                   system.  A variety of structural homologues of fluorescein can be               coupled to the surfaces of stimulator and target cells and used                 to define the fine specificity of the responding CTLs.  An                      extensive number of short term monoclonal fluorescein-specific                  CTL populations will then be determined by analysis of the                      reactivity patterns of each of the clones on the panel of                       fluorescein homologues as well as variants of the stimulating                   major histocompatibility molecule.  Simultaneously, methodologies               for the derivation of long term clones of primary and secondary                 CTLs will be refined in order to ascertain the use of particular                receptor gene combinations in early and late CTL populations.                   One of the proposed techniques for the generation of long term                  CTL clones which will be tested involves a novel, and potentially               extremely useful application of hybridoma technology, in which                  DNA derived from a tumor cell is transfected directly into an                   activated CTL.                                                                       The overall goal of this research is to further                            understanding of the nature of immunological memory.  In                        particular, it asks the question:  \"How does the population of                  antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes derived from a                         previously immunized animal differ from that recognizing the same               antigen but obtained from an immunologically naive animal?\"                     Previous results from this laboratory have shown that cytotoxic                 lymphocytes from previously immunized animals are capable of                    recognizing cell surface attached antigen at a lower density than               are lymphocytes from non-immune animals.  The current research is               directed toward determining the factor(s) controlling this                      difference. The results of this research should increase our                    fundamental understanding of the mechanism of immunological                     memory.",
