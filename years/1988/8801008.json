The goal of this project is to determine the factors controlling                a population of dragonfly larvae inhabiting rocky shorelines of                 Lake Superior.  The approach employs a variety of techniques to                 test hypotheses seeking to explain the distribution and abundance               of the dragonflies.  The small size and clear water of the pools                facilitate censusing population sizes and observing behavioral                  interactions with minimal disturbance to the community.  In                     addition, the rocky shoreline contains a large number of similar                pools,  so it is possible to perform well-replicated field                      experiments without erecting cages or pens.  Several experiments                address the hypotheses that populations are limited by                          competition for food or cannibalism between size classes.  The                  temperatures of many pools will be continuously measured to                     determine if dragonflies are excluded from some pools by extreme                conditions in summer or winter.  Adult dragonflies will be                      monitored to determine if patterns of larval distribution are                   produced by oviposition preferences.  The results of this project               will help generate a clearer picture of what controls natural                   insect populations; such information is necessary for designing                 appropriate programs for pest management and biological control.",
