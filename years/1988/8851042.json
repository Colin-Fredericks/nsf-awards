 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recognizing the problems of attracting women into science related               careers and the critical nature of the middle school years in career            decisions, this project will develop and test several unique strategies         for creating and sustaining an interest in science among young women.           First, all the science activities will be built from personal interest          of female students of the age to counter the often heard complaint by           girls that science is boring.  Second, the science activities will take         place in a variety of settings -- traditional school environments, on           weekends, at home, in after-school clubs, and at the Boston Museum of           Science -- to demonstrate that science knowledge and activities relate          to all aspects of life.  Third, the activities will be led by women who         are models for the young girls -- women scientists, women relatives,            women teachers, and girls from older peer groups  -- to counter the male        dominant atmosphere of most formal scientific environments.  Finally,           the whole project will be planned and implemented by a team of people           representing school and college faculty, business and industry, and the         Museum of Science. The hypothesis that the diversity in the people and          programs involved in this project will significantly improve the                probability of creating an interest in science in young women will be           tested.                                                                                                                                                         Cost sharing by the partners will total 25% of the NSF funding.",
