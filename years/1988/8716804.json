 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hybrid zones between genetically different populations or               species provide an unusual opportunity to study the speciation                  process. A number of phenomena in hybrid zones can influence how                speciation takes place.  The availability of new molecular                      markers of the DNA in varied organisms provides an unusual                      opportunity to study hybrid zones.  Mitochondria are housed in                  the cell cytoplasm and carry out respiration in all eukaryotic                  cells; these structures have their own DNA distinct from                        chromosomal DNA.  In studies of hybrid zones the availability of                maternally transmitted genetic markers, as provided in mtDNA, is                particularly important.  The maternal inheritance of mtDNA makes                it analogous to the pattern of inheritance of surnames in many                  human societies, and just as surnames allow the tracing of human                genealogies, so does mtDNA allow the tracing of matriarchical                   pedigrees in virtually any higher organism.                                             The aims of this proposal are to: (1) develop novel measures            of mitochondrial-nuclear associations; (2) determine the dynamics               of these associations; (3) introduce novel statistical procedures               for estimating these measures of association; (4) apply this new                methodology to several real and hypothetical data sets on hybrid                zones.                                                                                  Several hybrid zones are of considerable practical                      importance.  The recently introduced species of fire ants,                      Solenopsis invicta and S. richteri, are a major agricultural pest               in the Southeast.  Similar concerns arise in  the biological                    control of other agriculturally or medically important species                  complexes, such as the screw worm or the \"yellow-fever\" mosquito,               Aedes aegypti.",
