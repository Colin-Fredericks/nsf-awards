 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to study samples of hydrothermal                     precipitates that have been obtained from two sites on the Mid-                 Atlantic Ridge. The samples have ben obtained by dredging,                      drilling and by submersible operations; and the samples include                 sulfides, oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, chlorides, and                        sulfates.  The composition and mineralogy of selected samples                   will be obtained by X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence,                      microscopy, and photography.  Collaborating investigators will                  perform isotopic and other analyses.  The analyses of these                     samples is important because they come from a site that is                      approximately 1 kilometer deeper than similar samples from the                  East Pacific Rise.  It is important to understand how different                 pressure and temperature conditions affect the composition and                  mineralogy of seafloor hydrothermal precipitates.",
