 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides the first of an expected two years of                       support.  It allows Dr. Ward and his collaborators to study                     skulls of fossil primates which date to the Miocene period:  from               approximately 25 million to 4 million years ago.  To establish a                comparative context research will also be conducted on                          collections of living apes.  Specimens from localities in East                  Africa, Europe, Southern and East Asia will be comparatively                    evaluated for the presence or absence of a number of features.                  These observations will be augmented by quantitative stereometry                which permits the analysis of complex anatomical surfaces.  On                  the basis of this and previous studies it should be possible to                 assign the major Miocene samples to their appropriate groups and                determine the relationship between these and possible living                    descendents.                                                                                                                                                    Through analysis of fossil remains, human ancestry can be traced                back about 4 million years.  The orangutan, another of the                      hominoids can be traced back into the Miocene.  The ancestry of                 the African great apes - the gorilla and chimpanzee - is unknown.               In the last several years a large number of Miocene hominoid                    fossils have been recovered and these indicate that these large                 bodied primates were present in many parts of the Old World.  It                is also clear that they belong to a number of species.  However                 scientists still cannot agree how many species are present or how               they relate (if at all) to modern species.  Dr. Ward's analysis                 should help to answer this question.                                                                                                                            This research is important because increases our understanding of               the development of both our own and closely related species and                 will give us insight into the processes which have shaped this                  development over time.  Fossils, often recovered at great                       expense, only achieve their full worth when analyzed and                        understood.  Dr. Ward's research will make a significant                        contribution towards this end.",
