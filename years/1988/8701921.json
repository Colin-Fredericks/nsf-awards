 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the advent of modern computers it is possible to tackle the                numerical simulation of condensed matter physics problems using                 realistic models.  Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a computational                   technique which allows the study of the statistical mechanics of                and transport in many.body systems by solving simultaneously the                classical equations of motion of N particles, where N is a large                number.  From the experimental point of view, much effort has                   been invested to prepare thin films and novel materials using                   vapor phase deposition techniques.  In spite of the considerable                importance that the growth of thin films has in basic and applied               condensed matter physics, only limited effort has been dedicated                to its theoretical understanding.  Most of the work to date                     relies on phenomenological models relying on a variety of                       parameters which are hard to determine experimentally.  Some                    limited amount of numerical simulation has also been performed                  mostly using Monte Carlo (MC) methods.  For the growth of thin                  films however dynamics is of key importance and MC methods are                  not well suited to study the dynamical behavior.  It is therefore               of importance to perform MD studies in order to understand the                  role dynamics has in thin film growth.  In many cases, numerical                simulation can also provide a guide to experimental studies.  The               reason for this is that in numerical studies it is possible to                  change parameters independently so that the relative importance                 of one parameter with respect to others can be ascertained.  Here               they propose to use MD to stimulate and study a variety of                      problems regarding the vapor phase growth of thin films as well                 as a variety of surface related problems.",
