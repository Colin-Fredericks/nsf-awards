 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this work is to build upon and implement a recently            begun theory of the cognitive processes of expert software                      engineers.  Specifically the principal investigator will address the            issue of how designers are able to mentally simulate designs-                   in-process during the early stages of the design process when the               design is only vaguely specified.  The work has implications for                design theory and methodology; the principal investigator expects               that it will be useful in understanding, supporting, and automating             the design process.                                                                  The model of the software designer will be implemented using               cognitive modelling techniques; but the implementation will be built            on Soar, a new production system architecture.  This is a novel                 combination of methodologies that will generate theoretical and                 applied issues of interest to engineering, systems architecture,                artificial intelligence, and cognitive science.                                      This award is made under the program for Expedited Awards for              Novel Research.",
