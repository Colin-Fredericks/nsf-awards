 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research deals with the problem of interpretation of the results           of a particular kind of field soil test.  The overall problem                   involves the difficulty of measuring relevant soil properties for use           in the design of foundations for buildings, stability of deep                   excavations, and other similar problems where shearing stresses                 develop in the soil.  The usual procedures for solving such problems            involve withdrawal of soil samples from the ground and performance of           relevant tests in the laboratory.  Unfortunately, the act of taking             the samples results in significant changes in the soil properties,              leading to designs which are often uneconomical, but are occasionally           unsafe.  Efforts to resolve this problem have recently involved                 development of tools to test the soil in place (\"in situ\").                     Unfortunately, field conditions are much more complex than those in             the laboratory and it is often unclear as to how the field data are             to be converted into realistic soil properties.                                 The PI's for this project are concerned with field measurements                 involving the pressing of a flat plate into the soil at a steady                rate.  They will use, and further develop, a theory originally                  developed by Baligh at MIT, termed the \"strain path method\", to                 predict stresses, strains, and pore water pressures around such a               penetrating plate.  In addition, they will perform laboratory tests             where plates will be penetrated into large-sized soil specimens, and            also field tests.  The costs of field tests will                                be greatly reduced through use of a field testing rig at another                university, that was funded through an NSF equipment grant.  The                theoretical work will be funded by the Air Force and the field                  and laboratory work by NSF.  The goals of the research are then                 to develop a way of converting data on plate penetration into                   soil properties for use in foundation design, leading to a                      reduction in testing costs and in the cost of foundations, and to               verify the analysis using laboratory and field tests, and case                  histories.",
