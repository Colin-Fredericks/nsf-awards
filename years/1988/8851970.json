 "awd_abstract_narration": "The senior-level electrical engineering laboratory facilities at           this institution have been upgraded to better prepare the students for          productive roles in industry.  This project provided laboratory                 workstations that allow students to integrate analysis and design               software tools with measurement instrumentation.  The integrated                workstations allow the faculty to not only cover traditional electronic         circuit problems in much greater depth, but also allow coverage of a            much broader range of topics.  The major components of the workstation          consist of the Hewlett-Packard PC Instrumentation System, an 80283-             based AT configured with a floating-point co-processor and a 71Mbyte            hard disk, and the ASYST signal analysis software.  With the                    workstations, students are able to efficiently move between analysis            and measurement which facilitates the iterative approach to circuit             design.  An additional benefit is student familiarity with automated            measurement systems similar to that found in the automatic test                 environment in industry.
