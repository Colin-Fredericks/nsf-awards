 "awd_abstract_narration": "Switching frequencies in the megahertz range are being used in the              development of power supplied for the next-generation computers and             other applications.  The internal heat generation in a transformer              core is proportional to frequency, local magnetic field strength and            material properties.  The minimum core volume required for a high-              frequency design is limited by core loss and thermal considerations,            yet no method for design optimization currently exists.  This project           considers the mechanisms of thermal-magnetic coupling and enhanced              heat transfer for transformer design.  A generic finite-element model           of a power transformer that accounts for coupling between the                   temperature field, magnetic field, geometry and material properties             will be developed.  The model will be validated by an electrical                energy balance to determine core and winding losses, and by infrared            thermal imaging to map the surface temperatures of prototype high-              frequency power transformers.                                                                                                                                   The proposed research will improve the design tools available for               high-frequency magnetics.  This work is expected to show for the first          time the impact of coupling between the magnetic and thermal fields on          design optimization.  This work will also demonstrate the performance           gains obtainable through improved heat transfer away from the                   transformer and the resulting decrease in temperature level.  Previous          work has neglected heat transfer enhancement altogether.  The results           of this research will allow industry to further advance power                   electronics technology.",
