 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will use tools of molecular biology to approach a             long-standing biological oceanographic problem.  Its major goals are            to (a) learn what kinds of bacteria dominate natural planktonic                 populations, (b) generate a bank of pure cultures of heterotrophic              oligotrophs, and (c) determine which, if any, cultures are                      representative of major components of the natural populations. Until            now, most of the naturally-occurring bacteria have not been                     phylogenetically characterized (or \"identified\") because they have              resisted attempts to culture them, precluding conventional                      identification. This project will circumvent the problem with                   state-of-the-art techniques of RNA sequencing, and DNA cloning                  to characterize microorganisms. Such work can now be done on freshly            collected material without culturing the microorganisms. This                   project will provide for (1) unambiguous identification of the                  dominant marine bacteria, in a way appropriate for comparing species            compositions of both culturable and nonculturable populations, (2)              selection of isolates that are most closely related to those                    dominating \"real\" marine populations, suitable for lab studies, (3)             the development of molecular probes to define population distribu-              tions in other locales and thus measure diversity within and between            broadly different environments, (4) the possible use of these probes            for single-cell hybridization studies for rapid microscopic                     identification of microorganisms in preserved samples from any                  marine environment.",
