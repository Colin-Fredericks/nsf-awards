 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the ways in which organizations do and do not                     change over time has recently come to the fore of the                           sociological research agenda.  Two major theoretical                            perspectives have emerged to explain how and whether                            organizations adapt to changing environments.  In the                           population ecology perspective, organizations are seen as                       adopting structural arrangements suited to the technological                    and social constraints of the environment at the time of their                  founding.  Over time and as organizations grow these                            arrangements are assumed to be increasingly difficult to                        change.  This leads to the prediction that organizations                        created in the same era will share similar structures, and that                 these structural similarities will persist over time.  The                      institutional perspective, by contrast, emphasizes the                          importance of social, legal, and political definitions as                       determinants of organizational structure.  From this vantage                    point, as such definitions change, organizations also change,                   adapting their structures to conform to prevailing                              understandings and expectations.  Thus the institutional                        prediction is that organizations at any given point in time                     will exhibit structural similarities regardless of when they                    were founded. The present research will test these differing                    predictions through a cohort analysis of colleges and                           universities.  Cohort analysis is a demographic technique that                  allows the identification of 3 separate sources of population                   change: cohort effects, produced by births and deaths of                        members with generationally defined characteristics; period                     effects, produced by births and deaths of members with                          generationally defined characteristics; period effects,                         produced by widespread adoption of new behaviors or attributes;                 and age effects, produced by natural maturation processes.  The                 present award, made under the Research Opportunities for Women                  Planning Grant Program, will support the preparation of a data                  set on characteristics of all U.S colleges and universities in                  a form suitable for cohort analysis.  The work is intended to                   demonstrate the usefulness of cohort analyis to organizational                  questions, as well as to advance our understanding of the                       determinants of organizational change.",
