 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cellulose has the potential for forming fibers and films that are much          stronger than those which are currently known.  It is proposed to               accomplish this via wet spinning of liquid crystalline solutions that           form in an ammonia/ammonium thiocyanate solvent system.  The tendency           for the chiral cellulose molecules to form cholesteric solutions can            be compensated and nematic solutions formed in their stead by                   adjusting the solvent ratio and the polymer concentration.  Research            thus far indicates that a nematic system is the preferred one from              which high strength, high modulus fibers will be formed.  In                    developing a process for producing such fibers, careful attention must          be given to both important spinning parameters and to post extrusion            conditions.                                                                                                                                                     Cellulose is a naturally occurring material which is available to               industry as wood pulp from trees or as fibers from cotton plants.               Cellulose in either form does not melt nor does it dissolve readily in          any solvent.  In order to make a useful product, such as a fiber or a           film from cellulose, one must be able to shape it by processing a melt          or a solution.  Further, it has been discovered that if very                    concentrated solutions are produced in a solvent, a very interesting            form of matter called liquid crystals may develop.  If fibers or films          are prepared from these cellulose liquid crystals, new fibers,                  fabrics, and films may be formed which are exceptionally strong and             resistant.  It is possible that the new lightweight, strong, stiff              materials or composites could replace steel and other conventional              engineering materials in many uses.",
