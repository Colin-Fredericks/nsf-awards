 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of Dr. Gerhardt's research is to gain knowledge about                  mechanisms and evolution of acoustic communication in vertebrate                animals.  In particular, the research will focus on temporal                    codes, that is, information encoded in the timing of repeated                   elements in natural communication sounds.  Dr. Gerhardt will                    carry out behavioral studies of signal (sound) structure and the                discrimination of these sounds, with both wild-type and hybrid                  animals, and he will also perform neurophysiological studies of                 the responses of auditory neurons to time patterns in sounds of                 biological relevance.                                                                                                                                           Two species of North American gray treefrogs (Hyla chrysoscelis                 and H. versicolor) will be studied.  These frogs are particularly               suitable as a model system for vertebrate sound communication                   because males of each species produce a small set of very                       stereotyped communication signals.  Females reliably respond to                 natural and synthetic (computer-generated) signals by approaching               a loudspeaker, just as they approach a calling male in nature.                                                                                                  The timing properties of the male's sounds are not learned, but                 develop normally when the frogs are raised in acoustic isolation.               The two species will be cross-mated artificially to produce                     viable hybrids, thus affording the opportunity to study genetic                 mechanisms of both calling and selective approach to sounds.                    There are extensive areas where just one species occurs, and                    other areas where both species breed in the same ponds at the                   same time, at the risk of producing sterile hybrids if they make                an error of identification.  Thus, the selectivity of females                   from areas of overlap will be compared with that of frogs from                  areas where only one species occurs.                                                                                                                            The auditory system of treefrogs has been well studied, so that a               great deal of basic information is already available as a                       foundation for the neurophysiological studies of time coding that               will be done in these two species.  In this research the results                of the behavioral experiments will guide and complement the                     neurophysiological work.                                                                                                                                        The results of this research should provide insights into                       fundamental properties of all acoustic communication systems in                 vertebrates.  The treefrog system is especially powerful in that                a combination of genetic and neurophysiological techniques can be               used in ways that would be impossible in higher animals.",
