 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geomorphologic processes associated with cataclysmic flows                 defy direct measurement.  As such, very little is understood                    regarding flow conditions, sediment transport, erosional and                    depositional threshold, and patterns of energy expenditure                      associated with these extreme hydrologic events.  Recent develop-               ments in paleohydraulic and paleohydrologic techniques provide an               avenue for quantitative exploration of these phenomena.  Late                   Pleistocene cataclysmic flooding along the Snake and Big Lost                   Rivers of southern Idaho and in the Channeled Scabland of eastern               Washington has provided an excellent field laboratory for                       application of these methodologies.  Utilizing field evidence of                maximum flow stages in conjunction with step-backwater and                      hydraulic flow routing models, we propose to reconstruct the                    hydraulics (discharge, velocity, shear stress, and unit-area                    stream power) of these flows.  It is hypothesized that these                    variables, and their spatial variations, can be directly related                to the abundant field evidence of depositional and erosional                    thresholds.  We will test these relationships at several different              scales and within different flow environments to determine their                general applicability for cataclysmically flooded terrains.",
