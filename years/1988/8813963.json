 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new physico-chemical effect is investigated in this expedited                 award.  This effect is based on electroconducting phenomenon in                 nonaqueous solvents.  The effect permits the mobilization of nonpolar,          uncharged molecules as well as electrolytes and species with wide               ranges of molecular weights.  Transport rates exceeding several                 centimeters per minute are commonly achieved.                                                                                                                   The objectives of this project are:  to study the conductive                    properties of organic compounds based on thermodynamical electron               donor strength, dielectric properties and ionization energy; to                 develop the methodology for formulating the semiconductive                      solvent media; and to investigate the transport phenomenon in                   terms of chemoelectronic mobility of chemical species based on                  electron donor/acceptor properties.  This technique has the long- term          potential of being applied to the areas of electronic                           transducers, chemical separations, photo-cells and the                          understanding of biological systems;  hence, the success of this                study could have impact on the medical, chemical,                               electronics, and instrumentation industries.",
