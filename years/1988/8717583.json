 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is clear from a number of studies of dioeceous plants                (separate male and female plants) from diverse ecosystems that                  two sexes are not equally distributed in the same microhabitats.                Yet little is understood of the physiological bases of the                      difference in distribution.  This study will test several                       hypotheses relating to the possible differences in water                        relations between sexes and their implications for productivity                 and survival.  Among the experimental techniques in this project                will be the analysis of stable isotope ratios of water                          (specifically D/H ratios) at natural abundance levels to detect                 the depths from which individual trees are extracting water.  The               information is critical as it says much about the potential for                 growth and survival of individual trees.  Since this information                is also recorded in tree rings as plants grow, our analysis                     should provide fundamental long-term information on water sources               used by plants and in combination with carbon isotope ratio                     analysis should provide an integrated measure of the productivity               to water consumption ratio under these conditions.  Among the                   applied aspects of our dioeceous species (such as poplars)                      constitute a major fraction of the tree species used for pulp                   production.  Since this study are focusing on the parameters                    affecting growth, productivity and survival, they could have                    direct application to this important industry.",
