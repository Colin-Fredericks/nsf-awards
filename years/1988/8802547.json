 "awd_abstract_narration": "Elliptic partial differential equations are an important tool in the            analysis of the behavior of physical systems.  They arise in the study          of temperature distribution, stress and deformation due to torsion,             incompressible fluid flow, electric and magnetic fields, and in many            other fields of science and engineering.  Very often their solutions            may be obtained with the aid of an electronic digital computer, and so          they are of interest to applied mathematicians, computer scientists,            and engineers alike.  The first phase of the proposed research would            formulate, implement, and then evaluate a finite difference method              designed to be most effective on elliptic boundary-value problems with          singularities of known form.  The evaluation process would consider the         method's accuracy over a population of problems, as well as determine           its computational efficiency over a range of grid sizes.  The second            phase of the project would implement vector and parallel versions of            the original scalar algorithm on a Cray X-MP/24 supercomputer.  The             performance tradeoffs between increased vector length and increased             multitasking would then be investigated.",
