 "awd_abstract_narration": "Observational evidence for dark matter on several astronomical                  scales has been accumulating over the last fifty years, beginning               with F. Zwicky's analysis of the dynamics of the Coma Cluster                   \u0131Zwicky 1933.!.  Since then, however, interpretation of this                    body of evidence has fueled controversy over the amount,                        distribution, and nature of dark matter.  The implications of a                 large portion of astronomical mass being non-luminous are                       profound and far-reaching: dark matter would affect solar system                dynamics, galaxy formation and evolution, and, indeed, the                      history and fate of the Universe itself.  The research will focus               on expanding and interpreting the body of observational evidence                for dark matter on galactic scales and studying its consequences                for galaxy dynamics.                                                                                                                                            High velocity dispersions, flat rotation curves at large radii                  and the dynamics of galaxy clusters indicate that dark matter may               be present in all types of galaxies.  The broadest goals of the                 research are three-fold:                                                                                                                                        1)  To survey and analyze the rotation curves of a large number                 of galaxies of varying morphological type to determine the amount               and distribution of any dark matter present.                                                                                                                    2)  To discover any relationships which may exist between the                   optical characteristics of a galaxy and its dark matter content.                                                                                                3)  To study, through numerical simulation, how initial                         conditions during formation may influence the                                   relationships mentioned above and how, in turn, dark matter                     distribution may influence further galaxy evolution and                         interaction.                                                                                                                                                    The research will be carried out during a one year's stay at the                University of Groningen,  The Netherlands.  The Westerbork                      Synthesis Radio Telescope will be used to make the observations.",
