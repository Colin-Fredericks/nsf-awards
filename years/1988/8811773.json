 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dolakhali is a hitherto little known dialect of Newari, a Tibeto-               Burman language of Nepal.  It is closely related to the better-                 known Kathmandu dialect of the same language, but it has                        strikingly different verb morphology, and the two dialects are                  mutually unintelligible. Products of this project include a                     grammatical description of Dolakhali and the data for a                         comparative study that will focus on the divergent                              morphosyntactic systems of the Dolakhali and Kathmandu dialects.                The primary areas for comparison are the structure of relative                  clauses and nominalizations, clause chains and the                              grammaticalization of verbs to auxiliaries, and finite verb                     morphology.  The close genetic relationship of Dolakhali and                    Kathmandu Newari, as well as the existence of written Kathmandu                 Newari texts dating back to the fourteenth century provide an                   excellent basis for a well-documented historical study, which can               contribute to the body of literature on historical syntax.  It                  may also resolve questions of the relationship of Newari to other               languages of Nepal, and it will definitely provide a data source                for future cross-linguistic studies on typologically dissimilar                 languages.",
