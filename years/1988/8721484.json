 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object of the research is to bring a quantitative analysis to               the study of the topology of the large-scale structure in the                   universe.  A computer program has been developed to measure the                 topology of the universe and it will be applied to a large number               of observational data sets and N-body simulations.  The algorithm               smoothes the data set, constructs surfaces of constant density                  (density contours) and measures the topology of the contour                     surfaces as a function of density enhancement.  The preliminary                 results obtained so far have been quite encouraging.  In many                   models (including those involving cold dark matter) the topology                of smoothed constant density enhancement at the present epoch                   reflects that present in the initial conditions.  Models with                   random phases (as might arise form quantum noise in inflationary                cosmologies) have a universal dependence of topology on density                 enhancement which can be compared with the observations.  These                 studies should provide some important new insights into the                     nature of the observed topology and its relation to the initial                 conditions that produced it.",
