 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a one year planning grant, Iowa State University mathematicians will         revise the engineering calculus sequence by incorporating modelling             and symbolic/graphical/numerical software into the curriculum.  The             planning will be done by a committee of faculty from engineering,               physical and mathematical sciences.  A calculus network of high school          community college and college/university will be established.                                                                                                   Iowa State is  similar to many mathematics departments at large state           universities in that over 90% of the calculus students are from the             client disciplines.  The project will initiate change in a deliberate           and timely manner with concurrence by the client departments.                                                                                                   In the spring of 1989, one fourth of the first semester calculus                courses will be taught under the revised curriculum.  This course will          require a small amount of programming, and will stress algorithms and           sharply focused real applications.  During the summer of 1989, the              second and third semesters of calculus will be revised within the same          mathematical framework.                                                                                                                                         Iowa State University is cost sharing with funding of in-kind services          and indirect cost reduction worth $52,535.",
