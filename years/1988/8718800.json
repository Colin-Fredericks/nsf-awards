 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is directed at understanding better the                           nature,. functioning, and significance of alternative                           compensation systems, especially profit sharing.  The potential                 importance of the topic stems from the idea that pay for                        performance may ultimately influence macroeconomic and                          microeconomic outcomes--perhaps especially as they relate to                    issues of international competitiveness.  In this connection, it                is interesting to note that Japan, Korea, and Taiwan all have                   significant bonus systems with strong profit.sharing overtones.                                                                                                 At the present stage, unfortunately, the promise of profit                      sharing remains largely hypothetical because we do not                          yet understand nearly well enough the economic foundations for                  preferring one payment system over another.  The current research               is primarily an application of economic theory, which will                      improve understanding of important aspects of profit sharing in                 four areas.  The first application will calculate the                           socially optimal degree of profit sharing by trading off income                 stability of those already employed against losses due to                       unemployment risk.  The second application will calculate the                   effect of gain-sharing arrangements, which introduce greater                    possibilities for flexibility or reversibility, on the                          appropriate project-evaluation investment criteria that should be               used for public enterprises.  A third application will                          investigate various conditions under which profit sharing or pay                for performance may influence work effort.  The fourth                          application contrasts the effects of wage and sharing systems on                labor market segmentation.",
