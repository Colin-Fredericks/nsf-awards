 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support a study of a variety of related                    naturally-occurring processes involving the interaction of high-                energy electrons with electromagnetic waves and with plasma waves               in the solar-terrestrial environment.  These processes are                      important for our understanding of solar-flare-related radiation                emitted from the sun's lower corona and from the solar wind, and                for our understanding of the propagation, stability and emission                properties of electron streams, including streams of solar                      origin, high-energy electrons in the ambient solar wind, electron               beams produced near planetary bowshocks, and precipitating                      electrons in Earth's auroral zones.                                                  It is intended investigate a variety of wave instabilities                 driven by electron velocity anisotropy (\"whistler-beam-modes\",                  whistlers, \"Weibel\" modes, etc.), and by parallel energy                        inversion (electron plasma waves, etc.).  The nonlinear evolution               of waves and electron distributions in magnetized plasmas, such                 as the aurora and the lower solar corona, will be treated using                 state-of-the-art supercomputer simulations.  It is expected to                  produce the first three-dimensional studies of fully-developed                  strong plasma wave turbulence excited by electron streams in the                solar wind during Type III events, and by electron beams near                   Earth's bowshock.  The proposed research emphasizes basic plasma                processes which are strongly rooted in satellite observations of                waves and particles.",
