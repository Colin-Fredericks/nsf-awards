 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to study the biodegradation of                 xenobiotic organic compounds in a process that could be used to                 reduce the concentration of these compounds in industrial and                   agricultural wastewaters.                                                                                                                                       Contamination of water by zenobiotic and toxic organic compounds                occurs when industrial or agricultural wastes have been disposed of             in leaking landfills or inadvertently discharged into the environment.          Biodegradation of these organic compounds in engineered treatment               systems is one important method of cleaning up water which has                  been polluted with toxic organic compounds.  In this research                   project, the investigators plan to work on biodegradation of two                types of xenobiotic organic chemicals in Sequencing Batch Reactor               (SBR) systems and in flask microbiological experiments, examining               the effect of cell recycle and a supplemental carbon source on the              rate of degradation.                                                                                                                                            Results of this work are likely to be utilized in the engineering               design of biological reactor processes and their incorporation in               systems to reduce the pollutional effect of wastewaters from                    industrial processes on surface and groundwater.",
