 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research activity is supported under the \"Research Opportunities           for Women--Planning Grant Program\".  The purpose of this program is to          provide an opportunity for women, who have never been the recipient of          a federal award, to undertake preliminary work to determine the                 feasibility of a line of research.  This award will allow the                   investigator to begin to develop a theoretical model of producer                decision-making under collective contracts recently introduced as a             reform in Soviet agriculture.  The new system alters incentives for the         use of resources in ways that are amenable to analysis with                     principal/agent theory that has grown out of inquiry into the nature of         share cropping and other forms of land tenure and agricultural                  contracting.                                                                                                                                                    This line of research focusing on agricultural reform in the Soviet             Union is both important and timely.  Glasnost may have profound                 long-term effects on U.S./Soviet relations.  Each stage of the Soviet           attempt at restructuring gives us an observation of a centrally planned         economy in transition to a form as yet unknown.  Both the transition of         the soviet system and its final from is of great practical and                  scientific interest, since the soviet economy is large and becoming             more integrated into world capital and natural resource markets.  This          is particularly true in agriculture where reform will affect our                theoretical understanding of agricultural growth and development, and           where reform may also have a major impact on U.S. agricultural prices           and exports.",
