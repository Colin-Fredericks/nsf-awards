 "awd_abstract_narration": "In his initial research, Dr. Pangrle found more powerful models                 and new insights upon which to base a high-level synthesis                      system.  His goal is to develop a design automation system which                will synthesize optimized designs based on the user's behavioral                description and design level constraints.  This research concerns               two issues in high-level digital design synthesis:  behavioral                  description languages and design generation.  His component model               serves as a unifying thread that will influence the development                 of the entire system from the bottom up.  Research on the                       behavioral description language and its compiler incorporates a                 new flow-graph model based on the component model.  Research on                 the design generator involves development of new algorithms for                 allocation of operations in the flow-graph, and for a                           connectivity binder that binds components to the flow-graph.",
