 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide partial support for Dr. Jon Takemoto of                 Utah State University to conduct collaborative research for eleven              months in Japan with Dr. Tokichi Miyakawa of Hiroshima University.              Their research will be on the mechanisms of toxin - cellular                    membrane interaction.  They will study the mode of action of the                phytotoxin, syringomycin on the yeast, Rhodosporodium toluroides,               focusing on the phosphorylation of plasmamembrane proteins and the              regulation of cellular calcium concentration.                                                                                                                   An understanding of and ability to regulate enzymes associated with             cellular plasma membranes would have broad implications regarding               the mechanisms of plant growth and development, as well as plant                pathogenic phenomena.  Dr. Miyakawa is an authority on the                      molecular mechanisms in the yeast R. toluroides.  His laboratory in             the Department of Fermentation Technology at Hiroshima University               has the facilities to grow and handle this organism, together with              expertise in the procedures for purifying plasma membranes and                  kinases, and assaying protein phosphorylation.  Dr. Takemoto has                been investigating the structure and mode of action of syringomycin             for the past five years.  Collaboration with Dr. Miyakawa will                  enable integration of techniques and a testing of hypothesis across             different organisms.",
