 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports several short visits by Dr. C. T. Kelley of                 North Carolina State University to the University of Trier, Federal             Republic of Germany, for collaborative research on pointwise                    quasi-Newton methods with Dr. E. W. Sachs.  Their joint work has                already produced new algorithms for solution of nonlinear problems              in integral equations, differential equations, and control.  They               will continue their collaboration with emphasis on highly nonlinear             problems, global convergence, and analysis of discretization                    strategies.  The strengths of Dr. Kelley in nonlinear equations and             of Dr. Sachs in optimal control and optimization, together with a               joint strength in functional analysis, are important to the                     continued success of this research.                                                                                                                             Quasi-Newton methods are iterative schemes for solution of nonlinear            equations and optimization problems.  They have become a powerful               tool for rapidly convergent calculations on computers.  Such methods            are useful when Newton's method is impossible or too costly to                  implement, for example, when the Jacobian matrix can not be computed            at reasonable cost.  Performance of these methods can be enhanced if            the structure of the problem is taken into account.  Drs. Sachs and             Kelley have been studying a new class of methods that consider                  structure when the problem is a discretization of an infinite                   dimensional problem, such as a differential equation or optimal                 control problem.  The methods considered perform better than                    application of standard methods to a finite dimensional                         approximation of the original continuous problem.",
