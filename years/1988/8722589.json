 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds research to develop improved methods for using risk            comparisons in risk communications.  Risk comparisons, which compare            the estimates of risk from one source to those from another source, are         intuitively appealing as a means for aiding the communication and               understanding of risk estimates.  However, past applications have been          criticized because they failed to account for qualitative differences           between risks (e.g., discrete vs. continuous risk sources) and because          they ignored important attributes that affect risk perception (e.g.,            voluntary vs. involuntary exposure).                                                                                                                            The proposed research plan includes the development of a conceptual             model for guiding the identification and evaluation of risk comparison          methods.  The conceptual model will summarize available information             regarding the communication process and include explicit evaluation             criteria.  Using the example of health risks from electromagnetic               fields, a set of risk comparisons will be developed for illuminating            specific aspects of risk.  Focus groups, which involve in-depth                 interviews with selected participant groups, will be conducted to test          the effectiveness of the methods and to collect additional information          concerning (a) how characteristics of the affected population should            influence the selection of a risk comparison method, (b) what                   characteristics of the risk source typically determine the choice of            reference risks, and (c) how                                                    uncertainties in risk estimates should be presented.  On the                    basis of these results, an implementation strategy and evaluation               criteria for the use of risk comparisons will be recommended.                   This information will be of use to risk analysts, decision                      makers, and others who must communicate risk information.",
