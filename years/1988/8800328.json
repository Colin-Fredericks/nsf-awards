 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program is in the general area of                                     metallacarboranechemistry. Metallacarborane compounds are of                    substantial current interest because of the unusual types of                    chemical bonds which they illustrate, and are also of practical                 importance because they are precursors to important ceramics                    and can be used to synthesize new materials with interesting                    electrical properties, such as one-dimensional conductors.                                                                                                      The major emphasis of the project is the synthesis of extended                  main group heterocarborane systems that may exhibit interesting                 structural, electrical and spectral properties. New                             charge-transfer complexes of main group heterocarboranes will                   be synthesized and their structures obtained. Of particular                     interest for these complexes are the factors which influence                    the slippage of the apical heteroatom, the orientation of                       ligands bound to this apical heteroatom, and the effect of                      ligand basicity on cluster bonding and structure. Also to be                    explored are new areas of chemistry suggested by previous work                  on the M(II)-inserted closo- and M(IV)-sandwiched                               commo-carboranes (M=Si and Ge). This will include the synthesis                 of several multilevel stacked silicon, germanium and mixed                      silicon/germanium sandwiched complexes and a study of their                     electrical properties. The final area of heterocarborane                        chemistry to be explored is direct synthetic approaches to                      extend, exploit and develop reactions of main group                             heterocarboranes in which the apical heteroatom undergoes                       predominantly nonreductive substitution reactions with a                        variety of main group and transition metals.",
