 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides for Dr. Wenke and his collaborators to                    conduct one season of archaeological excavation at the site of                  Kom el-Hisn, an Old Kingdom settlement located in Egypt's                       western delta.  The site dates from approximately 2686 to 2040                  BC.  The site is important because in contrast to most                          archaeological sites studied from this period, it represents a                  rural community where people lived rather than a more impressive                but less representative ceremonial site.  The investigators plan                to continue their excavation at the site to recover ceramics                    and other cultural remains which will allow them to date                        the occupation more exactly and trace changes in the settlement                 overtime.  They will also collect floral and faunal remains                     which will permit them to reconstruct the subsistence of                        the inhabitants.                                                                                                                                                Progress to date has been excellent.  The team has                              recovered materials for radiocarbon dating, ceramics, abundant                  food remains and also large numbers of clay seals.  During the                  next season they hope to continue excavations to provide                        additional information on architecture, craft production,                       exchange, economy and settlement pattern.  They will also conduct               geological studies and use satellite imagery to set Kom el-Hisn                 in a broader regional content.                                                                                                                                  This research is important because it will help anthropologists                 to understand the process by which complex civilizations arose.                 While much is known about \"high\" ancient Egyptian                               civilization, little is understood about the process which led to               this phenomenon in large part because the sites which would                     provide this information are not spectacular in nature.  What                   this project will do is help to fill in this gap and increase                   our understanding of the forces which give rise to civilizations                such as our own.",
