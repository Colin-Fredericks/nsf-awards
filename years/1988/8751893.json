 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent technological advances and a growing awareness of the                    importance of teaching statistical reasoning provide us an                      opportunity to simultaneously advance the state of educational                  technology and the high school mathematics curriculum.  Our past                two years' of research on the role of technology in the teaching                of statistical reasoning have led us to focus on methods for                    making inherently abstract statistical concepts more concrete and               therefore more accessible and comprehensible. To implement and                  test these ideas, system called ELASTIC:  An Environment for                    Learning Abstract Statistical Thinking, will be developed.  The                 system's pedagogical power will derive from new techniques for                  visualizing and manipulating abstract statistical entities.                     Students will be able to interact with concrete representations                 of statistical objects such as distributions and statistical                    processes such as sampling.  They will perform experiments in                   video-and computer-based statistical microworlds.  Their analysis               process will be guided by a planning environment that will                      include concrete representations of statistical plans.  The                     system will be tested in the context of a semester-long high                    school course on Reasoning Under Uncertainty.  In parallel, the                 system will also be used in more controlled settings as a tool                  for understanding the misconceptions students retain about                      statistical thinking.",
