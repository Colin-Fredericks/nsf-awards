His previous studies have                   analyzed the evolutionary relationships of the beetles, as well                 as the patterns of associations with fungal species.  The                       proposed project would complete his systematic description and                  classification of the North American representatives of the genus                                                                                               Agathidium, and would contribute to the large database Wheeler                  has constructed for fungal-insect interactions.                                         The proposed research has implications beyond the limits of             beetle taxonomy.  Wheeler's research will establish whether or                  not closely related beetles tend to specialize on the same fungal                                                                                               species, and how the characteristics of each beetle group provide                                                                                               for utilization of its particular food resource.  Wheeler will                  also be investigating new ways to use the early larval                          characteristics of the beetles to reconstruct their evolutionary                relationships.",
