 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides for the purchase of a large (200 liter)                   fermenter to complement smaller fermenters already available at the             University of Arizona, as well as support for an initial exploratory            study of oxygen transport.  The fermenter allows studies of scale               effects in fermenter operation under various conditions.  In                    particular, research is underway to study the spatial distribution of           mixing and transport in fermenters leading to a sound foundation for            fermenter design.  Several studies have shown that poor distribution            of oxygen and nutrient substrates can reduce cell growth rate and               yield of desired product, particularly proteins.  In order to achieve           optimum mixing rates which do not rupture the cells, it is necessary            to know how transport rates (ka), mixing and shear are distributed in           the vessel at various impeller rotation rates and for various impeller          designs.  This will be achieved by measuring local values of dissolved          oxygen and oxygen content of gas bubbles at the same locations to               obtain a spatial distribution of each.                                                                                                                          Detailed determinations of flow distributions of liquid and gas will            then be used to compute local ka distributions under various operating          conditions and designs.  As a result of this research, scale-up will            become more accurate, since distributions of ka values and how they             vary with scale will be available.",
