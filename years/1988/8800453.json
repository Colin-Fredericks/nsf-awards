 "awd_abstract_narration": "The behavior of fluids confined between solid surfaces and in                   micropores is studied in a comprehensive research program consisting            of three closely coordinated parts:  (1) molecular dynamics, (2)                molecular theory and (3) experimentation.  The availability of                  supercomputers allows the simulation of interesting and realistic               fluid-solid systems and enables the researchers to handle the                   complicated nonlinear integral and integrodifferential equations                characteristic of modern density functional theories of structure,              stress, flow and transport in inhomogeneous fluids.  A surface force            apparatus is used to measure solvation forces (normal stresses) and             squeezing flows of microscopically confined fluids.  Pressure drop              techniques are used to study Poiseuille flow in uniform microscopes,            and a pulsed field gradient spin echo NMR technique is used to study            self diffusion in microporous media.  A special aspect of the research          program is the close coupling and coordination of supercomputer-aided           molecular simulation, theory and experimentation.                                                                                                               Progress in this research area will enable better design of:  wetting           and spreading agents; lubricants; stable colloidal dispersions                  membranes; microporous solids for heterogeneous catalysis and                   electrochemistry sol-gel ceramics; molecular sieves; and coal                   gasification processes.  The ultimate goal of the project is to                 provide the understanding and models needed to engineer special                 purpose materials and processes at a molecular level.",
