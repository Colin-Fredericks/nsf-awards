 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center proposes a two-week intensive              training/education session for twenty students.  In addition to                 instruction in the mechanics of effective use of a vector                       supercomputer, students will be exposed to other aspects of the field           such as multiprocessing, numerical methods, data communications,                graphics, and an assesment of future trends.  Lectures from                     practicing computational researchers will be included.                                                                                                          The course will focus on the use of the PSC's Cray XMP48                        supercomputer.  Each student will have a DEC Vaxstation 2000 graphics           workstation which will be connected to the PSC system.                                                                                                          The students will be divided into three teams, each of which will               have a major coding project to complete during the two weeks of the             Institute.  To insure the interest of all students, the projects will           focus on the solution of partial differential equations in fluid                dynamics, a mathematical technique used in many scientific and                  engineering disciplines and common in advanced computations.                                                                                                    This is a strong proposal; an award in the amount of $40,000 is                 recommended.",
