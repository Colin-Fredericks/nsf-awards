 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County holds the                 second largest collection of marine mammal specimens in the                     United States as well as one of the largest collections of                      ungulates (hoofed mammals).  These collections have grown at an                 exponential rate over the past two decades and are now housed at                an off-site facility.  The specimens are of great scientific                    value; however, previous funding constraints and limited staffing               have prevented them from being properly documented, prepared, and               stored.  The research collection of marine mammal specimens is of               particular scientific importance because so little is known about               the general biology of these animals.  The majority of marine                   mammal specimens have beeen collected from dead, stranded                       animals, but the collection also includes animals killed                        accidentally in fishing operations, and hunted by aboriginal                    peoples.  These specimens contribute to our knowledge of the                    distribution, natural history, anatomy, and evolution of the                    various specimens.  Data gathered from these specimens also are                 used to answer many of the questions regarding the direct and                   indirect impact of man upon these aquatic mammals.                                   This project will provide additional staff to continue the                 process of curating the backlog of previously collected specimens               so they are properly cleaned, documenting and cross referencing                 the associated data, and storing both specimens and data so they                are readily available for scientific study.  The project also                   provides additional equipment to adequately store and move large,               fragile specimens.",
