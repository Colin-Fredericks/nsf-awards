 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports postdoctoral visitors at the Courant                 Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University.  The                 postdoctoral program will expose young scholars to the mix of                   analysis and applied mathematics research ongoing at the                        Courant Institute.  The Courant Institute embraces a number of                  fields that are linked to mathematics with researchers working                  in physics, engineering, biology, and several other branches of                 science.  An area of particular strength at the Courant                         Institute has long been the theory of partial differential                      equations studied both in itself and in connection with                         specific applications.  Many of the postdoctoral visitors                       coming to the Courant Institute are interested in extending                     their knowledge in partial differential equation or in one of                   its many applications.                                                               The scientific excellence of the Courant Institute has                     been recognized in many ways.  Seven of the faculty have been                   elected to membership in the United States Academy of Sciences,                 and several have been elected to the national academies of                      other countries.  Many prizes and honors, such as the Birkoff                   Prize, the Crafoord Prize of the Royal Swedish Academy, the                     Wolf Prize, two MacArthur Foundation Prize Fellowships, and                     other prizes of professional societies and of the National                      Academy have been awarded in recent times to members of the                     faculty.                                                                             This project provides support for four postdoctoral                        appointments of young investigators to study in mentorial                       relationship with senior faculty at the Courant Institute of                    Mathematical Sciences.",
