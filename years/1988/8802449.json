 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research on ammonia                             synthesis catalysts to be conducted by Dr. Michel                               Boudart of Stanford University and Prof. Daniel                                 Loffler of the University of Mar del Plata, Argentina.                          Ammonia is synthesized on reduced-iron catalysts.                               Even a small improvement in the process would have                              considerable economic impact as the need for nitrogen                           fertilizers grows with the need to feed a growing                               world population.  In this work, commercial catalysts                           will be characterized using an array of modern                                  techniques including Auger and Mossbauer                                        spectroscopies, and electron microscopy.  X-ray                                 absorption (XAS) will be used to study the structure                            of the catalysts in situ while the reaction is taking                           place.  A better understanding of the catalyst will                             help the formulation of better catalysts.                                                                                                                       The ex-situ (Auger, SEM and Mossbauer)                                          characterization will take place in Argentina and the                           XAS work will be done at Stanford.  In this way the                             facilities of each laboratory will complement those of                          the other. Both of the researchers have had extensive                           research experience in catalysis: Dr. Boudart                                   particularly in ammonia synthesis and XAS techniques                            and Prof. Loffler in the other techniques and in                                ammonia synthesis, as well.  Therefore, they will                               benefit from each other's expertise and from the                                shared laboratory capabilities.",
