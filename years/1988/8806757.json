 "awd_abstract_narration": "A perennial problem in social psychology and political science                  concerns the apparent lack of consistency in the political                      opinions expressed by individuals.  Slight changes in the                       wording of survey questions or in their order can have                          dramatic effects on the consistency and stability of expressed                  opinions.  Accordingly, a central concern has been to examine                   the factors that affect the consistency of expressed political                  attitudes.  A leading candidate in this regard is a                             respondent's level of political information and sophistication:                 Those who are more sophisticated express more consistent and                    stable political attitudes.                                                                                                                                     An assumption that guides this research is that when an                         individual responds to a political survey question, he or she                   retrieves some relevant information from memory that is then                    used in constructing an appropriate response.  Following this                   assumption, differences in response consistency and stability                   associated with political sophistication must be due in part to                 differences in the way political information and evaluations                    are organized in memory.                                                                                                                                        Using procedures recently developed in cognitive psychology,                    this work will examine differences due to political                             sophistication or expertise in how political information is                     stored and organized in memory.  Not only do the researchers                    believe that the political expert simply has more relevant                      political information stored in memory, but it also seems                       likely that that information is more tightly organized and more                 readily available to inform responses to political survey                       questions.                                                                                                                                                      By building a model of how political information and                            evaluations are organized in memory, and how that organization                  varies as a function of political sophistication, this research                 will help us better understand both theoretical issues in the                   domain of political cognition and practical issues in the                       assessment of public opinion.",
