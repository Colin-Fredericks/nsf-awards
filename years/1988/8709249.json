 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry provides                     support for the research of Dr. Edward Arnett, Duke University.                 The work is focused on the structure-energy relationships which                 characterize the aggregation and reactivity of organic anions                   in solution. Understanding such relationships is essential for                  a complete construction of the interactions between reactants                   and solvents in solution.                                                                                                                                       The following processes will be studied: (1) the energies for a                 number of fundamental processes such as heats of interaction of                 lithium cation with neutral ligands such as ethers, esters,                     ketones, aldehydes, and amines and with enolate, phenolate and                  alkoxide ions; (2) heats of reaction of direct relevance to the                 important reactions of lithium enolates such as the aldol and                   Michael condensations; (3) the degrees of aggregation for                       selected enolate ions in a spectrum of solvents of varied                       polarity --cyclohexane, benzene, dioxane, DMSO and sulfolane--                  by freezing point depression  (such results will be related to                  x-ray crystal structures, heteronuclear NMR, heats of                           complexing and, in favorable cases, to kinetic analysis of                      alkylation or aldol reactions); (4) equilibration of                            carbocations, carbanions, and radicals where thermodynamics and                 kinetics for single electron transfer may be compared directly                  with coordination (two electron transfer).",
