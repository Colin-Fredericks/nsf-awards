 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves developing a translator from procedural                  programming languages (starting with Fortran) into the equational               specification language-MODEL.  This is called \"Software Reverse                 Engineering\" (SRE).  It is coupled with the existing MODEL system that          translates equational specifications in MODEL into highly efficient             programs in PL/1, C or Ada (generation of programs in Fortran is in             development).  Together these two systems provide an automated                  conversion path from old to new operational environments.  The                  significance of this project is also in use of the MODEL equational             language specifications to achieve much easier understanding of                 programs.  This aspect is very important in attaining maintenance,              improvements, higher reliability and better efficiency of programs.             Another important aspect is use of SRE for conversion to parallel               computers.  The proposed Phase I work consists of design of algorithms          and testing of the concept through examples.",
