 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks support to convene a national workshop on              the origin of destructive earthquakes in the eastern United                     States.  The conference will emphasize the discussion on several                fundamental aspects regarding the tectonic origin of                            intracontinental earthquakes, and on planning and coordination of               future research on intracontinental seismicity.                                                                                                                      Since plate tectonics does not provide a useful framework for              studying deformation in plate interiors, intracratonic tectonism                presents a major challenge for basic geosciences.  The occurrence               of large intracontinental earthquakes also poses complex problems               for applied sciences in determining seismic risk and mitigating                 earthaquake hazard.                                                                                                                                                  We submit that a conference on intracontinental seismicity is              timely.  Results and ideas from diverse disciplines pertinent to                this field of renewed interest in geoscience need to be compared                and tested.  Outside of basic goescience, groups which interact                 with this field such as users of the information (e.g., earthquake              engineers), policy makers and funding agencies need to be made                  aware of the latest results and the issues rising in this rapidly               evolving field.                                                                                                                                                      We propose to organize a conference to be held on April 12                 and 13, 1988 at the Illini Union of the University of Illinois at               Urbana-Champaign.  The main purpose of this conference will be to               critically assess our current knowledge on intracontinental                     seismicity.  We plan to host about 40 scientists from diverse                   fields pertinent to the study of seismicity in the eartern U.S.,                with emphasis on earthquake seismology, solid-earth geophysics,                 structural geology, and tectonics.",
