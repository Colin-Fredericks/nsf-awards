 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent measurements in various laboratories have established the                presence of cosmogenic 3He in terrestrial samples.  In order to                 document the production rate and production mechanism of                        cosmogenic 3He in surface rocks,the PI has engaged in a program of              measurements in geologically well-documented samples. Recent                    measurements in radiocarbon dated lava flows show that the 3He                  production rate has varied by up to the factor of three within the              last 10,000 years.  The variations may be related to changes in                 the earth's dipole moment, which modulates the cosmic ray flux.                 In order to test this hypothesis, new measurements will be carried              out on radiocarbon dated flows from various latitudes.  The                     available data suggest the cosmogenic 3He will become a powerful                tool for measuring exposure ages, which will have important                     applications to glacial geology and possibly paleomagnetism.                    Calibration of the technique will also include new measurements on              previously dated glacial morraines from Antarctica collected                    specifically for this purpose.",
