 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to  elucidate the structure-                  function relationships involved in the interaction between the                  pituitary hormone prolactin and its cellular receptor.                          Escherichia coli cells have been engineered to synthesize                       bovine methionyl-protactin.  The bacterially-produced hormone                   is fully  active in the Nb2 cell bioassay for lactogenic                        hormones.  Comparison of the published amino acid sequences of                  ten lactogenic hormones aligned so as to maximize homology                      reveals that there are approximately 30 sites at which the                      same amino acid is conserved.  Bovine growth hormone, which is                  not a lactogenic hormone, and is inactive in the Nb2 cell                       bioassay, has a different amino acid present at only six of                     these sites.   In this study site directed mutagenesis                          techniques will be used  to introduce specific amino acid                       changes at these six positions.  Mutant hormones will be                        isolated, and their bioactivities analyzed.                                          Prolactin is an important hormone excreted by the anterior                 pituitary gland.  It regulates growth and development of the                    mammary gland and is essential for the production of milk.  The                 results of this research will provide useful information on how                 prolactin functions at the molecular level.",
