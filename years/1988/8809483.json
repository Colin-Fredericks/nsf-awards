 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to construct a comprehensive                   computer-aided design methodology for multi-rate digital control                systems that differs from existing schemes in one or more of five               points:  1) Effectiveness - It will be guaranteed to find a controller          that meets the desired specifications if one exists.  2) Naturalness -          The use of an intelligent control specification language compiler will          allow designers to refer directly to transfer functions, signal                 peaks, noises powers, step responses, etc.  3) Flexibility - The                designer will be allowed to express constraints or optimize on signal           peaks, noise powers, frequency domain behavior of transfer functions,           time domain behavior of pulse responses, settling times, overshoots,            and more.  4) Generality - It will handle asynchronous systems,                 rigorously.  5) Tractability - Design of large systems will be                  possible with available computing power.  Designed controllers will be          of reasonable order for implementation.                                                                                                                         This will be accomplished by extending ordinary, single-rate                    \"Q-Design\" to multi-rate control systems, developing and coding                 analytical, rigorous methods for approximating asynchronous systems             with synchronous ones and methods for model reduction of multi-rate             controllers.                                                                                                                                                    The widespread industrial and military use of multi-rate digital                control systems and the shortcomings of current design methodologies            means this research should have significant impact in the practicing            control community.",
