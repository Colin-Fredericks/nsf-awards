 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accumulation of sterols and sesquiterpenoids have been                          correlated with changes in the activity level of particular                     branch point enzymes of the isopernoid biosynthetic pathway,                    squalene synthetase and sesquiterpene cyclase.  The next                        obvious question is whether these enzyme activities are                         regulated by the absolute amounts of the enzyme proteins.                       Both enzymes are to be purified, antibody probes for each                       generated, and the absolute amount of each protein                              determined.  The subcellular distribution of an enzyme                          activity common to both pathways, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl                    coenzyme A reductase, and those activities unique to each,                      squalene synthetase and sesquiterpene cyclase, will be                          determined in tobacco cells fractionated by conventional                        biochemical methods.  Experiments measuring the in vivo                         incorporation rate of radioactive mevalonate, isopentenyl                       pyrophosphate, and farnesyl pyrophosphate into sterols and                      sesquiterpenoids, and subsequent in vitro enzyme assays will                    identify other regulated, and thus potentially limiting,                        enzyme activities.%%%                                                                                                                                           Plant isoprenoids comprise a wide range of compounds of                         physiological importance (ie. plant growth hormones), as well                   as of agricultural (ie. flavor and aroma constituents) and                      pharmaceutical (ie. oral contraceptives) interest.  Our                         understanding of how plants regulate the production of these                    compounds is still incomplete.  The proposed work is to                         examine 3 putative mechanisms regulating the biosynthesis of                    two classes of isoprenoids, sterols and sesquiterpenoids.                       Information of this type should provide additional strategies                   for the future genetic and biotechnological improvement of                      plants for agriculture and industry.***//",
