 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lipoxygenase is a distinctive non-heme iron dioxygenase.  It                    was first observed in the seeds of leguminous plants because                    of its relative abundance there and its ability to carry out                    certain easily observed catalytic transformations.  In spite                    of this, a physiological role for the enzyme from these                         sources has been difficult to pinpoint.  Evidence that                          lipoxygenases are involved in two stages of plant growth and                    development, germination and senescence, has been recently                      presented and the discovery of mammalian lipoxygenases has                      led in recent years to a renaissance in investigations of the                   enzyme.                                                                                                                                                         Dr. Funk is trying to characterize a component structure of                     the enzyme that is critically related to its proposed                           mechanism of action.  While non-heme iron is believed to play                   a key role in the expression of catalytic activity of                           lipoxygenase, very little is known about the binding site for                   the atom in the protein.  The structure of the iron site will                   be studied by Mossbauer spectroscopy, a uniquely selective                      probe of the electronic environment of metals in proteins.                      The iron site will also be investigated by X-ray absorption                     spectroscopy in order to provide confirmation of the                            structural features revealed by other techniques.",
