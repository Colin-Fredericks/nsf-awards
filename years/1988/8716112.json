 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hydrogen ion translocating ATPases (H+ -ATPases) are the primary                ion pumps in the plasma membrane and tonoplast (vacuolar                        membrane) of plant cells.  Together, these enzymes play a central               role in 1) ion and metabolite transport, 2) cellular                            bioenergetics, 3) plant responses to hormones and 4) plant                      responses to environmental stimuli.  Because of the central                     importance of these enzymes in plant cell function, they are                    likely targets in molecular genetic manipulations of plant cell                 function.  This grant continues studies of the molecular basis of               H+ transport at both the plasma membrane and tonoplast of plant                 cells.  The information gained will be essential in designing and               implementing strategies to modify the regulation and function of                these enzymes.                                                                                                                                                  Progress to date includes 1) raising and characterizing                         antibodies to the plasma membrane H+ -ATPase catalytic subunit                  and to two subunits of the tonoplast H+ -ATPase, 2) identifying                 and characterizing cDNA clones from tomato encoding these H+ -                  ATPase subunits, and 3) using site-specific reagents to identify                functional domains of the H+ -ATPases.  Now, efforts will focus                 on sequencing full length cDNA or genomic clones encoding the H+                -ATPase subunits.  The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence               will used to: 1) assess structural homologies between related H+                -ATPases, 2) analyze topology of the membrane-associated H+ -                   ATPase subunits using antibodies to synthetic peptides, and 3) in               conjunction with site-specific labeling reagents, identify                      functional domains of the H+ -ATPases.  In addition antibodies                  and cloned DNA sequences will be used to examine regulation of                  expression of the three H+ -ATPase subunit genes.  The                          coordination of expression of H+ -ATPase mRNAs and protein will                 be analyzed in relation to normal development and in response to                environmental stimuli.  This basic information is critical in                   assessing the extent that regulation of H+ -ATPase genes                        contributes to the regulation of membrane function.//",
