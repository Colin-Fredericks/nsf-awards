 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intestinal epithelium of vertebrates serves an important barrier        function controlling the movement of ions, nutrients, and water into the        animal.  The major objective of the proposed project is to determine the        mechanisms by which specific ion channels in the intestinal epithelium          contribute to the transepithelial chemical and electrical potential             profiles which serve as the driving forces for absorption of ions and           nutrients.  These specific ion channels located in the apical (luminal)         and basolateral (blood side) cell membranes, together with ion                  transporters and the resistance properties of the paracellular pathway          between intestinal epithelial cells are the bases of the transepithelial        potential profiles.  Hormonal and pharmacological agents can alter              transport processes through effects directly or indirectly on membrane          channels and carriers.  Using intracellular microelectrode, patch clamp         and reconstituted membrane vesicle techniques, we will examine the              voltage- and chemical-dependence of these specific ion channels in the          teleost, goby, intestine.  These biophysical and physiological                  investigations will increase understanding of the role of the intestine         in fluid and electrolyte balance.                                                   The intestine of vertebrate animals serves not only to absorb               nutrients from food, but also to regulate salt and water balance.  This         is particularly clear in seawater-adapted fishes in which there is a            tendency for body water to be lost and salts gained from the salty              environment.  The goby is a small fish that has the physiological               ability to adapt to a wide range of salt concentrations in its                  environment, and therefore is a very useful organism in which to study          the ion transport mechanisms underlying the regulation of salt and water        balance.  Much has been learned about the transport of salts across the         whole intestine of this interesting fish, but the detailed pathways             and mechanisms of regulation of passage of ions across the membranes of         this tissue have not yet been worked out.  This study will apply the            latest methods of patch clamp electrical recording in combination with          biochemical analysis of the intracellular effects of hormones that              affect ion channels involved in salt transport.  The results of this            research will contribute significantly to our understanding of the              physiological function of intestinal cells.",
