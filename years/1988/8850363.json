 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores, develops and tests the educational possibilities         of using an integrated, multi-functional computational medium that              includes full programming capability.  Boxer defines a high-powered work        station environment for the personal and professional use of children,          teachers, and curriculum developers of the 1990s.  In a previous NSF            grant, we established the scientific basis for such a system in a               principled design, and we established the technological basis in a              field-deployable implementation.  Models of new kinds of educational            practice in school settings that are made possible by such a medium,            will be developed and tested.                                                                                                                                   These models will highlight the new and special characteristics of Boxer        that promise important changes in the ordering, content and form of             school science.  In particular, it will be demonstrated that Boxer is           transparent, allowing students and teachers to get more quickly through         the technical aspects of the system to basic mathematical and scientific        learning, and that Boxer provides dramatic synergy in allowing easy             combining of the various aspects of the system (text editing, data base         capabilities, etc.), most particularly, synergy between programming and         learning scientific principles.                                                                                                                                 Two new generalizable models of educational practice based on the use of        a computational medium will be built.  The first will teach about motion        by developing a product-oriented community practice in the classroom.           That practice will grow out of a carefully designed and integrated set          of exercise microworlds, and its effectiveness in promoting deep                conceptual change will be assessed by the capability of students to             learn more on completion of the course.  The second model will teach            topics in fact-intensive sciences like biology by using the medium to           display the hidden structure of knowledge in the domain, and by                 supporting learning and problem solving activities specifically                 appropriate to such domains.",
