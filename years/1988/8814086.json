 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the last year, a consensus has formed that there is a national             need for more and better social science research on Arctic topics.              The United States Arctic Research Plan (1987), for example, states              that \"it has become evident that the objectives of U.S. Arctic                  research policy cannot be met without a program in the social                   sciences\".  Similarly, the report of the National Science Board                 Committee on the Role of NSF in Polar Regions, states that                      \"behavioral and social sciences are obvious examples of fields in               which basic research (on Arctic topics) is not sufficient.\"  There              has been little thought devoted to devising a strategy for                      implementing this consensus nor does there exist a Federal agency               with a clear-cut mandate to support research in the social and                  behavioral sciences on Arctic topics.  An ad hoc Committee on Arctic            Social Sciences has been established within the Polar Research Board            of the National Academy of Sciences to address these problems.  The             Committee proposes to identify the principal research questions in              Arctic social sciences, recommend priorities to guide the direction             of future research in this field, and indicate the facilities and               support required for a meaningful research program.                                                                                                             This Committee brings together prominent representatives of the                 major social science disciplines to examine the options available to            formulate a strategy to fulfill the national need for social science            research on Arctic topics.  The end product will be a peer-reviewed,            action-oriented study that would identify first-order Arctic social             science problems and that would suggest a mechanism for their                   solution.  The Committee report will also highlight links between               Arctic social science research and new large-scale global systems               programs that are currently focused on the biological and physical              sciences.  Funding is to be shared by the principal federal and                 state agencies involved in the Arctic research and potentially                  include DOD, DOI, Smithsonian Institution, Department of Commerce,              State of Alaska and the North Slope Borough.",
