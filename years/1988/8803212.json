 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in modern analysis               between Dr. Isaac Namioka, Department of Mathematics, University of             Washington and Drs. C.A. Rogers and J.E. Jayne, University College              London, U.K.  The research topic proposed is \"Properties like the               Radon-Nikodym Property.\"  Dr. Namioka is a leading investigator in              this area of mathematical research, and Drs. Roger and Jane are also            internationally recognized experts in descriptive topology.                                                                                                     A compact Hausdorff space is called Radon-Nikodym compact if it is              homeomorphic to a weak compact subset of a dual Banach space with               the Radon-Nikodym property.  Although there are some open questions,            the class of Radon-Nikodym compact spaces is reasonably well                    understood.  This cooperative research proposal aims to undertake a             similar study for non-compact spaces.  During the past year, the                three investigators of the proposed project have laid a  foundation             for the study of topological spaces with Radon-Nikodym type                     properties.  They now propose to develop their theory further and to            solve those problems that have arisen in connection with the                    application of the general theory to specific spaces such as Banach             spaces with the weak topology.  The results of this research are                likely to lead to interesting applications of descriptive set theory            to the geometric-measure theoretical structure of Banach spaces.",
