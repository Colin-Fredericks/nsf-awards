 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Professor James T. Dufty of the University of            Florida to collaborate with Professor Matthieu H. Ernst and others              of the State University of Utrecht, The Netherlands in research on              mathematical models of percolation in fluids.  Their general                    objective is to gain an improved theoretical understanding of the               microscopic basis for transport properties of simple fluids.                    Diffusion is among the most fundamental of dynamical processes in               fluids and other materials.  The researchers will work first on                 random lattice models that represent diffusion as random walks on a             disordered lattice, approximating the confinement of an atom or                 particle in a dense liquid (as, for example, in percolation                     processes).  Such models are the simplest in a hierarchy of                     increasingly realistic descriptions of fluid dynamical behavior.                Results from these random lattice models will provide the basis for             a similar study of the Lorentz gas, an idealized fluid, to resolve              discrepancies between theory and computer simulations.                                                                                                          Professor Ernst and his colleagues at Utrecht possess outstanding               theoretical and computational expertise in random lattice models and            the Lorentz gas.  Professor Dufty has developed numerical and                   analytical tools for kinetic models of bound state transport                    properties.  These complementary strengths, and the overlapping                 background of the collaborators in modern kinetic theory methods,               should lead to significant progress in this area of statistical                 mechanics.  Ultimately, a better understanding of transport                     properties in systems with percolation will have value in many                  scientific disciplines and industrial applications.",
