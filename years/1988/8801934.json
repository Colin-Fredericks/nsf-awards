 "awd_abstract_narration": "Calcium ion has three effects on myxobacteria.  These are: (1) the              induction of a system for gliding motility; (2) the induction of a              system for energy-dependent cohesion; and (3) the stimulation of                synthesis of three specific polypeptides.  The long-range goal is to            purify these polypeptides, raise monoclonal antibodies, and use these           antibodies to test the hypothesis that the three polypeptides are               functionally involved in motility and/or cohesion.  The antibodies will         be used to clone the genes for genetic approaches to the question, as           direct reagents to try to inhibit motility or cohesion, and as probes           to search for crossreactive polypeptides in other gliding bacteria.             The present grant will support initiation of genetic analysis in                Stigmatella, production of monoclonal antibodies, and use of the                antibodies to affinity purify the proteins.                                                                                                                     Myxobacteria are differentiation-competent, communal procaryotes, whose         life-cycle includes single-celled, aggregating (cohesive), and                  multicellular fruiting body stages.  None of these phenomena are                understood at the molecular or mechanistic level.  The biological               system, fascinating in its own right, may well prove to be a useful             model system for studying differentiation and cell-cell interactions in         higher organisms.",
