 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Millero proposes to continue his study of how ionic                    interactions affect chemical processes in seawater and other                    natural waters. In the next two years he will examine how the                   major components of seawater affect the rates of oxidation of                   metals and nonmetals.  Measurements of the rates of oxidation                   will be made in seawater as a function of pH, salinity and                      temperature.  Kinetic measurents will also be made in mixed                     ionic solutions (Na-Mg-Ci, Na-Cl-SO4, NaC1-NaC104, etc.) at a                   constant ionic strength to elucidate the ionic interactions.                    Studies of the products and intermediates of the oxidation                      will be made in an attempt to elucidate the mechanisms of the                   reaction.                                                                            During the next two years he also plans to continue                        measurements on the oxidation of Fe(II), Cu(I) and H2S                          with H2O2 in seawater and the major sea salts.  New                             measurements will be initiated on the oxidation of H2SO3                        with H2O2.  Thermodynamic pK1 and pK2 measurements for the                      ionization of H2So3 in NaC1, NaMgC1, and KC1 will be completed                  as a function of temperature (0 to 50degrees C) and ionic                       strength (0 to 6m).  These measurements will be used to                         examine the effect of pH on the oxidation of H2SO3.                                  He will participate in field studies in the Black Sea                      (1988), direct measurements will be made on the oxidation                       of H2S in these waters to compare field measurements with                       laboratory results.  Differences are expected due to the                        coupled oxidations of Fe(II) and Mn (II) and catalytic                          effects of micro-organisms.  Laboratory measurements using                      metal saturated HS- solutions will be made to examine the                       catalytic effects that may occur in natural waters.  The                        effect various parameters have on the formation of                              intermediates SO32- will also be examined.",
