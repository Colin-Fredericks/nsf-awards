 "awd_abstract_narration": "Water movements comprising \"wave exposure\" are an important             characteristic of wave-swept rocky shores.  Although biological                 sconsequenses of exposure have been intensively studied, the                    detailed mechanism through which exposure affects biological                    processes has received less attention.  Here it is proposed to study            one important and little understood aspect of water motion, the                 transport in the nearshore region of the larvae of bottom-dwelling              species on wave-swept, rocky coasts.  The following questions are               asked:  1.  How are larvae affected by flow on a scale of                       millimeters to centimeters?  These flows may have important                     consequences for the release as well as the retention and settlement            of larvae.  2.  What predictable, larger-scale flows transport                  larvae offshore, and what flows bring them back?  3.  What are the              direction(s) and time course(s) of larval transport in the                      nearshore?  4.  How do the behaviors of larvae affect their                     transport?  Experiments will be conducted on the wave-swept, rocky              coast of Central California.",
