 "awd_abstract_narration": "All organisms possess traits that affect their ability to               survive and reproduce.  No trait exists in isolation from the                   whole organism; it is also true, however, that the overall life-                cycle strategy of a species or population is comprised of some                  traits that interact and some that do not.  Dr. Bradshaw has                    proposed that insect life cycles are composed of genetically                    coordinated traits (tactics) that may themselves be genetically                 coordinated.  He has also argued that the two fundamental                       components of an insect's life cycle are (1) direct development                 under favorable conditions and (2) dormancy or migration under                  unfavorable conditions.  Further, Dr. Bradshaw has predicted                    situations under which these fundamental components should,                     themselves, be coordinated or free to evolve independently.                             To test these predictions, Dr. Bradshaw will examine the                coordination of life-cycle traits in a mosquito that develops                   only within the water-filled leaves of the carnivorous purple                   pitcher plant from the Gulf of Mexico to north-central Canada.                  The pitcher-plant mosquito has invaded North America from South                 America, probably after the last ice age, and has evolved from                  south to north.  In studying this mosquito, Dr. Bradshaw is                     examining the invasion and adaptation of a tropical mosquito into               the temperate zone of the United States.  The tropical yellow-                  fever mosquito presently is established in our Gulf Coast States                and the Asian tiger mosquito, that can carry dengue fever and                   encephalitis viruses, has recently invaded southern and eastern                 United States.  The results of this research will thus have                     direct implications on the constraints or opportunities that                    tropical mosquitoes may have in successfully spreading to more                  northern climates in our country.",
