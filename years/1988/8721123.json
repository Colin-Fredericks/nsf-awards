 "awd_abstract_narration": "While normative models of judgment suggest that preferences                should be invariant across elicitation procedures, prior research has           shown that preferences are susceptible to many different influences.            These include changes across response modes, the compatibility of               attributes describing the alternative and response scale, and order             effects.  Because these effects contradict basic tenants of theories of         rational choice, they are of interests not only to psychologists, but           economists and management scientists as well.                                                                                                                        This proposal suggests that these effects originate from the use           of multiple underlying strategies in judgment.  Decision-makers, we             hypothesize, select among a set of simplified strategies, or heuristics         in an attempt to minimize effort while providing satisfactory level of          accuracy.  Many observed task effects may have their origins in these           changes in strategy.  The proposed research extends our work in                 modeling the effort and accuracy associated with decision strategies.           We propose a series of process-tacing studies which attempt to validate         the framework for modeling effort and error.  We also hope to                   contribute to the empirical base by providing process analysis of some          common judgmental phenomena.",
