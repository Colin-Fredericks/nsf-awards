 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research examines the development of education as an institution,          and the impact of political and economic forces on its expansion.  It           also relates educational expansion to economic growth, a central topic          in the study of the development of human capital within the labor               force.                                                                                                                                                          The objectives are (1) to extend the analysis of existing research on           models of education in the United States to Europe and (2) to extend            the time period in which they are examined (1850-1975).  The goal is to         develop a contingency theory, that is, to specify the conditions under          which human capital theory (developing skills ) or credentialling               theory (acquiring certification) are more applicable.  The contingency          of particular interest is a strong and active government (state).               Looking at four countries (Britain, France, Germany and Italy) over a           long range of time permits considerable variations in state policies,           economies and educational systems.                                                                                                                              This research offers an opportunity to broaden theories of the effects          of education on economic growth, first by generalizing across countries         and second by generalizing across time.   Finding conditions under              which educational expansion does and does not affect the economy is             important in clarifying current explanatory approaches to educational           growth.",
