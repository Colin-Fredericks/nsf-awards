 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action is for support of a workshop whose objective is the                 selection of a geotechnical test site or sites for earthquake                   engineering research and for general geotechnical engineering                   research.                                                                                                                                                       Before the foundation of a building is excavated, the site is                   characterized by means of a morphological, geological, and                      hydrological examination. The process of exploring to                           characterize or define small scale properties of substrata at                   construction sites is unique to geotechnical engineering: In                    other engineering disciplines, material properties are specified                during the design, or before construction or manufacture, and                   then controlled to meet the specification.                                                                                                                      Researchers in geotechnical engineering often require well                      characterized sites at which to perform experiments. Locating and               characterizing these sites is very time consuming (and often too                costly to justify a single inexpensive experiment) and usually                  the sites are used only for a single experiment. There is a need                to develop well characterized and instrumented sites which are                  available as a national resource to increase research                           productivity and cooperation between research groups. The                       difficulty is in locating and deciding upon general purpose                     sites, and in planning for the maintenance, management, and long                term funding of such sites. The purpose of this workshop is to                  address these issues, specifically to identify the best sites,                  define specific plans for the construction of structures and the                provision of instrumentation, and prepare cost estimates for the                development and operation of each site.                                                                                                                         The test sites will be used: (a) to study the phenomenon of soil                response to dynamic loading, especially liquefaction, (b) to                    investigate: (1) the resistance of buried pipelines to earthquake               shaking; (2) the seismic resistance of constructed facilities;                  and (3) soil-structure interaction phenomena (such as the                       performance of piles), and (c) to evaluate new tools for in situ                testing, laboratory testing, and instrumentation . The report of                the National Research Council on \"Liquefaction of Soils During                  Earthquakes\" recommends that the establishment of an experimental               test site be explored.",
