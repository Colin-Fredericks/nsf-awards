 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past decade researchers have begun to study how the public               intuitively perceives the risks of hazardous technologies.  Studies of          risk perception are today widely cited by risk managers and play an             active role in public discussions concerning risk policies.  However,           because risk perception methodology lacks a formal evaluative                   structure, it is often not clear how public input should be                     incorporated into evaluations of risky technologies or how public               concerns should be weighted as part of policy decisions regarding               choices among technologies.                                                                                                                                     The general objective of the proposed research is to facilitate the             integration of risk perception with risk evaluation approaches as part          of social risk-management policies.  The specific objective of the              research is to explore (a) the connections between psychometric risk            measures, the physical features of a technology, and sociological               concerns, and (b) the legitimacy of risk-perception concerns as                 contributors to risk evaluations.  The research will develop a better           understanding of the sources and legitimacy of perceived risk by                examining in-depth one key risk characteristic, dread and by testing a          methodology for investigating the policy appropriateness of social              concerns of risk.",
