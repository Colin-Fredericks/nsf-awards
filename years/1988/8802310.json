 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term objectives of the current studies are to                          determine how L-alanine is synthesized and used by Escherichia                  coli.  Currently, this entails a primarily molecular genetic                    approach, with utilization of transposable elements as tools                    for gene cloning, mapping and sequencing.  Because solid L-                     alanine auxotrophs cannot be isolated directly, potential                       alanine biosynthetic genes are identified by cloning wildtype                   genes that suppress a leaky alanine mutation.  These genes will                 be mapped and the DNA will be sequenced.  L-alanine is the most                 abundant amino acid in E. coli and is a component of the                        bacterial cell wall.  The synthesis of several cell membrane                    components, including a cell surface antigen associated with                    pathogenesis, is regulated by L- alanine, suggesting that this                  amino acid may be one of the bacterial cell's general                           regulatory signals.                                                                                                                                             L-alanine, the most abundant amino acid in the bacterium                        E.coli, is an essential constituent both of proteins and of the                 cell wall.  Because of its involvement in more than one                         physiological function, it regulates several diverse pathways                   of gene expression, and is itself synthesized by more than one                  pathway.  Because of these complexities, the biosynthesis of L-                 alanine and the regulation thereof have proven particularly                     refractory to genetic analysis for many years.  Using some                      novel methods, Dr. Berg has succeeded in isolating mutations in                 some of the gene involved in the biosynthesis of L-alanine, and                 has begun to study the regulation of their expression.  It has                  emerged from her preliminary work that the activity of one of                   these genes may be regulated in a novel way, viz.,  by the                      tightness of physical coiling of the DNA very near the gene.                    This is a proposal to extend these studies.  The proposed work                  should yield new insights into how a bacterial cell coordinates                 two rather disparate aspects of its physiology, and may also                    reveal previously unknown mechanisms of regulation of gene                      expression.",
