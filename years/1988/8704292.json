 "awd_abstract_narration": "The infection of dicotyledonous plants by Agrobacterium is                      perhaps the best understood plant pathogenic response at the                    molecular level.  However, many of the world's very important                   agricultural crops such as corn and rice are monocotyledonous and                                                                                                                                                                               most of them are apparently resistant to infection by                           Agrobacterium.  An understanding of the factors which mediate                   host range properties of Agrobacterium may enable the extension                 of its host range to include plants which thus far are refractory                                                                                                                                                                               to transformation.  Such understanding will also provide                        considerable insight into the mechanism of plant cell                           transformation.                                                                                                                                                 A single system will be studied, the A. tumefaciens - grapevine                 system.  The tumor inducing plasmid (Ti) of Agrobacterium                       contains a small region, the T-DNA, which, when transferred into                                                                                                and stably integrated within the nuclear DNA of the infected                    plant cell results in the growth of a tumor.  Mutations in                      another region of the Ti plasmid, the vir region, can abolish                   virulence completely.  The vir region contains at least 6                       operons, none of which, except for the virA operon, is expressed                                                                                                in the absence of plant cells.  Wounded plant cells secrete                     molecules which activate the other 5 operons.  To explain the                   role of the vir genes in host range, it will be determined                      whether different plants synthesize different molecules that                    activate vir genes in different strains of Agrobacterium.                       Plasmids of different sizes will be constructed to see if they                  are transferred with different efficiencies.  Attempts will also                                                                                                be made to construct strains of Agrobacterium with different                    combinations of low host range and wide host range T-DNA genes.                                                                                                 These strains will be tested for their ability to induce tumors                 and hypersensitivity.  Approximately 20 strains of Agrobacterium                                                                                                isolated from grapevine tumors in the Peoples Rupublic of China                 will be screened since many of these strains have a limit host                  range.  Attempts will be made to detect specific genes, e.g.,                   virA, in these isolates, which are found in the low standard low                                                                                                host range strains; to determine whether of not their host range                                                                                                can be expanded by the addition of selected genes from the wide                 host range strain.                                                                                                                                              These studies should result in a clearer insight into the                       molecular aspects of host range determination in Agrobacterium as                                                                                                                                                                               well as into aspects of the early stages of plant cell                          transformation specifically related to host range.",
