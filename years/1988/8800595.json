 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social scientists have long sought to explain both the                     variation of criminality and personal victimization across                      individuals and, as importantly, across time and space.  Despite                the fact that numerous studies of structural covariates of crime                rates for various subnational units have been published over the                past several decades, little is known about the extent to which                 empirical relationships found in one study with one level of                    analysis and at one particular point in time generalize to other                levels of analysis at other time points.  To date, most studies                 focusing on crime rate variation have capitalized on rather                     unique patterns of association related to particular samples.                        In this research, Drs. Land and Cohen examine the social                   structural (economic, demographic, social) determinants of crime                rates across levels of aggregation and time.  They will use a                   data set created as part of a previous NSF project which contains               information on seven FBI Index crimes and numerous structural                   covariates for 1960, 1970, and 1980 and at three levels of                      aggregation (cities, SMSA, states).  Several statistical                        techniques will be used to test the empirical regularities                      between social indicators and crime rates.  On the basis of an                  assessment of the status of each covariate, additional thought                  and work will go into consideration of possible aggregation                     effects that might account for discrepancies across the levels.                      The research should result in the most comprehensive study                 of crime rates in the U.S. over this period.  In addition, the                  questions that will be addressed are fundamental to theory                      construction and methodology in criminological research.  As a                  contribution to theory, the study will provide tests of the                     constancy in relationships offered by proponents of several                     different causal orientations.  As a contribution to methodology,               it will demonstrate the inherent limits to regression-based                     explanations of crime rates and the problem of using highly                     correlated measures to understand differences in crime rates.                   Also, the study should add to research practice by inspecting                   relationships between panel and cross-sectional models.",
