 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an investigation of the physical chemistry of                   metallurgical slags in iron and steel making processes.  The first              part of the study deals with the removal of tramp elements from                 liquid iron and the second part of the study deals with the influence           of surface-active solutes on the surface tension of slag melts.                 These will be elaborated on  briefly in that order in the following.            The production of ultra-low C, S and P steels requires that ladle               metallurgy be incorporated as an integral part of the steelmaking               process.  However, current ladle metallurgy practice does not provide           for the removal of the so-called tramp elements which occur in                  recycled scrap steel charged to the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF).                 These elements include Sn, Pb and Cu which cannot be removed from               steel by selective oxidation into the slag.  The increased production           of continuously-cast steel has decreased the availability of in-house           scrap, and hence has increased the extent to which external scrap               must be used.  In this project an experimental study will be made of            the extent to which Sn, Pb and Cu can be removed from liquid iron by            treatment with CaC2-containing slags.  Surface tension is one of the            major factors which influence the lives and stability of slag foams             and the surface tension of metallurgical slags can be significantly             decreased by the presence of small concentrations of surface-active             solutes.  In this project an experimental study will be made of the             influence of oxygen pressure and the solutes                                    P2O5, Cr2O3, CaF2 and alkali oxides on CaO-SiO2 and FeO-based                   melts.  The results will provide a basis for understanding the                  phenomenon of slag foaming.",
