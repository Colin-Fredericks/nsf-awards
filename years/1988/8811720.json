 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies the effect of the simultaneous introduction                of an orthography for Somali and the establishment of Somali as                 the official national language of Somalia in 1972.  The order was               followed immediately by two years of mass literacy campaigns                    followed by establishment of newspapers and magazines, then                     pamphlets and government documents, followed by textbooks,                      historical works, and works of literature in Somali.  The project               studies how spoken Somali has changed during this period of rapid               and broad-scale popular movement into literacy and how written                  Somali differs from spoken Somali.  Large amounts of Somali text                will be computationally processed to pinpoint and quantify                      differences and changes during this highly dynamic period.                                                                                                      Few studies to date have analyzed speech and writing in a non-                  western language.  Moreover, although quite a few languages have                recently been the recipients of standardized orthographies, most                of them remain marginal within their countries, whereas Somali                  has been the national language of its country for the last                      sixteen years.  In view of recent works on the relationship of                  literacy and cognitive style, this project provides empirical                   data for testing such hypotheses.",
