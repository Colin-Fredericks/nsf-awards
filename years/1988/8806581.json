 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will determine how microbial biomass and                     production (bacteria, algae less than 5 um in diameter, and                     protozoa) respond to changes in the remainder of the limnetic                   food web brought about by planktivorous fish.  Experiments will                 be conducted in 18 large outdoor tanks to compare the effects of                three planktivorous fish (Dorosoma cepedianum, Tilapia aurea and                Menidia beryllina) on microbial and other components of the                     limnetic food web.  Because these fish have different                           selectivities on zooplankton and phytoplankton, we expect                       significant indirect responses of microbial biomass and                         production, and in the transfer of microbial production to other                food web components.  Experiments will be conducted in different                seasons to compare fish effects on plankton communities                         representative of different weather regimes.  During each tank                  experiment, grazing rates of protozoa on bacteria and algae, and                grazing rates of metazoan zooplankton on bacteria, algae, and                   protozoawill be determined by measuring ingestion of                            radioisotope-labelled bacteria and algae by protozoa and metazoan               plankton.  The grazing impact of planktivorous fish on protozoa                 will be measured in short-term feeding trials associated with                   each tank experiment.  These experiments provide an integrated                  experimental approach to the determination of the role of the                   microbial loop in planktonic food webs.",
