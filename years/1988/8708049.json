 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies carried out by the applicants and other                          investigators established that nerve growth factor (NGF) acts as                a neurotrophic factor for cholinergic neurons of the basal                      forebrain.  We found that NGF elevates choline acetyltransferase                (ChAT) activity and growth of cholinergic fibers in cultures of                 dissociated forebrain neurons.  We now propose to study the                     regulation of NGF receptor expression by cultured cholinergic                   neurons and the influence of NGF receptor protein and NGF                       receptor mRNA will be measured.  We furthermore plan to                         investigate whether the NGF-mediated increase in ChAT activity                  reflects elevated levels of ChAT protein and mRNA and whether                   thyroid hormones, which elevate ChAT activity of cultured                       cholinergic neurons in a similar way as NGF, act by affecting                   NGF-reflected mechanism.  In studies on adult rats, we earlier                  found that NGF prevents the retrograde degeneration of                          cholinergic septohippocampal neurons after axonal transection.                  It is now proposed to investigate the temporal requirements for                 cholinergic neurons, to study whether NGF treatment stimulates                  fiber growth from remaining cholinergic neurons into the partly                 denervated hippocampus, and to test whether NGF treatment is                    effective in lesioned, aged animals.  The studies will further                  elucidate the role of NGF in development and aging of forebrain                 cholinergic neurons and in their response to injury and might                   help to understand the decline of cholinergic functions in aging                and neurological diseases.",
