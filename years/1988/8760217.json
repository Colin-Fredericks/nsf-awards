 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded under the National Science                          Foundation's (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)                    program, which is designed to provide an opportunity for small                  business, particularly the small high technology firm, to                       participate in NSF research.  Phase I of the SBIR program serves                as a filter to select promising proposals and determine if the                  firm can do high quality research.  Phase II is the principal                   research project.  Phase III is the conversion of the NSF-funded                research into commercial applications and technological                         innovation supported by follow-on private venture capital or                    other non-federal financing.                                                         This is a Phase I project concerning applying expert systems               to network management, an extremely important area of research.                 Networks are growing very rapidly and are becoming too complex                  for non-automated solutions.  Enormous potential costs are                      attached to badly behaving systems, including delayed usage by                  commercial and government concerns.                                                  In Phase I, the principal investigator will select a                       suitable area of the problem for Phase II development.  The                     approach is to analyze this \"vertical slice\", expecting to obtain               insights into how to tackle the general problem while solving a                 particularly promising one.",
