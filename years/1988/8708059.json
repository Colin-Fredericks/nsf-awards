 "awd_abstract_narration": "The trend towards automation in manufacturing is expanding                 fast.  Machine interfaces, intelligent controls, CAD (computer aided            design) packages and computer aided process planning are increasing.            There is a greater demand for an automatic generation of assembly               sequence to match and link these growing areas.  Process planning               requires the expertise of experienced process engineers.  These                 engineers are gradually reaching retirement age and young engineers             who have not yet gained the experience are bombarded by the demands             of new technology.                                                                   The automatic generation of assembly sequence involves (a) the             extraction of constructive solid geometry and boundary                          representation, (b) determination of the type of each assembly step,            (c) the type of tools required, (d) the size of each tool and its               working envelope, and (e) check for collision, obstruction and                  clearance during assembly.  Once the assembly steps are determined,             a cost optimization approach can be used to generate possible                   assembly sequences.  The engineer can then determine, according to              his/her local assembly environment, an optimal assembly sequence.               Heuris algorithms will be generated for these decision processes.               The result is an expert support system which enables the fast                   transfer of 3-D CAD (computer aided design) parts and assembly data             into a set of possible assembly sequences to facilitate the process             engineer to speed up the implementation of automated assembly                   systems.",
