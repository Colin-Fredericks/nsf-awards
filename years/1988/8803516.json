 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the researcher, a cultural anthropologist from                  Arizona State University, will complete research analyzing land                 distribution, income patterns, living standards, social status                  and political participation in an upland Philippine farming                     community.  Data from this current study will be compared with                  information gathered in 1970-72.  Wider processes of                            developmental change in the region will be related to local                     changes over this period of time.  The project will clarify the                 developmental trajectories that Southeast Asian peasant                         communities travel under capitalist market conditions, with a                   particular focus upon conditions under which increasing social,                 economic and political differentiation is the outcome of                        development. This research will help us understand how such                     social differences sometimes create polarization between                        capitalist farmers and farm workers, and sometimes creates                      durable economically viable multi-strategy farm households.  It                 is a small part in our general understanding of the causes of                   conflict in the developing world.",
