 "awd_abstract_narration": "A modern telescope that incorporates many advanced technology              features will be acquired for use by undergraduate physics/astronomy            majors.  These students will use the telescope to learn research                techniques in observational astronomy, in addition to acquiring                 valuable original scientific data.  Students will make their own                observations, analyze the data, and prepare the results for                     publication.  In addition, they will learn first-hand the operation of          modern astronomical instrumentation.                                                                                                                                 The telescope will be installed at Appalachian State University's          Dark Sky Observatory, located in the mountains of western North                 Carolina.  The telescope will be equipped with a variety of auxillary           instruments, which exist presently or which will be acquired with               university funds.  These include a photometer to measure the brightness         of variable stars and a CCD video camera to acquire images of stars,            galaxies, quasars, and comets.  A spectrograph will be used to obtain           stellar spectra of sufficient quality to determine a star's spectral            type (temperature and size).                                                                                                                                         Observations and instrument control will be done remotely from a           warm-room, in much the same style as modern research observatories.             Students will also explore the possibility of remote control of the             observatory from campus, via telecommunications.  Thus, the newer and           larger telescope will not only replace the function of the obsolete             telescopes currently at the site, but it will also take a great step            forward into the next generation of telescope instrumentation.                                                                                                       The grantee institution is matching he NSF award with an equal sum         obtained from non-Federal sources.",
