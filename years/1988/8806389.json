 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Buikstra will obtain carbon isotope determinations on a                     sample of 120 human skeletal remains recovered from                             archaeological sites in the midwestern United States.  Because                  different kinds of plants have different carbon isotope                         signatures and these are reflected in skeletal composition, it is               possible through chemical analysis of bone to make dietary                      inferences.  For students of eastern North American prehistory,                 such analyses have provided new insight concerning the role of                  corn in late prehistoric peoples.  Although traditional wisdom                  links this resource closely with the development of major urban                 centers after A.D. 1,000, recent stable carbon studies have                     called this association into question.  It appears that corn may                have been significantly less important as a foodstuff during this               period than assumed.  It may also have been relatively less                     important at Cahokia - the largest known Mississippian regional                 center - than in contemporary frontier communities.                                                                                                             Dr. Buikstra will focus on Cahokia, which is located near St.                   Louis and was occupied between A.D. 1,000 and 1,400, and analyze                68 samples.  These will be compared with remains from later                     nearby cemeteries, as well as from sites located near the Central               Illinois River valley.                                                                                                                                          Archaeologists generally assume that a close relationship exists                between dependence on agriculture and the development of complex                societies.  This research is important because it re-evaluates                  this question and in so doing will provide insight into what                    leads to the development of complex societies such as our own.",
