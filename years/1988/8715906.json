 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation award will enable geography graduate            student Erik Swyngedouw to conduct field work in the European Economic          Community (EEC) in connection with his study of technological change            and innovation in the European telecommunications industry.  His                project will combine analyses of statistical data with interviews with          executives of EEC telecommunications firms.  The candidate's research           will focus especially on the role of the telecommunications industries          in \"filieres:\" flexible territorial production complexes that are               created in response to local and regional comparative advantages with           respect to the demands of the international economy.  Learning how and          why multinational firms (particularly telecommunications companies)             participate in and shape filieres will enlarge our basic understanding          of regional growth and development and the relationships of regional            production complexes to international economic structures.  The                 telecommunications industry is a case study that will be used to test           the validity of a new theoretical framework which ties interindustry            linkages among complementary firms to the regional and global                   strategies each of the participating firms uses to compete in the               international marketplace.",
