 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability of avirulent isolate of Xanthomonas campestris pv.                  vesicatoria to induce a hypersensitive reaction on near-                        isogenic resistant cultivars of Capsicum annuum or widely                       divergent species is controlled by the presence of specific                     avirulence genes.  In this proposal, we plan to characterize                    the race-specific avirulence genes, avrBs1 and avrBs2, and a                    member of unique class of non-host avirulence genes, avrZ.  The                 molecular characterization of these genes will provide a solid                  molecular foundation which will allow us to compare structural                  similarities or differences in protein products and regulation                  of avirulence gene expression.  The characterization of these                   genes and the production of polyclonal antisera to their                        respective proteins will put us into a position to design                       experiments to elucidate the biochemical processes involved in                  cellular recognition and the subsequent signal transduction                     processes responsible for eliciting plant defence mechanisms.                   The complementation analysis of the Hrp gene cluster and its                    possible functional relationship with specific avirulence genes                 will addressed by defining the genetic organization of this                     region of DNA and the effects of specific mutations on the                      regulation of avirulence gene expression.  Finally, we will                     investigate the molecular genetic control of host range                         exclusion in X. c. vesicatoria on non-host species and                          determine the inheritance patterns of plant host genes that                     determine resistance.                                                                                                                                           Many plant pathogens follow a \"gene-for-gene\" relationship with                 regard to whether or not they cause disease in a particular                     strain of host plant.  Disease ensues only when the pathogen                    carries a specific allele of one of its own genes, and when the                 host carries a specific allele of one of its own genes.  Any                    combination of other alleles of these particular pathogen and                   host genes precludes disease.  This genetic relationship has                    been understood for forty years, but the biochemical functions                  of the genes involved in the determination of the occurrence of                 disease have remained completely obscure.  Dr. Staskawicz has                   been one of the first investigators to succeed in isolating                     disease- determining genes from a plant pathogen.  In this                      project he will characterize the products of these genes, in                    order to lay the foundation for understanding of the molecular                  basis of the host-pathogen interaction.  Apart from its                         intrinsic biological interest, this work also has obvious                       practical importance for future efforts to control plant                        diseases.",
