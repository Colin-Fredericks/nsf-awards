 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bryozoa are colonial invertebrates with a rich fossil record            extending back 500 million years.  Their classification has                     traditionally been based on the morphology of adults within the                 colony and on the ways in which new individuals originate and                   grow within the colony.  Principal Investigator Reed has studied                the embryological development of several modern species of                      byrozoa, and has found evidence that disputes the accepted                      classification.  He proposes to investigate the embryology of                   species representing eight different families and two orders, and               compare the resulting classification with that based on                         traditional characters.                                                                 The proposed work would provide much-needed insight into the            higher-level evolutionary relationships among bryozoa, and would                provide a means of evaluating the current classification.  The                  proposed project would also serve as a model for bridging the gap               between invertebrate embryology and systematics.",
