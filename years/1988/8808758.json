 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational neuroscience is a subfield which is growing                  quickly at the present time.  Putting what we know about the                    functioning of the nervous system into quantitative terms is                    becoming more appealing now that computers are affordable, easy                 to work with and sufficient data has been gathered about the                    systems in question.  Mathematical models of various parts of the               nervous system are currently being pursued by physiologists well                trained in engineering methodology.  But now engineers have taken               an interest in modelling the various systems of the brain using                 their perspective.                                                                  This action is to provide partial support for an                            international conference which will bring together                              neurophysiologists and neuroengineers from various countries to                 discuss important issues regarding modelling approaches in                      neuroscience.",
