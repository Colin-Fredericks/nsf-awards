 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Seaborg Summer Science Academy is a two-week, residential intensive         program of instruction in science and mathematics for high school               students with demonstrated high ability or potential.  It is designed           to serve 40 participants who are entering the 11th or 12th grades, with         a few highly qualified 10th graders also possibly included.                                                                                                     The target audience consists primarily of students from isolated rural          areas in Michigan's vast Upper Peninsula.  The Upper Peninsula's Native         American community will be a particular target for recruitment.                                                                                                 The Academy participants will take a core course in Problem Solving in          Mathematics and Science.  In this course, they will develop and refine          skills in handling challenging problems while working together in               teams.  Students will also select two science elective courses and two          in mathematics.                                                                                                                                                 The Academy will be held July 17-30, 1988.  This will be the second             year for the Academy, and the sixth summer that the problem solving             course has been offered.",
