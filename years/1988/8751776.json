 "awd_abstract_narration": "School in The Exploratorium Leader Teacher Program is a two tiered              program consisting of a series of ten-day introductory workshops                designed to introduce 300 teachers to a basic approach to hands-on              science instruction and a two-year leader teacher internship program            designed to develop a cadre of 78 well-trained leadership teachers              working in the same districts who understand the principles of inquiry-         based learning and can support the activities of their colleagues. The          three year program is based physically and philosophically at the               Exploratorium, taking advantage of its exhibits and other facilities to         create a rich atmosphere for learning content and process. The program          will make it possible for 378 elementary teachers to have support in the        classroom by Exploratorium staff and artists and use a Lending Library          of materials as they learn an integrated science-and-art approach to the        investigations of nature and the everyday world.",
