 "awd_abstract_narration": "This expedited award for novel research is to investigate                       construction and design problems of concrete core slipforming with a            cross-disciplinary approach.  Slipforming is a method of rapidly                forming and placing concrete using hydraulic jacking units  to raise            a custom-made form.  It has revolutionized the construction of bridge           piers, silos, and building cores.  Major problems are: to keep the              form level; precise elevation measurements are required; thicker                walls pose a stripping problem; construction problems due to the                uneven rate of hardening of the concrete itself; precisely locating             many different shaped penetrations; and another major construction              problem is caused by the fact that the tolerances of the concrete               core and steel frame are not compatible.  The following ideas will be           explored:  a) the use of tapered fiberglass block-outs;   b)                    application of vertical and horizontal lasers will be investigated;             c) thermocouples embedded in the concrete of winter-constructed                 slipforms to constantly monitor concrete temperature for curing; d)             the effect of varying the forces exerted by each jacks and changing             the amount of steel rebar on the top deck to steer the core straight;           and e) new ideas for designing embed plates for out of placement of             horizontal and vertical directions will be tested.  This research is            expected to stimulate more creative and innovative construction                 researches by exploring new methodologies for automation of                     construction                                                                    processes.  The research activity is not merely a general                       academic study of core slipforming.  The Sundt Corp., which has                 built the IBM Tower Core, in Atlanta, GA  has expressed a strong                interest in this research, and has agreed to provide an                         opportunity to the investigator to study these problems during                  the next few months, and to explore innovative ideas in the field               to maintain the competitiveness of the U.S. slipforming                         construction in international and domestic markets.",
