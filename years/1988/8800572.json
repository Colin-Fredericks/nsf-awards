 "awd_abstract_narration": "High-value fine chemicals are frequently prepared in a more                     efficient and economical manner by the use of regioselective                    and/or stereoselective oxidoreductase enzymes in place of                       conventional catalysts.  However, such oxidoreductase enzymes                   consume expensive nicotinamide coenzymes--nicotinamide adenine                  dinucleotide (NAD) or its phosphorylated analog (NADP).                         Consequently, the practical use of nicotinamide coenzymes is                    limited to situations in which they can be regenerated in situ.                 Nicotinamide coenzymes exist in two forms:  the reduced form                    (NAD(P)H) and the oxidized form (NAD(P) ).  A major obstacle to                 the commercial use of oxidoreductase enzymes is the absence of a                large-scale, economical nicotinamide coenzyme-regeneration                      process.  During Phase I of the program, a novel process for the                efficient and continuous regeneration of nicotinamide coenzymes                 was developed.  The process, based on the chemical coupling of an               NAD-linked reaction with a highly specific membrane separation,                 allows an inexpensive sacrificial reducing agent or sacrificial                 oxidizing agent to quantitatively regenerate NAD(P)H and NAD(P) ,               respectively.  The goal of the Phase II program is to further                   characterize the membrane-assisted coenzyme recycling process                   with the aim of assembling a database of information appropriate                for process optimization and design of a scaled-up system.                      Specifically, the technical objectives are 1) to identify and                   measure the factors that govern the efficiency of the coenzyme                  recycling process, 2) to assemble a membrane-reactor system for                 the production of an amino acid utilizing the recycling process,                3) to evaluate the performance of this membrane-reactor system,                 and 4) to evaluate the economics of the amino acid production                   process.                                                                                                                                                        In this Phase II program, further exploration of the membrane-                  assisted process that offers a simple, economical method to                     recycle the expensive coenzymes needed for the production of                    extremely pure specialty chemicals will be carried out.  If these               specialty chemicals can be produced economically, they will have                a wide variety of potential uses, including the production of                   flavors, fragrances, food additives, pharmaceuticals, herbicides,               and pesticides.  As an example, it is estimated that the                        coenzyme-recycling process can produce L-phenylalanine, a                       component of the artificial sweetner aspartame at a cost savings                of 45 percent compared with current L-phenylalanine production                  costs.  Based on Phase I feasibility studies, it is expected that               similar cost savings will be incurred in the production of other                specialty chemicals.  Also, it is expected that variations of                   this coenzyme-recycling process can be used to provide an                       efficient method to regenerate expensive or unstable reagents                   needed in clinical and environmental analytical procedures and                  sensor technology.",
