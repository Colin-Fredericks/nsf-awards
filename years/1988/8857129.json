 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Peter B. Reich's research focuses on basic and applied                      plant ecophysiology.  His efforts have been devoted to                          quantifying plant physiological response to environmental                       factors and stress agents, with an ultimate goal of                             understanding evolutionary adaptations, natural ecological                      patterns, and applied environmental problems.                                                                                                                   His specific interests in natural systems lie in comparing                      evergreen and deciduous species in both temperate and tropical                  forests.  This is done by performing integrated studies that                    measure key factors on a variety of temporal and spatial                        hierarchical levels.  Current work is directed toward assessing                 net carbon gain of individual leaves and entire forest                          canopies over instantaneous (measured in seconds) and long-                     term (over seasons and years) time intervals.  The overall                      approach incorporates investigations of nutrient, water, and                    light utilization in the photosynthetic process.                                                                                                                With regard to air pollution ecophysiology, Dr. Reich's past                    efforts have yielded results that constitute crucial                            information which provided the basis for policy decisions                       affecting air pollution (including ozone and acid rain)                         regulation and control.  These results were the outcome of                      mathematical models capable of realistically predicting plant                   physiological responses to ambient gaseous levels in the                        atmosphere.                                                                                                                                                     Future work will also include study of the effects of various                   other biotic stresses (such as insect pests and disease) on                     plant and forest resources.  The Presidential Young                             Investigator award will permit Dr. Reich, at the University of                  Wisconsin-Madison, to expand his research horizons and continue                 along paths he has already established in his career.",
