 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientists have long been interested in understanding the neural                processes underlying perception.  In humans, these processes and                the sensory stimuli themselves are often so complicated that a                  complete understanding of the perceptual process is elusive.                    Much progress has been made, however, with simpler animal models                in which (1) the sensory stimulus in question is easily                         quantifiable and can be manipulated, (2) there is a way to tell                 if the animal can detect the stimulus, and (3) the response                     properties of the neurons responsible for the perception can be                 measured directly.  Electric fish provide such a model system.                                                                                                  Dr. Zakon's research involves a species of fish that continuously               produces a weak electric field from an organ in its tail.  This                 field (the electric organ discharge, or EOD) surrounds the fish's               body.  The animal is able to navigate and localize objects in                   dark, murky water by detecting distortions in the electric field                with specialized electroreceptors on the body surface.  The EOD                 is also used extensively in communication between fish.                                                                                                         The EOD voltage varies in a nearly sinusoidal fashion.  The EOD                 frequency of each individual is unique, and that of males and                   females differs by roughly an octave.  The electroreceptors are                 tuned to the fish's own EOD frequency and are much less sensitive               to other frequencies.  How, then, does the fish perceive the EODs               produced by members of the opposite sex?                                                                                                                        When two electric fish are close to each other, each fish's                     electroreceptors are stimulated by a signal that is the sum of                  the two EODs.  This interaction of EOD signals probably allows                  the fish to detect each other's EODs.  Using behavioral training                and neurophysiological recording techniques, Dr. Zakon is                       studying how these summed EOD signals are perceived and how                     information about the presence of another fish is extracted from                this signal.                                                                                                                                                    Dr. Zakon's research is elucidating the perception and analysis                 of a biologically relevant stimulus.  This understanding can be                 gained because electric fish often rely on electrical signals for               the detection of other members of the species and because                       electrical signals are easy to measure and manipulate.  The                     underlying processes of signal analysis elucidated should be                    useful in understanding perceptual systems in other vertebrates.",
