 "awd_abstract_narration": "WGBH Boston and its NOVA production group will produce a series of              eight one hour television programs titled \"Life: Cracking the Code\".            The series will cover recent advances in molecular biology, the                 record of personal quest and achievement of many of the biologists              who have contributed to these advances, the social costs and benefits           that have resulted and the ethical questions that new knowledge and             new abilities in biology have generated.  Individual programs will              include \"The Language of Life\" on the discovery of DNA's role in                molecular biology, \"Molecular Machines\" on proteins; \"Designing the             World to Order\" on practical consequences of the new biology, \"When             Cells Rebel\" on the processes involved in cancer, and \"Between Self             and Other\" on the immune function.                                                                                                                              The series will be produced for prime time PBS evening broadcast to             an audience of more than twelve million individuals by a co-                    production by the NOVA science unit at WGBH and the Chedd-Angier                Production Company.  Scientific advice and consulting will be                   provided by Harvard's Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and           a project advisory committee composed of seven distinguished scholars           chaired by Prof. David Baltimore.  The series production budget will            be  approximately $ 4.2 million.                                                                                                                                This new science series on DNA, molecular biology and its new                   technologies will cover one of the great intellectual achievements of           our time.  It will provide timely information about an area of                  scientific discovery that is rapidly transforming many aspects of our           life.  The series will, in addition, document the rich recent history           of molecular biology with the participation of many of the original             researchers who are still alive and active in their fields.",
