 "awd_abstract_narration": "The evolution of populations is characterized by a balance                 between factors acting to promote change and genetic constraints                imposed on such change.  In the present study, the evolution of                 morphological differences between the sexes (sexually dimorphic                 traits) within dioecious populations is being used as a model                   system to investigate this balance.  The evolution of sexually                  dimorphic traits involves genetic tradeoffs between male and                    female reproductive performance.  Such tradeoffs are the result                 of genetic correlations between the sexes, which in turn reflect                the extent to which corresponding traits in the two sexes, such                 as flower size, are controlled by similar genetic influences.  In               the previous funding period, males and females of the dioecious                 plant Silene alba were subjected to sex-specific selection for                  calyx diameter and flower number to evaluate both the genetic                   basis for these traits in the sex under selection and to assess                 correlated response in the other sex.  This work has generated                  populations in which males have become either more extremely                    male-like or more female-like, and a similar series of                          populations for female traits.  The primary objective of the                    proposed study is to take males (or females) from these different               lines, place them in a semi-natural environment, and evaluate                   their comparative reproductive performance.  Thus it will be                    possible to evaluate the consequences of modifying such traits in               either male or female plants, and by evaluating performance of                  their female or male relatives, respectively, to determine the                  genetic consequences of correlated response to selection in the                 sex not under direct selection.  This work will contribute to                   our overall understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of                       sexually dimorphic traits as well as the affects of genetic                     correlations between the sexes.",
