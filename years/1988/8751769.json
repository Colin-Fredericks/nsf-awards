 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science Collaborative Project is a three project for 60 underprepared           junior high school science teachers from  minority school districts in          New York City (Districts 4, 5, 6, 9, and 10).  These teachers will take         a specially designed sequence of four courses (summer session and               academic year) at CCNY in physics, chemistry, earth sciences, and life          sciences.  These courses are designed to both improve the teachers'             understanding of basic concepts in these four areas, and to extend their        pedagogical skills in teaching physical and life science material in            largely minority junior high schools.  In addition, a major aim of the          project is to improve the science skills and attitudes of minority              students.                                                                                                                                                       Approximately 45% of the science teachers in these five districts will          participate.  They will receive 18 graduate credits from CCNY for the           course work.  In addition, through collaboration with experienced junior        and senior high school science teachers at Bronx High School of Science,        participants will have the opportunity for extensive practice teaching          during summer sessions.  Participants are expected to attain a level of         competency that would permit many of them to help other science teachers        in their districts.",
