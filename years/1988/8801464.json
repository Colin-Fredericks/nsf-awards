 "awd_abstract_narration": "William Firey will carry out research into some of the                     classical problems of geometric convexity. His approach is very                 much in the modern vein and will involve extending results about                spherical functions to functions on more complicated manifolds.                 Many of these problems involve inequalities which have                          significance in geometric probability and stochastic geometry.                       Firey will investigate higher order support functions of                   convex bodies. These are natural extensions of support functions                to Grassmannian manifolds. He will study their relationship to                  various inequalities and investigate how their derivatives relate               to the curvature of the bodies. This work holds out the prospect                of contributing to the intermediate Christoffel-Minkowski problem               concerning preassigned intermediate curvature functions. It may                 also shed light on the extremal conditions in the Alexandrov-                   Fenchel inequalities.",
