 "awd_abstract_narration": "Separations based on phase equilibria (and thus thermodynamic                   properties of nonideal liquid mixtures) are often essential for design          of efficient chemical processes.  Costly and time consuming                     measurements cannot be made except for a tiny fraction of the enormous          number of mixtures of interest.  Group contribution methods such as             UNIFAC and ASOG show great promise for predicting phase equilibria of           nonideal liquid mixtures.  However, these methods are presently                 limited by the available experimental data to describe the group                interactions.  Previous work directed by Design Institute for Physical          Property Data (DIPPR), under AIChE, has made progress in measuring              data needed to obtain binary interaction parameters to fill in the              blanks in the UNIFAC tables.  Much additional work is needed to                 complete the tables and make the method more generally useful and               applicable.                                                                                                                                                     Vapor-liquid equilibrium and solubility data are measured for binary            liquid mixtures which is used to enhance the group contribution                 methods.  Specific systems are selected taking other work into account          to avoid duplication of effort.  Significant advantages are realized            in the handling of the project by DIPPR, since DIPPR broadly                    represents the chemical engineering profession and the chemical                 process industries, has a strong ongoing interest in the results of             the projects, selects researchers competitively, and administers                projects under contract with the researchers doing the work.",
