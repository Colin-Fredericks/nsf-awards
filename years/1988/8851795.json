 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes an interactive microcomputer laboratory                classroom in psycology.  It impacts all majors in psychology                    exposing students to the use of the microcomputer as an integral                part of the research enterprise in psychlogy.                                                                                                                        Student experiences include the use of microcomputers for                  programming of experimental contingencies, stimulus presentation,               data collection and statistical analysis with human and animal                  subjects.For those phenomena which cannot ber directly studied,                 simulation programs are used. Twelve microcomputers and ancillary               equipment serve a variety of courses and over 100 students per                  year.                                                                                                                                                                The laboratory is available for advanced student research                  projects as well. The provision of software for sharing                         information and documents should impress students with the many                 effective alternatives for developing research ideas, exchanging                experimental data and communicating the results of their research               investigations. This new facility represents a critcal and                      significant new direction in the psychology program. The award                  will be matched by an equal sum from the grantee.                                    ***\f     //",
