 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. G. Robert Brakenridge of Dartmouth College              to participate in a cooperative study of sedimentary geology with               Professor Wolfgang Schirmer of the Geographical Institute of the                University of Duesseldorf, Federal Republic of Germany (FRG).  Their            research plan makes use of field study sites within the U.S., a                 state-of-the-art laboratory facility in the FRG that is dedicated to            the study of fluvial sediments, and the combined skills and                     knowledge of these two researchers in fluvial stratigraphy and                  fluvial sedimentary processes.  Through preliminary joint field                 work, they have determined that the Holocene age sediments along the            Upper Connecticut River contain a detailed record of recent                     sedimentary history that brackets the critical pre-historic to                  historic transition.  During this period, the relatively pristine               fluvial system began to be greatly affected by human activities.                They now plan to 1) map and date Holocene terrace and floodplain                sediments in the Upper Connecticut River Valley, 2) characterize the            heavy metal concentrations within the fine-grained facies of these              sediments (through close-interval vertical profile sampling and wet             chemical analyses), and 3) estimate and compare volumes of historic             and prehistoric sediment in floodplain storage.  This will enable               them to estimate the long-term (decades to centuries) sediment and,             possibly, adsorbed pollutant mass budgets of this reach of the                  river.                                                                                                                                                          This effort to quantify long-term sedimentary dynamics has broad                significance because it will help to define the pathways and                    linkages that govern the erosion, transportation and storage of                 sediments in watersheds.  The results should provide insight into an            important component of fluvial sediment budgets, the floodplain                 storage component.  More specifically, the research is obviously                relevant to other studies of floodplain and terrace landforms at                locations further downstream along this major New England river, and            to research focused on deltaic and estuarine sedimentation at the               river's mouth.  It should also be of interest to a wider group of               investigators who are studying late Holocene and Historic fluvial               sediments in other regions of the world.",
