 "awd_abstract_narration": "High redshift quasars will be used to study the distribution and                state of matter at early epochs of the universe.  The radiation                 from quasars passes through the gas in intervening galaxies.  The               gas in the galaxies can be studied by studying the absorption                   lines of the quasar spectrum.  Observations at radio and optical                wavelengths and theoretical analysis and simulations will be made               to improve our understanding of the stages of galaxy evolution at               redshifts from 1.8 to 4.  The study will include both the detailed              investigation of particular objects that have been identified to                be of special interest and new survey work to answer statistical                questions as well as providing new objects for follow-up work.                                                                                                  The principle goal is completion of a study of a population of                  Quasi-Stellar Object (QSO) absorption systems that are                          characterized by heavily damped Lyman alpha hydrogen lines, they                appear to be the progenitors of galactic disks.  A search will be               made for radiation emitted by stars that are presumably                         responsible for the production of heavy elements.  The stars emit               ionizing radiation which is converted to Lyman alpha by the                     neutral hydrogen (HI) layer.  Thus, the ionizing flux is                        concentrated in the Lyman alpha line which subsequently escapes                 and may be detected in the spectrum.                                                                                                                            Surveys for dust in the damped systems, hydrodynamic simulations                of the collapse to \"HI disks\", and further radio investigations of              both nearby disk galaxies and redshifted 21 cm wavelength hydrogen              line absorption systems will be carried out.",
