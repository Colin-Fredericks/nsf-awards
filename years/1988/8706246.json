 "awd_abstract_narration": "The San Diego Museum of Man has long had outstanding anthropological            collections.  Two of their most important are the Oaxacan Indian                costumes and the Southwest Native American textile collection.  The             Oaxacan collection consists of 800 pieces collected from over 150               villages and the Southwest textile collection contains representations          of a wide variety of styles, weaves, and time periods of objects made           by Navajo, Rio Grande Pueblo, Hopi, and Rio Grande Spanish-Americans.           Both collections are well documented; they are irreplaceable, represen-         ting old traditions that are disappearing due to contact with Western           European and American cultures.                                                 The existing storage facilities for these textiles is limited and               detrimental to the textiles.  Cabinetry is dated and does not meet              contemporary standards of collections management retard the deteriora-          tion of the collections due overcrowding, pollution, fumes from                 untreated wooden shelving, dust, and fading due to light.  The new              equipment will insure the safety of the collection and allow resear-            chers greater access.",
