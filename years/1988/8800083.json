 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of community health surveys have found that social support             is associated with reduced rates of mortality and morbidity.                    Individuals with more ties to relatives, friends, neighbors, and                voluntary organizations live longer and healthier lives than those              with fewer ties.  Why social support protects people against illness            and premature death has not, however, been satisfactorily explained.            The theoretical perspective guiding this research is that the                   influence of social support in reducing mortality should                        systematically vary by cause of death.  The research will refine and            validate a new classification of cause of death, which will then be             used to test a series of hypotheses specify that the strength of                association between social support and mortality will depend on                 gender, socioeconomic status, availability of formal medical                    resources, as well as on the structural features of the social                  support itself.  Longitudinal surveys and mortality data from U.S.              and Swedish samples of elderly persons will be used to test the                 hypotheses.  The findings will contribute to our understanding of how           people's social environments are linked to their physical health.",
