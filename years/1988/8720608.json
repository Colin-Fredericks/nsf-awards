 "awd_abstract_narration": "Energetic particle studies can provide essential insights                  into many processes of importance to solar-terrestrial physics.                 For example, the elemental composition of solar energetic                       particles in large flares yields the composition of the solar                   corona, and is systematically different from the photospheric                   composition in a manner depending on the first ionization                       potential of the element.  This dependence is of key importance                 in understanding the transport of heavy ions from the                           photosphere to the corona.  As another example, particle                        energization by shock waves occurs at many sites in the solar                   system including the corona and the interplanetary medium,                      offering the opportunity to study particle acceleration in                      regions with different sizes and time scales.  As a final                       example, the transport of energetic particles from the sun to the               earth through the turbulent interplanetary medium, and the                      transport of shock accelerated particles give insights into the                 plasma properties of the solar wind plasma under widely differing               levels of turbulence.  This NSF grant will take advantage of the                existing computers and program libraries, and large data sets at                the University of Maryland to investigate a number of solar and                 interplanetary physics problems which in many cases can be best                 attacked using statistical surveys and/or multi-spacecraft                      observations.  The Maryland instrument on IMP, ISEE, and Voyager                used for this study is able to distinguish different ionic                      species in low energy particle populations, making it possible to               investigate unique aspects of energetic particle phenomena.                                                                                                          Specific studies to be undertaken include:                                                                                                                           1)  Solar particle acceleration and transport in small,                             impulsive solar flares will be investigated using                               a detailed particle transport.                                                                                                                              2)  Interplanetary shock acceleration processes will be                             studied using particle composition information to                               compare the shock accelerated particle population                               with candidate seed populations such as solar flare                             particles.                                                                                                                                                  3)  Upstream diffusion coefficients in interplanetary                               shocks will be derived from particle data using                                 gradient techniques.                                                                                                                                        4)  The radial evolution of shock accelerated particle                              populations between 1 and 4-5 AU will be                                        characterized.                                                                                                                                              5)  Acceleration processes in the interplanetary medium                             produce the Anomalous Cosmic Ray component and                                  accelerate ions in the turbulent regions near                                   comets will be probed.",
