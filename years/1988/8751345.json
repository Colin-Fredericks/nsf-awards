 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year project initiates a long-range plan of the Wisconsin            Academy Center for the Advancement of Science Education (CASE) to               develop leadership among Wisconsin's middle/junior high school science          teachers and to increase the quality and quantity of field experiences          provided students in grades 7-9.  The project's major components                include:  developing increased subject matter competence in field               ecology and field earth science; participant development of local field         experiences; and developing leadership skills and applying these skills         in local community and state-wide professional activities.  An active           support network will be established between participants and between            participants and scientists.  Sixty middle/junior high school earth             science and life science teachers will be selected over the three-year          project, representing 25% of Wisconsin middle/junior high schools.                                                                                              Subject matter will be provided through seminars, workshops, and field          experiences led by university, government, and industrial scientists.           Participants will have field experiences in the major geological and            vegetational provinces of Wisconsin as well as their local area.                Current environmental issues will be discussed.                                                                                                                 Leadership development will be addressed through discussions, readings,         and seminars.  Stress will be placed on strategies to implement change.         Through development of field-based curricular models participants will          be introduced to the process of curriculum development.  They will be           expected to provide leadership in their district as local schools               develop a science curriculum to meet the new state guidelines.                                                                                                  Participants will apply leadership skills and subject matter knowledge          during the project.  Each participant will be expected to:  conduct             local field experiences for their students as part of the curriculum;           provide an inservice field experience for elementary teachers and               principals; conduct a field experience for community adults; assist             their school in local curriculum development; and present a professional        paper at a local or state meeting.  In addition, each participant will          work with master teachers as those teachers work with students and/or           teachers in summer programs.",
