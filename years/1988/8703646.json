 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parasites frequently cause their host to show developmental and                 biochemical abnormalities which disturb the normal growth and                   reproduction of the organism.  Some effects appear to be mediated by            factors associated with the parasites such as bacteria or viruses, in           addition to the parasites themselves and the stress invoed by their             feeding and consumption of host nutrients.  Using the tobacco hornworm          and a braconid wasp parasite as a model system, Dr. Beckage has shown           that a virus injected by the parasite into the host stimulates                  biosynthesis of novel proteins found only in parasitgized larvae.  The          goal of this grant will be to characterize the proteins involved and            study their regulation to determine if the genes encoding for their             synthesis are components of the host, parasite, or viral genome (s) and         clarify the mode of their induction.  The tissues producing the                 proteins will be identified and the physiological role of the proteins          will be studied to gain fresh insights into the developmental dynamics          of how the physiology of the host is modulated to facilitate successful         parasitism.                                                                                                                                                     This parasitic wasp, Cotesia  congregata,  serves as\"a biological               control of several insect pests, and many closely related species are           similarly important in agricultural and forest ecosystems.  Thus the            information gained from this study may have important implications for          design of novel strategies to control a variety of insect pests in              addition to serving as a valuable parasitological model which will              enhance our understanding of the mechanisms involved in regulation of           host physiology at txe host-parasite interface.  Biotechnology could be         used to express normally parasitism-specific genes in the unparasitized         state, for example, causing developmental arrest prior to reproduction.",
