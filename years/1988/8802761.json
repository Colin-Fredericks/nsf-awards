 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program will study how the performance of some specific nonlinear          optical devices can become degraded through effects such as the                 development of instabilities, competition of the desired process with           undesired subsidiary nonlinear optical processes, and through the               influence of higher-order nonlinear optical interactions.  One aspect           of the work will involve experimental and theoretical studies of the            stability characteristics of two interacting laser beams.  Any                  instabilities that develop in such beams are particularly important in          that they could lead to a degradation in the performance of any                 optical device that involves intense laser fields.  This portion of             the work will include studies aimed at determining how the threshold            and nature of the instability depend on the geometry of the                     interaction and on the physical properties of the nonlinear optical             medium.  For definiteness, the remainder of the proposed work will              concentrate on limitations in the performance of one specific class of          nonlinear optical devices, that of phase-conjugate mirrors.  Phase              conjugate mirrors based both on degenerate four-wave mixing and on              stimulated Brillouin scattering will be studied.  Theoretical work              will include numerical modeling of the phase conjugate mirror with the          goal of optimizing its performance.  Experimental work will include             measurements aimed at quantifying the achievable device performance             and in characterizing any degradation in performance.",
