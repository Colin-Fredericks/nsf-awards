 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general support program of the Marine Board, National                       Research Council includes multi-disciplinary engineering studies                which will be useful in identifying ocean engineering research                  needs applicable to the NSF Engineering Program.  An assessment                 will be made of the state of knowledge of seafloor properties and               processes as related to the future utilization of the seabed                    within the EEZ.  Ten federal agencies are participating in this                 timely project.  Assessments are planned concerning the adequacy                of the engineering research and education base to achieve                       national ocean objectives.  Societal trends and deliberate                      national programs are rapidly altering our relationship to the                  marine environment.  Significant national goals include marine                  environmental protection, ocean and coastal space and resource                  utilization, and improved scientific understanding of the global                air-sea system.  Two initiatives in planning address the national               ocean engineering research and education competence and required                facilities and programs to achieve these and other national                     objectives.  Final reports on studies conducted in CY 88 will be                provided to NSF.",
