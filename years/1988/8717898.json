 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organization and structure of the bacterial genome is a broad                   subject, with many areas of microbial molecular biology applying                to several aspects of the subject.  Researchers from different                  areas of molecular biology or bacterial genetics who share an                   interest in the bacterial genome viewed as a whole have interests               that stem from quite different perspectives, and tend to travel                 in non-overlapping scientific orbits.  This proposal seeks                      support for a conference that would provide an opportunity for                  such scientists to get together and exchange information and                    ideas on the organization and function of the bacterial                         chromosome.  Subjects to be covered at the meeting would include                the organization of DNA in the cell, the structure of the                       nucleoid, the involvement of nucleoproteins, the effect of                      chromosomal structure on gene expression, the plasticity of the                 genome in terms of genetic change, the existence of constraints                 on such change, the control of global cellular functions, and a                 summary of the progress made in assembling genetic maps, physical               maps and nucleotide and amino acid sequences, together with a                   consideration of problems and solutions to achieving effective                  data management.  A meeting of this kind has not been held to                   date; it would seem to have high potential for generating fresh                 intellectul exchange among scientists whose paths seldom cross,                 as well as among those who are engaged in asking similar                        questions about structure and function of the bacterial                         chromosome.",
