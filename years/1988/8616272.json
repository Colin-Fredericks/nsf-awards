 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, is one of the most                      amenable and powerful experimental organisms available to                       biological scientists.  It has a short life cycle, it can be kept               easily in laboratories, it has polytene chromosomes which can be                used for cytological analysis, it has only four chromosomes and a               genome size only 20x larger than Escherichia coli, it can be                    transformed with foreign DNA and, most importantly, there is                    available an extensive data base of genetic information which has               been compiled over the years.  Drs. Dan Lindsley and E. H. Grell                organized this data base first in 1968 with the publication of                  \"Genetic Variations of Drosophila melanogaster\" or as commonly                  known \"The Red Book\".  The Red Book is a list of all known                      Drosophila mutants with their genetic phenotypes, map location                  and history.  It has been invaluable to the Drosophila community                of scientists.  However, particularly with the advent of the                    ability to transform the fly, the Red Book is sadly outdated.                   Dr. Lindsley has been working on a revised edition as well as                   computerizing the information.  He plans to take a sabbatical in                order to complete this work and has requested support for a year.               The importance of the completion of this revised edition to an                  entire community of scientists is difficult to over estimate.                   Support is enthusiastically recommended.",
