 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of the project is to enable the Council of Presidential           Awardees in Mathematics (CPAM) to conduct a series of workshops and             seminars for teachers of mathematics at two main sites in the country,          namely the University of Northern Iowa and the University of Northern           Arizona. Over a three year period 300 teachers of mathematics will              receive inservice educational experiences to update their knowledge of          mathematics and modern pedagogical practice. An honors seminar will be          held for fifty participants for two weeks each during June which there          will be lectures, discussion groups and planning sessions. The                  instructional staff consists of past Presidential Awardees cooperating          with faculty members at the University of Northern Iowa. Also, some past        Presidential Awardees will be participants in the seminars along with           other talented teachers of mathematics. Later, in each summer, the              leaders who have experienced the honors seminar will conduct two week           inservice sessions for other teachers at other universities. Three              workshops are planned: one will focus on issues of teaching and learning        mathematics at the middle school/junior high school levels, a second            will emphasize questions related to geometry, and a third is to focus on        discrete mathematics. Problem-solving, applications, the integration of         computers, and techniques of instructional methodology are aspects of           all the workshops. The follow-up activities include one-day sessions to         be held each semester as well as visitations by the workshop leaders at         the schools of the participants. there is a newsletter planned as well          as research components related to each of the planning groups. The non-         NSF cost sharing is approximately eleven percent of the funded amount.",
