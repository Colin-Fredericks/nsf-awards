 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of organic electrochemistry.  The                 broad thrust of this innovative experimental program includes the               synthesis and characterization of new macromolecules, molecular                 arrays, oligomers, and polymers.  These new materials hold                      exciting promise for potential use in molecular electronics                     devices, as new electrocatalytic surfaces, and as models for                    understanding membrane electrochemical processes.  The properties               of these new molecular systems that will be focussed upon                       include: (a) the single molecule electronic conductivity of                     \"molecular wires\" of polyacenequinones and thiophene oligomers;                 (b) the bulk electrical conductivity of appropriately reduced                   polyacenequinones and of molecular arrays and conducting                        polymers; (c) the electronic structures of polyacenequinones and                thiophene oligomers in solution and in organized arrays; (d) the                near-infrared and infrared electronic excitations of                            polyacenequinone anions; and (e) the mechanical properties of                   conducting polymer films used as electrodes in solution.                        Voltammertic, surface force microbalance, Langmuir-Blodgett, and                four-point probe techniques will be used to characterize electron               transfer and conductivity in these systems.  Electronic and                     magnetic resonance spectroscopies will be used as probes of                     molecular and electronic structure.  Professor Miller will                      collaborate with chemistry and chemical engineering colleagues at               the University of Minnesota, the University of Nebraska, and the                University of California at Riverside as needed to provide                      expertise for this broad, multidisciplinary activity that offers                exciting possibilities for the development of new materials with                tailored electronic, structural, and mechanical properties.",
