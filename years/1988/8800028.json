 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research is intended to continue previous studies of the               effects of AC and DC electric fields on surface related processes               in ionic solids.  The objective is to understand the effects of                 external electric fields on evaporation, via modification of the                gaseous species near the surface, the effects of electric fields                on impurity segregation on the surface and surface diffusion of                 various species, the interaction of electric fields with                        impurities, and finally the effects of electric fields on the                   nucleation and growth films.  Field effects on evaporation will                 be studied by standard electron microscopy techniques on various                alkali halide single crystals; coupled mass spectrometry will                   also be used to study the nature of the evaporating species.  X-                ray photoelectron spectroscopy will be used to study the role and               behavior of impurities and dopants on the surface with respect to               electric field effects.  Some parametric studies will also be                   conducted varying the parameters of the fields e.g., frequency of               AC fields.                                                                           This research is relevant to a variety of processes with                   technological import.  In particular, the eventual application of               the scientific understanding derived in this study to the growth                of thin films has a variety of important potential applications,                in the areas of electronics and optics.",
