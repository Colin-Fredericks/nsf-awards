 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this experimental research program the discovery and synthesis               of novel ternary silicides are integrated with a systematic study               of the low temperature properties of these materials.  The                      emphasis is on three distinct classes of ternary silicides                      (silicon plus two other elements).  Within each class of                        materials, they select compounds where two or more collective                   states compete for stability.  An extensive variety of                          experimental techniques are utilized to explore and clarify the                 properties of these low temperature states.  First they propose                 an in-depth study based on their recently discovered heavy                      fermion compound with silicon, platinum and cesium.  In addition,               they will examine four isostructural ternary silicides containing               cesium and nickel which show behavior typical of dense Kondo                    systems.  The experiments are designed to test the stability of                 the heavy fermion or Kondo lattice state against various                        perturbations such as atomic order, interatomic distances and                   tendency to magnetic order.  Our second project focuses on the                  critical interplay between the superconducting or magnetic state                and the charge-or-spin-density wave formation in silicon, cobalt                and scandium.  In a third set of compounds, they investigate the                importance of iron to superconductivity in lutetium-ion-silicon                 ternaries.  For all three projects, they emphasize experiments to               explore the relative stability of the various competing                         collective states.",
