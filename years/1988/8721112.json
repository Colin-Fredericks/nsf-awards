 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two new mass spectrometers will be purchased and in                        the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of                   California- Berkeley. They will be the primary analytical tools of              a new Center for Isotope Geochemistry that is being jointly                     supported by the Berkeley campus and the adjacent Lawrence                      Berkeley Laboratory. One of the machines is a single-collector                  model configured to maximize the possibility of obtaining isotope               ratio precision at the ppm level and will be used initially to                  measure strontium 87/86 isotope ratios in marine precipitates. The              other instrument will be configured as a multi-collector                        instrument to increase sample throughput so that certain types of               data-intensive research problems can be undertaken. The Berkeley                Center for Isotope Geochemistry is intended to be a science center              which will have as its goals the improvement of isotopic                        geochemical tools and the broadening of their application to earth              sciences. The Principal Investigator of this project has been                   appointed as the first director of the center.",
