 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of protein turnover in insects has the potential for                  development into a unique nonmammalian model system.  Initial                   studies will include development of methodology for measuring                   protein turnover in vivo in flight and intersegmental                           muscles.  The specific time course of turnover of these protein                 pools will be followed.  Little is known also about the                         regulation of the turnover of major larval hemolymph proteins or                the role of the amino acids derived from their breakdown.  This                 research will also consider role(s) and control of the turnover                 of these proteins in manduca sexta.  Several investigators have                 suggested that these proteins may function as storage proteins                  for supplying amino acids for the synthesis of new protein (e.g.,               in flight muscle and cuticle) during metamorphosis.  Studies will               focus on the fate of amino acids derived from the breakdown of                  these proteins by injecting radiolabeled arylphorin (manducin),                 produced in young larvae, into developing animals.  The fate of                 14C-amino acid provided directly to the hemolymph will be studied               for comparisons. Specific activities of amino acids will be                     measured in intracellular pools and tissue proteins.  These data                will show the potential interrelationship between amino acids of                storage proteins, hemolymph and tissue pools.  The potential role               of ecdysteroid in changes in turnover of these various protein                  pools (i.e., muscle, arylphorin) will be considered.  Future work               will consider the potential contribution of protease activities                 and inhibitors in controlling the turnover of proteins in the fat               body.",
