 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will test the feasibility of recruiting, training,                 an deploying a cadre of volunteers who are competent scientists                 and/or engineers and who will work in the schools as teacher                    aides.  Five sites, all locations of existing Triangle Coalition                collaboratives, will serve as the recruiting and training                       centers.  Science teachers from cooperating schools will specify                tasks for the volunteers and will assist in conducting the                      training workshops.                                                                                                                                             For one academic year, the volunteers will work in the schools.                 During that year, data will be collected on the effectiveness of                the service provided by the volunteers.  The goal is to recruit a               total of 25 volunteers (5 per site) who will contribute a total                 of 9000 hours of service (360 hours per volunteer).                                                                                                             The project will be conducted under the general supervision of                  John Fowler of the National Science Teachers Association.                       Significant assistance in the recruiting and training procedures                will be provided by the National School Volunteer Program.",
