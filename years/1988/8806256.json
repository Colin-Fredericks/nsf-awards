 "awd_abstract_narration": "Low pressure, nonequilibrium, electric discharge (plasma)                       processes are used in the microelectronics industry to deposit                  and etch thin films.  Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition                 (CVD) enables film deposition at low temperatures and can provide               new materials with special material and electronic properties.                  Plasma etching is presently used for etching of masking                         materials, silicon, silicon-containing materials, compound                      semiconductors, and metals.  In the production of a typical                     microchip, ten or more steps may involve plasma etching.  In this               industry, processing is rarely automated to a high degree.  Real-               time monitoring and control could aid in exploiting the fine                    geometry transfer available in plasma etching as well as increase               process yields by introducing dynamic treatment of process                      variables.                                                                                                                                                      The PIs plan a comprehensive study of mathematical models and                   process control strategies for plasma etching, reactive ion                     etching and CVD.  Plasma deposition and etch rates are affected                 by a large number of process variables including gas composition,               pressure, temperature, reactor geometry, electric discharge                     frequency, and power.  To model and develop control strategies                  for such systems both theoretical and experimental studies are                  planned.  A research etcher utilizing a radial flow configuration               with analytical systems and data acquisition has already been                   constructed and the PIs plan to construct laboratory-scale CVD                  apparatus.  Based on experimental results, physico-chemical                     models will be developed and verified followed by the formulation               and implementation of both dynamic and steady state control                     strategies.",
