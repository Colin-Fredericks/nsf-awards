 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three undergraduate students are to be supported by this supplementary          request.  Their resumes are included with this request.  The proposed           work involves three undergraduate research projects which are as                follows:                                                                                                                                                        1.   Experimental Study of Plasmid Loss                                              The undergraduate student will run continuous fermentations with                bacteria containing plasmids encoded to overproduce a protein.                  Samples will be taken and analyzed in order to correlate                        plasmid loss with cell growth and protein production rate.                      Results will be compared with a mathematical model.                                                                                                        2.   Modeling and Control of Invertase Overproduction                                The undergraduate student will perform shake flask                              experiments and scale-up experiments with a 10-15 liter                         fermentor in order to test and further develop a mathematical                   model of the secretion of overproduced invertase by yeast.                                                                                                 3.   Selective Recycle via Flocculation and Sedimentation                            The undergraduate student will run a continuous recycle                         bioreactor configured to maintain a slower growing flocculent                   strain in spite of competition from a faster-growing non-                       flocculent strain.  He or she will also perform coflocculation                  studies with mixed cultures and measure the degree of separation                of the two strains that can be achieved by sedimentation in a                   inclined settler.                                                                                                                                          Each of the three undergraduate students will be supervised by and              meet at least biweekly with one of the co-PIs on the NSF grant.  In             addition, a graduate student supported by the NSF grant will be                 assigned as a mentor to each undergraduate student in order to assist           the undergraduate with the day-to-day aspects of carrying out each              project.",
