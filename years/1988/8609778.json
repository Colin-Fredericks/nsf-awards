 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal of this project is to elucidate the role             of bacteria in the manganese cycle in nature.  The work immediate               objective focuses on the role of bacteria in reducing manganese.                In laboratory studies with pure cultures, the mechanisms by which               bacteria reduce manganese will be investigated.  Using these pure               cultures, and enrichments (mixed cultures) from a variety of                    environments, the PI will also develop methods for distinguishing               biological from (strictly) chemical reduction, and for charact-                 erizing the different types of biological Mn reduction.  Finally,               he will apply these methods to the study of Mn reduction in the                 field, both in fresh water (Oneida Lake, N.Y.) and marine (Black                Sea) environments.                                                                      Mechanistic studies will begin with strain SK13sp, a marine             Bacillus that is a potent reducer of manganese.  These studies                  will focus on isolation and identification of the extracellular                 Mn reductant produced by the cells.  Concomitant with these                     studies, Nealsen will be characterizing other pure cultures, and                beginning detailed analyses of other mechanisms.                                        Development of field methods will focus on identifying                  mechanisms of Mn reduction, using analogues, inhibitors, and                    poisons.  These methods will be tested in Oneida Lake, in Saanich               Inlet, B.C. by Dr. B. Tebo, and used for field work in the Black                Sea in 1987.",
