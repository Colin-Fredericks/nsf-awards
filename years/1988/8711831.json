 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the dissertation of Milka A.                                Skewes, a Chilean graduate student who is studying for                          her Ph.D. under James L. Munoz at the University of                             Colorado. They will study the fluid transport and                               deposition of metals in the early stages of development                         of the porphyry Cu deposits of Los Pelambres, Chile                             which are similar to those in Butte, Montana. Samples                           from Los Pelambres with hydrothermal deposition in                              veins will be collected and the mica minerals from the                          veins chemically analyzed for the halogens, F and Cl.                           The vein density at Los Pelambres is low and therefore                          there is little alteration by later events on the early                         veins. Halites reside in the mica in these veins and                            the study of the F/Cl ratio gives a record of the                               changes in halogen composition of the hydrothermal                              fluids during formation. The veins are associated with                          biotitic breccia which forms a link between the host                            rock and early magmatic fluids. Samples of this breccia                         available at the University allow a study of the                                transition from the magmatic to the hydrothermal stage                          in this deposit. The results of this research on a                              unique ore deposit which makes an important                                     contribution to the economy of Chile will significantly                         add to the understanding of mineral ore genesis. This                           research is particularly relevant to the SDC Program                            objective of supporting projects related to a                                   developing-country problem and in this case a similar                           one in the U.S.                                                                                                                                                 Munoz has developed the techniques of using biotitic                            mineral chemistry and has facilities for petrographic                           studies, fluid inclusion measurements and electron                              microprobe analysis. Work is underway on samples                                provided by W. Atkinson. The requested funds will be                            used for field studies, thin section preparation and                            microprobe analysis. The breccia zone will be mapped                            and sampled by Skewes over three-four weeks this winter                         and sample analysis carried out at Colorado. The                                results will be valuable to the copper industries in                            both Chile and the U.S. and there should be a                                   significant contribution to international science and                           the training of the Chilean student.",
