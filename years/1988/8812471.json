 "awd_abstract_narration": "When a person looks at a visual stimulus, all the information in                the scene is not taken in in one glance.  Rather, the person                    scans the visual scene in a series of \"snapshots\" (individual                   pauses or fixations of the eye), while sequentially collecting                  the information from which the brain constructs a unified                       experience of the world.  How this scanning takes place depends,                to some extent, on what the person already knows, and how                       sophisticated the person is cognitively.  But how does a baby,                  whose visual system is immature and who has neither extensive                   experience in the world nor highly developed mental abilities,                  scan the world?  Can the way in which babies look at visual                     stimuli be used as a way to understand their mental processes?                  This research will explore the relationship between visual                      scanning and information processing during infancy.  Babies will                be shown one pattern repeatedly, until their interest in this                   stimulus wanes (a process called \"habituation\").  Each baby's                   pattern of scanning eye movements and fixations during the                      habituation process will be recorded using specialized television               equipment.  The baby will then be shown a new pattern, different                from the first.  Usually, if the new pattern is distinctive                     enough, the baby's attention to the new stimulus increases again,               in a process termed \"dishabituation\".  This research will examine               the details of visual scanning during habituation and                           dishabituation to see whether differences in scanning across                    phases of the experiment reveal the expectations that the babies                have developed about what they are looking at.  The results of                  the research will contribute to our knowledge of how babies learn               about the world around them.",
