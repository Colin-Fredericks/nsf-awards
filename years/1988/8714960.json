 "awd_abstract_narration": "A current hypothesis in ecological physiology states that                  differences among animal species in the physiology of exercise                  arose in response to natural selection on the capacity to sustain               behavior.  Animals that typically undergo high levels of                        sustained behavior are expected to have high capacities for                     aerobic energy production, whereas animals with low aerobic                     capacities are expected to sustain only low intensity behaviors                 and must rely on anaerobic metabolism to fuel higher levels of                  activity, which are not sustainable.  For example, species                      differences in activity metabolism among anuran amphibians have                 been related to differences in locomotor, foraging, predator                    avoidance, and calling behavior.  Previous studies did not                      distinguish among adaptive hypotheses (i.e. recent selection on                 behavior and physiology) and alternative hypotheses for                         differences in physiology, such as differences in body size,                    correlation of physiology with some unexamined trait, or                        constraints imposed by phylogeny.  The proposed research will                   test for physiology-behavior correlations in a group of closely                 related species, the North American treefrogs.  The adaptive                    significance of variation in physiology will be assessed by                     determining the fraction of variation due to phylogeny and body                 size and the fraction attributable to variation in several                      variables that have demonstrated or adduced effects on survival                 and reproduction (e.g., locomotor performance and calling                       behavior).  Correlations that persist after removing the effects                of body size and phylogeny will be deemed to represent the                      results of recent selection.",
