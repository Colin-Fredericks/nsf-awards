 "awd_abstract_narration": "A pilot study of tropical soil organic matter will be conducted.                Field studies being conducted in Yurimaguas, Peru and in several                other tropical agricultural sites will provide data on soil                     organic matter dynamics.  Some of these data will then be used to               modify a soil organic model developed for temperate zone                        agroecosystems so that it can be used in the tropics.  The                      remainder of the data will be used to validate the modified                     model.                                                                                                                                                          The model is a cutting-edge synthesis of current thinking in soil               biology and chemistry.  Its application to tropical soils                       problems will provide much need integration of here-to-fore                     unsynthesized information on tropical soils and their responses                 to management.  With this synthesis tool we should be better able               to manage the often fragile soils of the tropics.                                                                                                               The investigators involved in the pilot study are world-                        recognized experts in their respective fields.  Dr. Sanchez has                 demonstrated, for almost two decades, his ability to work in                    remote field settings in Latin America.  Institutional support at               North Carolina State University and Colorado State University are               excellent.",
