The                project will consist of a series of instructional and experiential              activities conducted during a combination of two weeks on the WIU               campus during the summer, internships with practitioners in the                 field, and a one-day fall semester session in November 1988.  The major         objective of the project is to introduce 24 high-ability 8th grade              students from rural western Illinois to science and mathematics                 disciplines and careers.  The instructional components include                  hands-on laboratory work related to a research area in each discipline,         ethical and philosophical questions relevant to science research                and technology, and information relating to career opportunities                in science, technology, and mathematics.  Project staff will include            WIU faculty, with assistance from junior high school science teachers           and representatives from business and industry.",
