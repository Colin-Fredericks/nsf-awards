 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent data on the stratospheric \"ozone hole\" over the                     Antarctic suggests that a combination of dynamical and chemical                 processes are responsible for the dramatic ozone decreases which                takes place during the austral spring.  While the processes are                 complex and intertwined the recent field results obtained from                  the National Ozone Expeditions in 1986 and 1987 and the 1987                    Airborne Antarctic Ozone campaign does suggest that both                        meteorological and chemical factors contribute to the unique                    ozone distributions over Antarctica.  To date the campaigns                     designed to study this phenomenon have concentrated primarily on                investigating the chemical environment over the Antarctic                       continent and very little information is available about                        stratospheric dynamics.                                                              This experimental project is designed to make radiometer                   sonde soundings at Amundsen-Scott Stations, Antarctica to                       pressure levels of 20 millibars at six day intervals starting 1                 July 1988.  The radiometer sonde will measure the upward,                       downward, and net long wave radiation in the atmosphere as a                    function of pressure.  The long wave radiation differences                      between the pressure levels will be the long wave radiation                     divergence.  The long wave radiation divergence can be converted                to layer cooling rates.  The layer cooling rates will help in                   answering question about the dynamics of the winter times                       stratosphere over Antarctic.  The radiometer sonde will detect                  the presence of possible cirrus clouds in the stratosphere.  This               experiment is a preliminary study to see if the information                     collected is of use in understanding the causes and evolution of                the \"ozone hole\" over the Antarctic continent during the austral                spring.",
