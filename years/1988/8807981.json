 "awd_abstract_narration": "New evidence has been discovered recently that indicates the                    presence of archaic Homo sapiens sapiens in southern Africa                     during the Middle Paleolithic.  This is many years before the                   appearance of modern human beings in Europe and Asia.  There                    are also indications that these prehistoric peoples had a more                  developed foraging adaptation characterized by blade and burin                  stone tools than had previously been expected.                                                                                                                  During this project, the researcher will analyze the spatial                    organization of Middle Paleolithic hunters in the Zeekoe                        valley of South Africa.  She will analyze the changes                           in settlement pattern that occurred during the last                             Interglacial and establish a time scale and sequence of                         changes in stone tool design based on materials collected                       from the Driekoppen Rockshelter and a series of open air sites.                                                                                                 This project will enable the researcher to establish which                      tool types are the most diagnostic time-markers for this                        region and period.  The establishment of regional                               chronologies is becoming increasingly important                                 in paleoarchaeology.  Without good chronological controls,                      little can be said about the development of modern human                        culture.",
