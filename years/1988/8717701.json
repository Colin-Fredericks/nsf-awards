 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interactions between oxygen exchange, water influx,                             evapotranspiration and drainage in sediments of intermittently                  flooded wetlands which ultimately control much of the                           productivity and structure of these ecosystems are poorly                       understood.  These processes will be studied in: Several marsh                  zones (creekbank, low & high marsh) across the natural flooding-                frequency gradient in Great Sippewissett Salt Marsh, a well                     studied freshwater Phragmites marsh in Mass., a Virginia marsh,                 an infrequently flooded salt marsh and plots where the flooding                 and drainage regime (NJ) will be controlled:  These field                       experiments will be coupled with parallel laboratory experiments                in lysimeters and plant chambers.  By studying several flooding                 regimes in several wetland types, the results will allow                        determination of the generality of water turnover-gas exchange                  interactions as processes structuring many types of                             intermittently flooded wetland ecosystems.                                                                                                                      Gas exchange will be measured in relation to water table                        excursions in these systems through the annual, lunar, daily and                tidal cycles to which they are subject.  Fluxes will be measured                with both natural (O2, CO2, CH4) and tracer (Ne, C2F6,C2H6) gases               and partition gas exchange between plants and sediment surface                  fluxes.  The water loss due to evapotranspiration will be                       compared to drainage losses, and water replacement by flood                     water, rain and groundwater will be measured.  Direct                           measurements will be made of drainage, evapotranspiration and                   total water loss from creekbank sediments and determine the                     effects of plant biomass, sediment type and crab burrows upon                   drainage.  Relationships of interstitial salinity and sulfide                   concentration, evapotranspiration rates, salt exclusion and root                oxygen status in Spartina will be determined.  The solute losses                from the wetland sediments by transport within the plants and by                drainage and surface exchange will be measured.  Detailed                       investigation of the interaction between gas exchange-sediment                  physics using a multidisciplinary approach will be conducted in                 both a Mass. and Virginia marsh.  These experiments will also                   serve as an intercalibration of existing wetland hydrologic                     techniques.                                                                                                                                                     The research team for this project is well experienced and                      capable.  All field sites offer excellent opportunities for                     research.  Facilities available are more than sufficient to the                 task.",
