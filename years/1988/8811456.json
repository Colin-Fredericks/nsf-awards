 "awd_abstract_narration": "The technique of X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool for                   the determination of the molecular structure of compounds as                    diverse as small polypeptides and complex metal clusters.  When                 combined with the latest computer hardware and software, the                    technique is becoming remarkably easy to put into practice.                     The acquisition of X-ray crystallographic instrumentation                       markedly improves the ability of chemists to cary out frontier                  research.                                                                                                                                                       The Department of Chemistry at Washington University will use                   this award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program to                 help acquire a single crystal X-ray diffractometer and an                       associated computer system.  The areas of chemical research                     that will be enhanced by the acquisition include:                                                                                                               1)  Synthesis and reactivity of pentadienyl-metal-phosphine                         complexes                                                                   2)  Molecular routes to phosphorous-rich clusters and inorganic                     materials                                                                   3)  Analogs of triplet carbenes, polyadamantalized molecules,                       and metallasilacycles                                                       4)  Calixarenes as enzyme mimics                                                5)  Structure-activity relationships in bioorganic and bio-                         inorganic chemistry                                                         6)  Metal chelates as diagnostic imaging agents.",
