 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports continuation of theory for supernova spectra,               especially their changes with time.  The new information from                   supernova 1987A is expected to provide a strong stimulus for                    understanding other supernovae.                                                                                                                                 Supernova explosions terminate the lives of selected stars.  Among              the gases flung into space are newly created chemical elements                  which are later used in new stars and new planets.  Wheeler and                 his associates have studied the spectra of supernovae appearing in              rather distant galaxies.  Vastly more detailed data were obtained               for the relatively nearby supernova 1987A.  This award supports                 mainly the continued theoretical study of supernova spectra,                    expanded as needed to interpret the spectra of supernova 1987A.                 The differences between this and other recent supernovae will                   provide substantial clues to understanding the exploding stars and              how they come to generate the energies and elements that are                    observed.",
