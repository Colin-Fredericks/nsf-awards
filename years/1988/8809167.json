 "awd_abstract_narration": "A combined experimental and numerical research program is proposed to           study the thermo-mechanical treatment (TMT) of moving metal strips in           rolling processes.  TMT using controlled cooling has been adopted to            improve product quality and to reduce production cost.  However, very           little information is available on the heat transfer behavior of the            cooling process.  Therefore, this research is initiated to study the            thermal behavior of strip rolling.  Particular emphasis is placed on            the measurement of the local convective heat transfer coefficients for          jet boiling on moving strips.  Three cooling systems will be                    investigated and compared:  spray cooling, laminar jets, and water              curtains.   Surface thermocouples and thin film heat flux gages with            fast response times (on the order of microseconds) will be used to              measure the instantaneous surface temperatures and heat fluxes.                 Finite difference methods will be developed using Eulerian and                  Lagrangian approaches to analyze data and to predict strip                      temperatures in rolling conditions.  The effect of strip material,              strip temperature, and moving speed as well as the jet velocity and             jet configuration on the local heat transfer coefficients will be               investigated.                                                                                                                                                   Controlled cooling technology has recently been developed to                    perform on-line thermo-mechanical treatment (TMT) of the strips                 on the run out tables of hot-strip-mills.  The result is a                      continuous process for producing high quality products in the as-               rolled conditions.  At present, however, the cooling system                     design is primarily based on a trial-and-error approach because                 the heat transfer behavior is not well understood.  A better                    understanding of thermal and mechanical behavior of the strip                   cooling processes as described in the proposed research is                      needed.",
