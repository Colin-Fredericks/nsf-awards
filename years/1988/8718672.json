 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of mammals and                  birds is known to exert a major influence on both humoral and                   cellular immune responses.  In nearly all species adequately                    investigated, the MHC is characterized by a high degree of                      polymorphism.  In random breeding populations, most individuals                 would be heterozygous for MHC haplotypes and could thus benefit                 from the dominant expression of immune response genes in both of                the haplotypes present.  A homozygous individual, on the other                  hand, could benefit only from effects of the single haplotype.                  Thus, maximum immune response capabilities of a wild population                 would be favored by the continued segregation of a large number                 of diversified haplotypes.  The primary objective of the proposed               research is to determine the relative fitness of individuals                    homozygous versus those heterozygous for MHC haplotypes in                      species experiencing severe reduction in population size                        (endangerment).  Because of the impracticality of subjecting                    individual members of an endangered species to the rigors of a                  full immunogenetic analysis, a wild species with declining                      population size that is also available from game farms, the ring-               necked pheasant, has been selected as the primary experimental                  animal.  Present knowledge and expertise gained from previous                   work with the twelve known alloantigen systems of the chicken                   should permit identification of corresponding or similar systems,               including the MHC, in the pheasant and, to the extent possible in               truely endangered avian species of special interest such as                     various species of cranes.  The alloantisera produced in blood-                 typed chicken stocks will serve as serological probes in the                    identification of alloantigen systems in the other avian species.               As haplotypes are determined for the MHC, pedigreed family groups               of pheasants showing genetic segregation will be used in                        collaborative physiological, developmental, and disease exposure                studies to investigate the specific effects of particular                       haplotypes in homozygous and heterozygous individuals.                               Much progress has been made in understanding the cellular                  and structural basis for the immune functions of the MHC in the                 mouse and human.  Considerable evidence indicates that the MHC of               the chicken influences several fitness traits such as                           hatchability of fertile eggs, growth rate, and survival in                      juvenile and /or adult periods of the life cycle.  As yet,                      however, there is no clear understanding of the adaptive function               of the MHC in wild populations.  The ring-necked pheasant is a                  species living in the wild that can readily be used to                          investigate the role of the MHC in survival.  From the apparent                 universal presence of an MHC in all vertebrate species and the                  essential similarities in immune function across species so far                 investigated, it is highly likely that a knowledge of the                       essential function of the MHC in the adaptability of a wild                     species will be important in genetic planning for preservation of               endangered species.",
