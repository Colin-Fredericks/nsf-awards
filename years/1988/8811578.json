 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is concerned with the innovative growth of                new combinations of materials and creative methods for                          characterization and quality assessment of these new materials                  systems for use in ultra fast optoelectronic communication and                  switching systems.  Cadmium telluride (CaTe) layers will be grown               on gallium arsenide/silicon (GaAs/Si) substrates.  The use of                   GaAs/Si substrates offers the possibility of exploiting the fast                optoelectronic circuitry of BaAs and established silicon VLSI                   technology.  Combinations of GaAs and mercury CaTe will be                      investigated in the creation of a monolithic infrared detector                  system.  Photoluminescence (PL) which is a well known                           characterization technique will be combined with new ideas to                   characterize the film quality and to correlate defects with the                 film growth conditions.  The approach centers around spatially                  controlling the area where the luminescence emanates from the                   sample.  Photoluminescence is to be combined with                               electroluminescence and geometrical arrangements of pn                          junctions in order to confine and control carriers in areas of                  importance.  The combination of luminescene techniques provides                 the injection of excess  carrier from different parts of the                    sample and the pn junctions confine the carriers with built-in                  electric fields.  Some new approaches to the characterization of                thin layers from the combined used of photo and                                 electroluminescence in unique ways can be anticipated.",
