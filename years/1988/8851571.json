 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Biology Department is updating and modernizing its Cell                Biology course, particularly the laboratory component, as part of a             general shifting of emphasis in the departmental curriculum.  This is           being accomplished in part by obtaining instrumentation needed to               perform experiments in cell function and in DNA structure and function.         These areas are important to a modern course in cellular biology.                                                                                                    Previously the laboratory portion of the Cell Biology course was           organized in a classical manner, with a minimum of experimentation and          analysis.  With the acquisition of the new equipment, the course uses           the accumulation and interpretation of experimental results to illus-           trate concepts and material.  These instruments also are useful in the          Genetics and Biochemistry courses.  The equipment includes a refriger-          ated centrifuge, microcentrifuge, analytical balance, pH meter, and gel         electrophoresis apparatus.  With the new equipment, undergraduates              perform basic experiments on DNA.  These include the mapping of                 restriction fragments, and analyses of enzyme actions and kinetics.                                                                                                  The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
