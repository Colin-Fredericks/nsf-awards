 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Richter proposes to examine the regulation of maternal mRNA                 expression during the early development of Xenopus laevis.                      Oocytes of all animals contain a supply of mRNA which far exceeds               the cells' immediate protein synthesis requirements. This                       maternal mRNA is synthesized and stored during the protracted                   period of oogenesis and, in Xenopus, is translated during oocyte                maturation and early embryogenesis.  Dr. Richter has  obtained                  cDNA clones for mRNAs that are translated at only certain stages                of early development.  He has also determined that these mRNAs                  bind different proteins in oocytes.  He will first assess the                   nucleotide sequences of the mRNAs that are important for their                  translational regulation, and then will determine the proteins                  that are bound to those sequences.  These experiments will be                   performed by making deletion and chimeric mutants in SP6-derived                mRNAs.  These mutants will then be injected into various staged                 oocytes and their translational potential will be assessed by                   sucrose gradient centrifugation.  The proteins that bind various                regions of these mRNAs will be assessed by UV-induced                           crosslinking.                                                                   %%%                                                                             The early development of an organism is driven by the                           differential expression of various proteins.  These early                       processes are studied in the toad, Xenopus laevis because the                   eggs are large and easy to work with.  In this organism the very                early embryonic development is programmed not by the activation                 of specific genes, but rather by differential expression of                     messenger RNAs stored within the egg prior to fertilization. Dr.                Richter will investigate how the expression of various proteins                 is regulated in early embryogenesis.",
