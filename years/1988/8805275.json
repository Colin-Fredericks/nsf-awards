 "awd_abstract_narration": "To gain insight into how great apes communicate, Dr. Mitani will                collect field data on all four great ape species - the orangutan,               gorilla, chimpanzee, and bonobo (pygmy chimpanzee) - and                        supplement these materials with recordings already in his                       possession.  Research will be conducted at the Gunung Palung                    Nature Reserve, West Kalimantan, Indonesia (orangutan), Mahale                  Mountains Research Station, Tanzania (chimpanzee), Karisoke                     Research Center, Rwanda (gorilla) and the Lomako Forest, Zaire                  (bonobo).  At each site, animals will be followed and high                      quality tape recordings of vocalizations will be made.  The                     context in which the calls are uttered will also be noted.                      Playback experiments will be conducted in which a tape recorded                 call will be played from a location hidden to the subject animal,               and the animal's reaction will be recorded.                                                                                                                     The research addresses four specific questions.  In what ways do                great ape \"loud calls\" differ among species?  Do the loud calls                 of apes vary in acoustic structure over the geographical range of               a single species?  Are there individual differences in the                      acoustic structure of loud calls?  Is there acoustic variability                within the calls of given individuals, and is this variability                  related to differences in their contexts of emission?                                                                                                           All great ape species are endangered and their preservation is a                high conservation priority.  To do this effectively, it is                      necessary to understand as much as possible about their behavior,               and this research will make a major step in that direction.                     While it is clear that these species communicate vocally, this                  process has been studied very little.  The work is also important               because it will set human language in a broader biological                      context and possibly provide some insight into how this uniquely                human trait developed.",
