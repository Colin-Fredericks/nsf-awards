 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference will bring together an international group                      experts on various aspects of RNA function.  Some of these                      aspects are newly emerging areas of intensive research, and                     one of them has never before been the subject of a formally                     convened session.  The series of conferences to which this                      one belongs are noted for their promotion of lively exchange                    of ideas, as well as the unusual opportunity they have                          provided for younger scientists (students and postdoctoral                      fellows) to participate in face-to-face discussions with                        acknowledged leaders in the field.  The discussions at this                     conference will permit exchange of ideas among experts who                      would not normally interact, and should thus provide a great                    impetus for research in this exciting field.",
