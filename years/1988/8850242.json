 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Kentucky College of Engineering will conduct a two-           week residential summer program for twenty high school seniors to               introduce them to the engineering profession and to encourage them to           pursue careers in engineering fields.  Participants will be selected            from Kentucky residents on the basis of an application to include a             high school transcript, an essay, and one letter of recommendation.             Young women, minority, and handicapped students are especially                  encouraged to apply.                                                                                                                                            The program will consist of discussion sessions, laboratory                     experiences, field trips, and lectures to thoroughly acquaint the               students with several different engineering disciplines, career                 opportunities, required educational preparation, and ethical practices          of the engineering profession.  Interdisciplinary programs in                   biomedical engineering and pharmaceutical engineering will also be              introduced to the participants.  Staffing will include faculty, staff,          graduate students, and undergraduate students from the College of               Engineering.                                                                                                                                                    Follow-up activities will include returning to campus for seminar               presentations of student projects in late February, 1989; community             recognition for program participation; and continuous communication             between the students and the University.",
