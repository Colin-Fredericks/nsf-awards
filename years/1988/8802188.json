 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research on a survey                            of the redshift of galaxies in the southern sky by Dr.                          David Latham of the Smithsonian Observatory (SAO) and                           L. A. N. da Costa of the National Observatory of                                Brazil. A survey will be made of a strip of sky in the                          south to determine whether a good sample of the                                 universe has been achieved in previous work and to                              measure average properties of large-scale structures                            and flows. Unexpectedly large structures in the                                 universe have been discovered previously. Mapping out                           galaxy distributions is the first step toward                                   understanding the origin and evolution of these                                 structures.                                                                                                                                                     The collaboration will allow observation of galaxies                            in the southern skies that cannot be observed from                              this country, an obvious advantage to the U.S.                                  astronomers. The Smithsonian Observatory will maintain                          the detector system using expertise and materials not                           available in Brazil. Excess computer equipment will be                          shipped to Brazil to help with this work. The                                   Brazilian astronomers will carry out the                                        interpretation of the data during visits to SAO. There                          is an excellent working relationship between these                              groups which will be continued by this project.",
