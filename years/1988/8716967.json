 "awd_abstract_narration": "A primary mechanism through which plants prevent colonization                   by potentially pathogenic microorganisms is the                                 hypersensitive response (HR), a rapid, local necrosis                           accompanied by the production of antimicrobial compounds.                       Previous genetic studies with Pseudomonas syringae pathovars                    (host range variants of P.syringae) suggest that elicitation                    of the HR by incompatible bacterial pathogens is controlled                     by two types of genes: hrp (necessary for any plant reaction)                   and avr (affecting host range).  The nature of the                              elicitor(s) remains unknown.  The interaction of P.syringae                     with tobacco suspension culture cells provides an ideal                         system to investigate the elicitation of the HR by bacteria.                                                                                                    Cultured tobacco cells rapidly respond to incompatible                          bacteria by a K+ efflux/H+ influx exchange response (XR) that                   is physiologically, genetically and developmentally similar                     to the in planta HR.  In studies thus far this lab has: 1)                      cloned an apparent set of hrp/avr genes from P.syringae pv.                     syringae (Pss61) that are phenotypically expressed in the                       saprophytes, Escherichia coli and P. fluorescens, thus                          simplifying subsequent genetic analyses; 2) observed that                       Pss61 containing the cloned wild-type hrp/avr genes produce a                                                                                                   stronger XR than wild-type Pss61, suggesting that elicitor                                                                                                      production can be enhanced by genetic manipulation; and 3)                                                                                                      identified in vitro conditions for preinducing the bacterial                                                                                                    elicitor of the XR.  These findings provide powerful new                                                                                                        tools to investigate the bacterial signals governing host                                                                                                       range and pathogenicity.  The goal of this investigation is                                                                                                     to isolate and characterize biochemically the bacterial                                                                                                         elicitors involved in the induction of plant responses.  The                                                                                                    proposed experiments will define the genetic units present in                                                                                                   the hrp/avr clone and use reporter gene fusions to elucidate                                                                                                    the regulation of functional loci and characterize the                                                                                                          protein products.***//",
