This is the first international conference to be held in the                    Peoples Republic of China (PRC) solely on thermodynamics, phase                 equilibrium, and separations.  The benefits to the United States                participants and the general United States technical community                  may be:  (1) establishment of joint, cooperative research                       programs; (2) extended research visits by senior scholars from                  PRC at little or no cost to the United States laboratories in                   which they work; (3) an exchange of ideas and theories resulting                in a cross fertilization of the research programs in both                       countries.                                                                                                                                                      A maximum allocation of $1,350 per person will be made for                      airline tickets only.  Each recipient will provide a two-page                   travel report to be included in a final report.  No sub-award                   will be made by Purdue University to any individual with a                      delinquent NSF grant final report.",
