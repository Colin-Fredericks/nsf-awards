 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rock masses are the host media for engineering ventures of major                economic and defense significance.  The performance of a rock mass              under engineering conditions is usually dominated by the                        discontinuous nature of the medium.  However, the techniques of                 describing the topography of discontinuities or joints, which                   strongly influence their properties, and of experimentally measuring            their mechanical properties, are still rather elementary.  The                  research identifies an approach for determining joint stiffness and             strength properties under a testing condition of controlled normal              stiffness, which is completely analogous to the state of loading                which a joint experiences in situ.  A stiffness-controlled system is            proposed for joint testing which can yield joint stiffness and                  strength properties in one-directional direct shear and after load              reversal.  The ultimate purpose of research is to relate joint                  mechanical properties to rock material properties and joint                     topography.  The fractual dimension of the joint surface is suggested           as a parameter which may avoid current problems in describing the               rough state of a joint surface.",
