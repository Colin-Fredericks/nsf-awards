 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Sillen will chair a two week conference which will bring                    together approximately 20 experts in physical anthropology and                  allied fields to discuss the application of chemical techniques                 to the reconstruction of prehistoric human diet.  In particular                 the group will focus on the analysis of human skeletal remains.                 Past research has shown that different foodstuffs vary in their                 isotopic composition of carbon and nitrogen as well as such trace               minerals as strontium.  These differences are often reflected in                the bone composition of their consumers and through analysis of                 skeletal remains it is possible to gain some insight into diet.                 However the suite of techniques used to accomplish this are still               under development and this conference will examine specific                     problems and suggest ways around them.  In particular the                       participants will focus on variation in the foods themselves,                   methods of analysis, the problem of diagenesis (change in bone                  composition over time) and the analysis of specific                             archaeological sites.  The research is important because it will                increase our understanding of our own past and help to establish                a baseline against which modern human diets can be measured.",
