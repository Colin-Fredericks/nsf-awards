 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this workshop is (1) to provide guidance to the National         Science Foundation on appropriate uses of the MOSIS integrated circuit          fabrication service by undergraduate students nationwide; (2) to                identify design and test software, curriculum plans and texts and other         support functions needed to implement an efficient undergraduate                education program in VLSI design; and (3) identify rules, guidelines,           and fiscal policies for requesting, executing, and maintaining a                continuing undergraduate VLSI education program which is tightly                coupled to the needs of industry and government.  The workshop will be          attended by key, motivated educators, industrial supporters, and                government officials with oversight and general guidance provided by a          select steering committee.                                                      VLSI design has become an important component of electrical and                 computer engineering, both in practice and research.  The MOSIS                 fabrication service, supported by NSF and DARPA, has demonstrated high          value in VLSI teaching and research.  It is the major national resource         by which students can get their designs implemented so that they can            directly observe through test procedures the success and shortcomings           of their efforts.  The MOSIS service has been used primarily by                 graduate students.  Because of the broad need for VLSI design skills,           it is important that more undergraduate exposure to VLSI design take            place.  Toward this end, the proposed workshop will plan and delineate          steps to increase undergraduate course usage of MOSIS fabrication and           to encourage the introduction of VLSI design courses in primarily               undergraduate institutions.  The workshop will also compile pertinent           resources that are available for VLSI design courses and plan the               transfer of experience to faculty that has no previous experience with          VLSI foundry service.",
