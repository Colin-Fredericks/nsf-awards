 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves design, fabrication, and characterization of             novel systems of asymmetric membranes for gas separations.  These               inert and reactive membranes will be created by the ordered deposition          of polymeric monolayers via the Langmuir/Blodgett (l/B) technique onto          porous membranes.  Reversible reactive carriers will be incorporated            into the ultrathin L/B films to increase the transport of specific              species.  Ultrathin reactive asymmetric membranes do not presently              exist.  The completed films will be structurally characterized by               infrared and far infrared spectroscopy.  Mass transport studies will            be performed to determine the species selectivity; permeation                   properties will be correlated with the spectroscopic structural                 studies to elucidate the transport mechanism in both inert and                  reactive membranes.                                                                                                                                             Two well characterized polymers will be used for the L/B films:                 polyacrylates and polymethacrylates.  The asymmetric porous membranes           are Gore-Tex and Celgard.  Amines are incorporated into the deposited           L/B films for reactive (or facilitated) transport of acid gases                 hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide).  Gases to be studied for                  diffusivities are helium, oxygen, nitrogen, methane, sulfur                     hexafluoride, hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide.  The design,                 fabrication, and structural and transport characterization of                   asymmetric membranes produced using ultrathin ordered polymeric films           will have a significant impact on gas separation.  The opportunity              exists to create membranes with high transport properties for specific          gas species while excluding transport of others.  In particular, the            separation of acid gases from product gases is an important industrial          application.  The research described in this proposal is a foundation           toward the development of molecular engineering approaches to the               design and fabrication of highly specific asymmetric membranes.",
