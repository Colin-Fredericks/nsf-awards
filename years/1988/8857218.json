 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is directed at various topics in theoretical                  high energy astrophysics, dealing primarily with phenomena in                   the vicinity of astronomical compact objects such as neutron                    stars, white dwarfs, and active galactic nuclei.  It includes                   models of cosmic gamma-ray burst sources toward understanding                   the origin of the optical flashes that are occasionally                         detected from these systems; models of the class of cosmic X-                   ray burst sources whose spectra may be used to infer the                        properties of accretion disks in these systems; studying the                    evolution of compact binary stars, such as magnetic cataclysmic                 variables, in which the coupling of the white dwarf's magnetic                  field to the companion star affects the binary's evolutionary                   history; and studying the nuclei of active galaxies.                                                                                                            This work should increase our understanding of the basic                        physical processes that govern the dynamics of the exotic                       astrophysical objects cited.  While no specific applicability                   to terrestrial systems is anticipated, some of these processes                  are of interest in other areas as well.",
