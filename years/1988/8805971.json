 "awd_abstract_narration": "Is evolution dictated primarily by genetic factors or primarily                 by environmental factors?  Increasing emphasis in recent years                  has been placed on extrinsic factors as significantly affecting                 evolutionary events and pathways.  Another major interest area is               the origin and maintenance of helping behavior as opposed to                    selfish behavior.  A strict Darwinian interpretation of natural                 selection would be that helping behavior should be rare outside                 of parent.offspring and mate interactions, yet social behavior is               widespread in mammals and is particularly prominent in humans,                  and it also occurs in some birds and insects.                                           Social insects represent a valuable model system with which             to test and evaluate certain hypotheses that are central to these               issues in contemporary biology.  Social insects can be                          manipulated experimentally to address questions with an ease and                economy unapproached in social birds, mammals, or humans.                               The proposed research utilizes primitively social wasps                 (\"paper wasps\"), reared in the laboratory according to strict                   experimental protocols, to attempt to resolve the developmental                 basis of worker (helping) behavior in them.  The work will at the               same time address the relative contribution of environmental                    factors (nourishment, in particular) versus hypothesized                        intrinsic, genetic factors in the evolution of worker behavior.                 Most recent research in the field has emphasized genetic factors,               whereas the present study will emphasize extrinsic factors.                     Results of the research will thus bear directly on two areas of                 central interest in biology today.                                                      In addition to addressing basic hypotheses in biology, the              specific knowledge gained about wasp nourishment and development                may be applicable to the managed rearing of paper wasps, which                  have high potential as biological control agents where                          caterpillars (e.g., Cotton bollworm, Tomato budworm, Cabbage                    looper, etc.) are plant pests, and chemical control of the                      caterpillars is either unfeasible or undesirable.",
