 "awd_abstract_narration": "Embryos of the glossiphoniid leech Helobdella triserialis are well          suited for studying cellular events in early development, because they          are large, hardy, and contain identifiable cells that are accessible for        many sorts of experimental manipulations.  These embryos exhibit many           phenomena that are of general significance in the development of higher         eukaryotes, including cytoplasmic determinants, directed movements of           nuclei and mitotic spindles, distinct phases of cleavage and stem cell          divisions, epiboly, separable instances of lineage dependent and                position dependent fate determination, and epithelial interactions.  The        research proposed here would employ a variety of techniques, such as:           the microinjectin of cell lineage tracers, photosensitizing dyes, drugs         and radiochemicals; in situ hybridization; immunohistochemistry; gel            electrophoresis; autoradiography; time lapse video recording; and low           light fluorescence microscopy.  From these studies, a more detailed             description of various developmental processes and the mechanisms by            which they operate should be generated.  In addition, by examining a            number of developmental processes in parallel in the same species, it is        hoped that some understanding of the higher order mechanisms by which           the basic cellular and developmental processes interact will emerge.            For example, one part of this project would study the formation of              specialized cytoplasmic domains prior to first cleavage and how they            might influence the symmetry of the first cleavage.  Another part would         test the hypothesis that inherited RNAs regulate a change in cell               division pattern.                                                                   The question of how individual cells acquire their specific fates           during early embryological development is a basic problem of                    developmental biology.  Dr. Weisblat, using the leech as a model system,        proposes a series of experiments to define what influences cell lineages        of the embryo.",
