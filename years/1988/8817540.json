 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Arctic Division of the American Association for the Advancement of          Science holds an annual conference either in Alaska or western Canada.          The 1988 Conference will be held in Fairbanks, Alaska, October 7-10,            1988.  The theme of the Conference is Science Education and is being            organized by the University of Alaska in conjunction with the                   Fairbanks North Star Borough School District.  This project seeks               funding to provide travel assistance to secondary school educators              from the far-reaches of the State of Alaska.  The Conference is being           held in Fairbanks to coincide with the local teacher-in-service                 training periods.  Several hundred secondary school educators are               expected to attend and be joined by several hundred scientists from             Alaska and Canada and speakers from non-Alaskan institutions and                organizations.  Workshops, special sessions and keynote speakers will           cover a wide range of science education needs and solutions unique to           remote northern regions, including content, concepts, delivery                  techniques and training.  Scientists and educators at all levels will           have the opportunity to discuss approaches, and successes and failures          in motivating rural and native students for science and engineering             careers.",
