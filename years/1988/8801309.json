 "awd_abstract_narration": "This mathematical research project will undertake spectral                  and variational analysis of several topics originating in                       theoretical physics.  It is both pure and applied mathematics:                  applied in the sense that one of the goals is the derivation of                 formulae that a physicist can actually use, and pure in that it                 consists of proving rigorous theorems.                                               Quantities of physical importance are frequently minimizers                of certain functionals or eigenvalues and eigenvectors of linear                operators.  In this research most of them originate in quantum                  physics, such as Schroedinger operators for individual particles                or bulk matter, or the Skyrme model for baryons.  The principal                 investigators will continue their work on these and other                       subjects by combining abstract techniques, primarily from                       functional analysis, with more particular tools, e.g. from the                  theory of differential equations or perturbation techniques.                    Intuition from physics and from numerical calculations is also                  expected to help.",
