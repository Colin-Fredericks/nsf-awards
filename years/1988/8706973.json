 "awd_abstract_narration": "Strictness analysis deals with the question: given divergent term          M, when is term NM divergent?  It has been shown that, in a higher-             order functional language, strictness properties of terms can be viewed         as a collection of \"strictness types\" possessed by terms.  This project         explores the contention that strictness analysis may profitably be              considered a form of type inference.                                                                                                                                 The primary research goal is to investigate aspects of strictness          in a higher-order functional language, including the following: (a)             type-theoretic characterization of strictness, (b) completeness of              inference rules for strictness analysis (c) inherent complexity of              strictness analysis, (d) efficient algorithms that combine type                 checking and strictness analysis, (e) polymorphic invariance and                strictness analysis.                                                                                                                                                 These are two secondary research goals: (i) development of                 programming tools for the analysis, and, direct execution, of inference         rules, (ii) investigation of other program analysis problems, including         those of structure strictness analysis and permutativity analysis.",
