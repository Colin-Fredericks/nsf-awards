 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year cooperative research project in              organic chemistry between Professor Richard W. Franck, Department of            Chemistry, Hunter College of the City University of New York, and               Professor Joachim Thiem, Organic Chemistry Institute, University of             Muenster, Federal Republic of Germany.  The objective of the research           is to complete a synthesis of Olivomycin A, an antibiotic composed of a         so-called aglycone central unit linked to two different sugar                   side-chains.  Professor Franck and his students have developed an               efficient and stereoselective synthesis of the aglycone.  Professor             Thiem and his group have prepared the two sugar side-chains.  The               completion of the synthesis requires the improvement of known                   methodology or the development of a new method to link the sugars to            the aglycone, and that is the goal of this cooperation.  Professors             Franck and Thiem have complementary expertise in synthetic organic              chemistry.  By combining their respective strengths, they expect to             make much more rapid progress toward their common objective than would          otherwise be possible.                                                                                                                                          Synthesis of Olivomycin A would be a significant achievement in natural         product chemistry.  The methods developed here for joining sensitive            and complex saccharides and aglycones could also be applicable to the           synthesis of other members of this family of antibiotics and related            compounds, and could contribute to a better understanding of their              mechanism of action.",
