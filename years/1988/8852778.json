 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will upgrade and expand instruction in color science               in nine associate and baccalaureate degree programs at the                      Fashion Institute of Technology (F.I.T.).  F.I.T. is a                          specialized community college of the State University of New                    York.  The understanding of color in scientific terms is an                     essential part of the professional education of a growing number                of full and part-time students at F.I.T. who prepare for careers                in fashion and its related industries and professions.  Beyond                  the need for professionally relevant education, the college is                  committed to the importance of providing hands-on experimentation               in up-to-date laboratories to enable a wide variety of students                 to understand, first-hand, the rigors, creativity, and excitement               of modern scientific inquiry.  The acquisition of a computer-                   driven spectrophotometer with appropriate software and plotter,                 portable colorimeters, and dyeing equipment will upgrade                        laboratory instruction, reducing student frustration with failure               of old equipment and increasing the range of experiments students               will perform.  This project will strengthen the F.I.T. model of                 integrating professional education with relevant instruction in                 basic sciences, mathematics, and liberal arts",
