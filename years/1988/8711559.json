 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning project examines the potential for systematic                     research on data sharing.  The planning activities include                      conferences on normative and empirical issues in data sharing in                the social sciences.  In the first conference a small                           interdisciplinary group will identify and clarify these issues                  and the kinds of empirical inquiries that could provide useful                  information to assess and resolve them.  One or more                            publications discussing the main normative issues and needed                    empirical research will result from this conference.  The second                conference will include members of the first group and some                     additional participants.  It will focus on transforming one high                priority empirical question into a viable research project, and                 proposal on this topic will be submitted to NSF.                                                                                                                Issues of data sharing are both central and complex questions for               science to address.  Little systematic work has been done on                    them.  The project director and potential conference participants               are very well qualified to  begin these efforts.  This project                  should provide useful results by itself and stimulate future                    efforts in this field.  For these reasons, support in the amount                of $15,000 is recommended.",
