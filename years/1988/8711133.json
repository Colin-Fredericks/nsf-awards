 "awd_abstract_narration": "The processes involved in the determination of a cell's                     developmental fate remain important problems in developmental biology.          During the development of an organism, both maternally-derived products         and zygotic compounds must interact within the developing embryonic cell        for proper specification of the cell's developmental potential. Using           the nematode C. elegans, zygotic lethal mutants affecting only                  embryogenesis will be isolated to assess the role of the zygotic genome         in early development.  Maternal effect lethal  mutants that appear to be        defective in specifying the gut lineage will be identified to analyze           maternal components required to specify a particular lineage.  The              expression of a subset of strict maternal effect lethal genes, par              genes, will be examined to gain some understanding of the mechanisms            involved in cytoplasmic partitioning.  Products for the par genes are           required for proper localization of cytoplasmic factors during the early        divisions of the C. elegans embryo.  Additional alleles at the par loci         will be isolated.  Par genes will be cloned by \"transposon tagging\"             following transposition mutagenesis.  The par genes will be sequenced           and the sequences used to prepare antibodies to par proteins.  Antibody         probes should allow a biochemical analysis of par gene products and             thus, provide information about the mechanisms involved in                      asymmetrically partitioning cytoplasmic components essential for proper         development.                                                                        One of the central problems in developmental biology is                     understanding how the division of a cell creates two unlike daughters           with different developmental fates.  It has been proposed that such             asymmetric divisions result from unequal positioning or partitioning of         cytoplasmic components. Dr. Shaw proposes an investigation of this              question using appropriate mutants of C. elegans.",
