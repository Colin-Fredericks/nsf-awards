 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this study is to determine the fundamental               processes that control structure and regulate the size of clonal                plant populations.  To date there has been surprisingly little                  agreement among ecologists as to how any plant population is                    regulated.  Dr. Silander has developed an approach that combines                field experiments with mathematical models, based on observations               of individual clone performance (i.e. size, growth rates,                       reproduction, etc.) and clone competition.  These models will                   provide specific predictions of clone population composition and                fluctuation which can be field tested.  This protocol has been                  used to accurately predict the fluctuations and species                         composition of annual plant populations.  The proposed study will               provide the same for clonal populations.                                                The experimental phase of the study will focus on clonal                populations of white clover raised in the field with perennial                  ryegrass.  Together these species form one of the dominant types                of agricultural forage communities found throughout the temperate               zone of the world.  This system is thus of considerable economic                importance.  Competition among white clover clones and between                  clover and ryegrass will be examined.  Furthermore the study will               examine the effects of environmental variation (temporal and                    spatial) on clover population fluctuations.  The study will                     provide an unprecedented understanding of the structure and                     composition of plant populations.  It will allow prediction of                  the population consequences of variation in genetic diversity,                  environmental variation and grassland management regimes.  Thus                 the study has significant application for agricultural systems as               well as providing basic knowledge of the ecology and population                 biology of white clover.",
