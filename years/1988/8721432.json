 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Judith River Formation of Montana has historical significance               as the source of America's first dinosaur fossils, which were                   described in Philadelphia by Joseph Leidy in 1856.  However, the                formation has since been frustrating as a source of dinosaur                    fossils.  Beds of similar age farther north in Alberta and farther              west in north central Montana have proved to be more productive.                A dinsosaur bonebed discovered in 1981 in Judith River sediments                near Shawmut, south central Montana, is the richest yet found in                the Montana Judith River, and the southernmost productive site                  from this formation.  Among the taxa represented are a new genus                of ceratopsid (Avaceratops lammersi Dodson 1986), a giant                       hadrosaur, very rare postcrania of a pachycephalosaurid, and                    juvenile hadrosaurs and ceratopsids that occur with a higher                    frequency here than at most other contemporary sites.  Work                     initially focused on the Careless Creek Quarry, but prospecting                 has revealed a number of sites in the area, so it is proposed to                establish an environmental transect from west to east towards the               Interior Seaway.  A 25 km transect has been established, at the                 eastern end of which are found oysters, sharks and teleost fishes.              Analysis of faunal changes across the transect will permit a                    better understanding of the ecological determinants of dinosaur                 distribution.",
