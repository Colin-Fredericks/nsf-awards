 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the research program is to investigate                         experimentally and semi-theoretically nucleate boiling from a                   copper-graphite composite surface.  The composite (under                        development by SPARTA, Inc.) consists of ultra-high thermal                     conductivity graphite fibers consolidated in a copper matrix.                   The composite has a high thermal conductivity in the fiber                      direction which is several times those in the other directions.                 Due to the size of the fiber, it could significantly enhance the                nucleation site activity.  The proposed research will determine                 the heat flux, site population density, bubble growth rate,                     bubble departure frequency and bubble departure size.  This                     project is a cooperative effort of the University of Michigan and               SPARTA, Inc.                                                                                                                                                    The Sparta's Copper/Graphite composite has been used as the                     higher temperature material in the nose cone of the NASA space                  shuttles.  Due to its large number of very thin graphite fibers,                the composite is expected to remove a large amount of heat per                  unit area in the form of nucleate boiling.  If the concept is                   experimentally verified, then the use of the composite in                       industry will be very broad, for example, in the cooling of                     electronic units.  This research is a proof-of-concept type study               for the verification of its boiling performance.",
