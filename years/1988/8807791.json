The project will allow two researchers, an anthropologist and a                 social psychologist who have studied community institutions and                 local history in Southern Italy for over twenty years, to assess                the importance of factors such as conscience or grievance in                    individual involvement with the antimafia movement, organized                   around criticism of this Sicilian institution, and to analyze the               movement as an agent of cultural change.  The project will also                 study the reaction of the \"Sicilianist\" movement, which objects                 to any criticism of an indigenous phenomenon as calling critical                attention to Sicily and focusing on negative aspects of local                   culture.  The methods include interviews with activists on all                  sides of the movement, surveys of documentary resources, and                    participant observation over two summers.",
