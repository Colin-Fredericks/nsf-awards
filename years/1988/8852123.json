 "awd_abstract_narration": "An integrated approach by which the student is repeatedly presented             with the concept of chemical kinetics in various courses.  Each                 exposure to the concept is presented in increasing complexity.  It is           the goal of the department to evaluate different methods of presenting          this difficult concept.  The faculty in each discipline have designed           an experiments which improves the laboratory curricula.  In the                 Introductory and General chemistry courses, a qualitative demonstration         in lecture and semiquantitative laboratory is being used.  In Organic           Chemistry, which is generally the second year of a chemistry program, a         thorough examination of the mechanism and other chemical parameters             (eg. steric hindrance) of a chemical reaction is being examined.  The           third year of the chemistry program includes Physical Chemistry where a         more detailed calculus based description of the chemical kinetics is            introduced to describe the mechanism and possible description of                reaction intermediates using mathematical models.  The fourth year of           the chemistry program includes Biochemistry,.  The student is being             introduced to enzyme kinetics where the mathematical descriptions               emphasized in Physical Chemistry are being applied to biological                catalysts and extrapolated to the processes occurring in living                 systems.  Other courses in the chemistry program are also teaching              these principles, but the contributing courses fall into a                      chronological sequence and utilize chemical kinetics in their                   curricula.  The students who are benefitting from these programs are            the chemistry majors, the students who are taking general education             courses, and those students with majors in science education, health            science and biology.
