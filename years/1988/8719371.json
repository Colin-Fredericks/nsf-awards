 "awd_abstract_narration": "During solar flares large amounts of energy are released.                  The energy release occurs in three phases.  The first phase is                  the precursor phase which is associated with slightly enhanced                  emissions and perhaps the emergence or rearrangement of magnetic                flux.  The second phase, the impulsive (sometimes called non-                   thermal) phase where the primary energy release occurs, is                      associated with the highest energy phenomena and a rapid increase               in intensity and volume of electromagnetic emissions.  The third                phase is the gradual phase which is characterized by lower energy               phenomena, a slow decay in the intensity of emissions and,                      sometimes, secondary energy releases.                                                This grant will support the development of a self-consistent               model for the propagation of energetic particles released in the                impulsive phase of solar flares down into the lower corona and                  chromosphere, the outer corona and interplanetary medium during                 the gradual phase.  The study seeks to provide a means for                      unifying existing models to produce a coherent and comprehensive                picture of plasma heating and energy transport during solar                     flares.                                                                              A knowledge of these processes is important for our                        understanding of mechanisms to accelerate or heat plasmas to high               energies and of the plasma and energy flow in the chromosphere                  and corona.  The results will provide a better basis for                        interpreting solar X-ray and radio emissions which will in turn                 provide new information for models of solar flares and similar                  high energy phenomena on other stars and planets.  The solar                    flare is the most energetic, explosive phenomenon affecting the                 terrestrial atmosphere.",
