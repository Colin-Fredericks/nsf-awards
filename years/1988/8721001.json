 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to perform a systematic study of azimuthal anisotropy                from shearwave splitting of the body-wave phase SKS.  We will                   estimate the azimuth of the fast direction and the differential                 travel time between the fast and slow components for all of the                 available digital stations.  this will provide a global map of the              radically averaged azimuthal anisotropy of the mantle.  In a                    preliminary study, we have successfully developed a simple and                  robust measuring technique yielding estimates for each SKS                      recording.  Anisotropy is clearly seen for several stations with                values as large as 2 seconds.  Since anisotropy most probably                   results from the preferred orientation of mantle crystals, it may               be used to study stresses associated with mantle flow as well as                present-day continental and oceanic tectonics.  In addition, our                preliminary results suggest that in at least one case, the                      anisotropy may reflect a fossil Archean stress field associated                 with shield formation.  This raises the intriguing possibility                  that anisotropy may additionally be used to study continental                   evolution.  For this reason, we will utilize tectonic, structural               geology, and crustal stress information, to determine if the                    observed anisotropy can be associated with present day tectonics                or with tectonic episodes in the past.",
