 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is for completion of a petrologic and geochronologic                       investigation of caldera-related volcanism of the southeast San                 Juan volcanic field.  The platoro-Summitville caldera comples,                  which includes voluminous pre- and postcaldera andesite to dacite               volcanoes, records the early development of the San Juan field.                 The relatively mafic compositions of the Treasure Mountain ash-                 flow tuffs and their association with postcaldera andesite lavas,               indicates that this magmatic system represents a primitive stage                in the growth of the large silicic magma body which formed                      subsequently under the central and western San Juan caldera                     clusters.  This is a field, petrologic, and isotopic study of the               entire caldera-related volcanic sequence of the southeast San                   Juan field, including the Masonic Park Tuff.  Although the basic                geochemical characterization of much of the sequence is nearly                  complete, additional isotopic analyses (Pb, Sr and Nd) will be                  completed and further petrologic work will be done on the tuffs.",
