 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns research in the area of stochastic                   games, dealing with both zero-sum and non-zero-sum games in                     finite and arbitrary state spaces.  THe value and Nash equilibria               in both discounted and undiscounted payoffs are considered.  The                following are the main problems of this project.  1. Find an                    efficient algorithm to solve undiscounted switching control                     stochastic games for value and optimal stationary strategies.  2.               Find an efficient algorithm to solve for Nash equilibria when the               stochastic game is non-zero-sum and one player controls the law                 of motion.  3.  Find an efficient algorithm to solve for pure                   optima; stationary strategies in games with perfect information                 or in games with additive reward and additive transitions.  4.                  Are there optimal stationary strategies for zero-sum stochastic                 games with additive transitions?  5.  Do switching control non-                 zero-sum games admit stationary Nash equilibria?  6.  Do they                   possess order field property?  Do discounted stochastic games in                arbitrary state space and compact action spaces possess Nash                    equilibria in stationary strategies when they belong to the                     special structured class such as ARAT, one player control or                    switching control 8.  Do undiscounted zero-sum games of the above               structured type possess value in stationary strategies when the                 state space is arbitrary?",
