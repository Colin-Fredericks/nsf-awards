 "awd_abstract_narration": "The control systems that regulate gas exchange in water-breathing and           air-breathing fishes are not well understood.  The purpose of these             studies is to identify the role of the major groups of sensory receptors        that influence gas exchange, and to begin to assess the central                 integration of this information which in turn controls the complex              branchial and aerial respiration patterns in these fishes.  The proposed        studies will test specific hypothesis about the anatomical location and         sensitivity of putative internally and externally oriented branchial            chemoreceptors and the significance of their diffuse and apparently             redundant arrangement in both water-and air-breathing fishes.  Further          studies will assess the role of air-breathing organ mechanorecptors in          respiratory control and ventilation perfusion matching.  The proposed           work will also test the hypothesis that air breathing in gar is not the         result of a centrally generated rhythm, but is reflex in origin.  These         studies should not only help us to better understand the control  of            bimodal gas exchange, but should help us to understand the changing             roles of the brain and peripheral nervous system during the evolution of        vertebrates that colonized the land environment.",
