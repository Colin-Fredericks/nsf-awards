Textures are measured in experimentally and naturally deformed                  samples y U-stage, X-ray and neutron diffraction and derive                     quantitative orientation distributions.  These measured patterns                are then be compared with theoretical predictions based on the                  Taylor theory but incorporating new developments such as relaxed                constraints, rate sensitivity anc cluster model, which provide                  physically more realistic assumptions than rigorous homogeneous                 strain.  From the comparison of texture patterns we obtain                      information about the strain path (e.g. simple versus pure shear                which wer would like to investigate in the belt of core complexes               in the Western United States) but the Taylor calculations can also              be used to evaluate plastic anisotropy and the most economic                    strain path.  New anisotropic flow laws in rocks with preferred                 orientatin take account of anisotropy which ranges between 10 and               20% in calcite, quartz or olivine rocks.  Finally, we use                       orientation distributions to calculate elastic anisotropy which is              known to exist in the crust and the mantle and of importance in                 evaluating seismic data.  The study concentrates on monomineralic               rocks but also is extended to polymineralic rocks.",
