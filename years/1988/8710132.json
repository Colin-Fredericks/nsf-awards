 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant permits Dr. Cant and his colleagues to study five                    species of non.human primates on the island of Sumatra. These                   include two species of gibbon, the oranutan and two monkey                      species.  These animals are of varying body size, have different                diets and move through the environemnt differently. The goal of                 this research is to study different positional behaviors and                    determine the factors which lead to varying methods of                          locomotion. To accomplish this the team will follow individual                  animals, photograph them with video and 35 mm cameras and record                activities. They will note the part of the canopy used, the                     method of locomotion, the posture of the animal and the range of                foods utilized.                                                                                                                                                 Prior work has made it clear that a number of factors influence                 positional behavior. These include the body size of an animal,                  the part of the canopy through which it most often moves and the                kind of foods it eats. To separate out these variables however is               extremely difficult. However the study of five species which                    occupy the same tropical rainforest allows different comparisons                between species pairs. Specific variables can then be varied                    while others are held constant. Since in several species males                  and females differ in body size, within species comparison is                   also possible.                                                                                                                                                  This research is important for several reasons. Physical                        anthropologists are interested in the relationship between body                 form and body function. This study should provide relevant                      information. Secondly the research will show how different                      species partition a tropical environment and help to explain how                the richness of the tropics has developed and is maintained.                    Finally, Dr. Cant's work will aid in wildlife management and                    assist in developing plans to preserve species which are facing                 extinction.",
