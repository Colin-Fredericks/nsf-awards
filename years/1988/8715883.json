 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between                          Prof. K.P.C. Vollhardt of the University of                                     California, Berkeley, and Dr. Max Malacria of the                               Universite de Lyon, France, in the area of the                                  synthesis of antiviral antibiotics. In particular, the                          project is aimed at the total synthesis of the                                  antiviral Aphidicolin.  Because of its antiviral and                            antineoplastic properties, the versatile, short, and                            efficient construction of this molecule has                                     considerable synthetic and medicinal significance.                              The goal of this work is to compare alternative                                 approaches to the synthesis of this antibiotic                                  developed by the two collaborators.  In both                                    approaches, cobalt is used as a catalyst to unravel                             the organo-molecular structures of the starting                                 material.  However, the mid-points of the process, in                           which new molecular structures are formed, are                                  conceptually different and follow different sequences                           of molecular formation and breakage.                                                                                                                            The U.S. and French researchers have worked together                            in the past; this award will facilitate increased                               interaction between their respective laboratories.                              Comparing the two approaches to the synthesis of                                Aphidicolin will provide important new insights into                            the scope and limitations of both methods.",
