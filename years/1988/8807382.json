 "awd_abstract_narration": "The microbial loop is now recognized as a component of                     planktonic food webs.  To what extent it serves as a source or                  sink to the classic food web of algae, zooplankton and fish is                  debated.  Studies of the effect of enrichment on community                      structure and fish stocks in oligotrophic British Columbia lakes                suggests that large cladoceran zooplankton are \"keystone\" species               determining the linkage of picoplankton production to higher                    trophic levels.  If suitable algal food is present in a lake to                 support large Daphnia populations, they may utilize some of the                 picoplankton production and provide a short, direct food chain to               fish.  This research will develop radioisotope methods for                      tracing and quantifying links between trophic levels which can be               used subsequently to investigate these suggestions.",
