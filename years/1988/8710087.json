 "awd_abstract_narration": "Uterine arginine esteropeptidase is an estrogen-responsive                 enzyme complex.  It consists of 2 components:  a membrane-bound                 activator (A)and the 78 kDa proenzyme of a trypsin like serine                  proteinase (B). Activation of the proenzyme is calcium dependent and            involves no change in molecular weight.  B hydrolyzes arginine esters           and actin and myosin. Both A and B increase in activity in the uterus           when estradiol (E2) is given to the rat.  The increase in A and B               activity are hormone and tissue specific.  To test the hypothesis               that this enzyme is important in the development of the uterus                  studies are proposed in three areas:  1)the mechanism of activation             of B by A and the role of calcium, 2) the mechanism ofthe E2                    response, and 3) studies directed toward identification of the                  functions of A and B.                                                                Estrogen stimulation of the immature rat uterus has                        pleiotropic effects which are not well understood at the molecular              level.  Responses in the first few hours after stimulation include              the induction of new protein synthesis, major changes in membrane               permeability, and alterations in the specific activity of some                  enzymes.  Later responses, 24-48 hours after stimulation, include DNA           synthesis and cell division. One of the early responses is the                  increase in specific activities of the two components of the complex            calcium dependent enzyme that is the subject of this study. The                 results of this research will contribute to our understanding of the            mechanisms by which estrogen affects uterine growth and development.",
