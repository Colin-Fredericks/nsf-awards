 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry provides                     support for the research of Dr. Maitland Jones, Jr., Princeton                  University. The work focuses on the properties of carbon                        species which lack the usual full complement of electrons. Such                 species, called carbenes, have both unusual physical and                        chemical properties. An understanding of their behavior is                      important as they are found to be intermediates in a variety of                 chemical reactions.                                                                                                                                             The spectroscopy and chemistry of substituted adamantylcarbenes                 will be investigated as will the study of gas phase reactions                   of polycarbenes. A new synthesis of one class of bridgehead                     double bond-containing compounds will also be sought as will                    other new sources and reactions of polycarbenes.                                A newly discovered photochemical source of dihalocarbenes will                  be used to continue the investigation of reports of                             non-sterospecific singlet carbene additions, and to see if the                  photochemically generated species differ in properties from the                 more conventionally produced intermediates.  The new route will                 be expanded into a general method for generating divalent                       carbon.  New compounds containing bridgehead double bonds which                 are kinetically stabilized by adamantyl blocking groups will be                 synthesized, as will a new class of bridgehead double bond                      containing molecules that benefit little from pyramidalization.                 Both the intermolecular and intramolecular reactions of                         carbenes with carboranes will be studied.  In the latter case,                  new carbon-boron bridged intermediates have been produced, and                  these will be used to study the effect of neighboring                           frameworks of carbon and boron on reactive intermediates.                       The first carbene alpha to boron will be synthesized and                        investigated.  An attempt will be made to synthesize both C-C                   and C-B carborynes.",
