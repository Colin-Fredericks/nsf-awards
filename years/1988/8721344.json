 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program is in the area of organometallic chemistry.                   The focus of the project is metallacycle complexes which play                   an important role as intermediates in numerous organometallic                   reactions such as cycloadditions of alkynes and olefin                          metathesis. The goal is the development of new transition                       metal-mediated cyclizations involving a carbene moiety and two                  equivalents of alkyne. Such a reaction is fundamentally                         different than the Pauson-Khand reaction and would ultimately                   allow for novel intramolecular cyclizations in which acyclic                    precursors are converted to fused tricyclic ring systems. The                   general approach will involve the formation of a                                metallacyclopentadiene-carbene intermediate either by the                       introduction of a carbene or carbene precursor onto a                           metallacyclopentadiene complex, or by the formation of a                        metallacycle from a complex already containing a carbene                        precursor.                                                                                                                                                      The development of an efficient cycloaddition reaction of the                   type under investigation would simplify greatly the laboratory                  synthesis of a wide variety of biologically important organic                   compounds.",
