 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this research are to 1) develop a technological base          for the manufacturing of microactuators; 2) investigate laminar flow            processes and transition to turbulence in smooth and microconfigured            channels; 3) establish experimental methods for monitoring fluid flows          down to the picoliters/sec range; and 4) develop the associated pumps,          valves and related elements for eventually creating a medium scale              fluidic (MSF) system.  Recent interest in microactuators with meso-             scale dimensions (100 nm -100 microns) comes from the success that has          been achieved in micromachining a variety of micromechanical                    structures such as gear trains, reciprocating elements, and                     canterlevered vibrators.  In most cases, these structures will operate          in or on fluids.  To take full advantage of this new, emerging field,           appropriate structures for distributing fluids in small channels and            chambers and for measuring physiochemical and biological processes              operating in the meso-scale range must be designed and manufactured,            and a knowledge base pertaining to fluid flow in such small spaces              must be generated.  When the geometric size of a structure is                   comparable to the characteristic dimensions of the fluid flow field,            effects and processes that are normally neglected at larger dimensions          may be important, e.g., scaling laws may have to be modified for meso-          scale systems.  These experimental observations will be compared with           theoretical results that are currently being carried out.",
