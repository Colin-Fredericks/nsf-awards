 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project is in                 the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the                 subfield of computer assisted chemical analysis.  In this                       activity, Professor Frank Settle of Virginia Military Institute                 and Professor Michael Pleva of Washington and Lee University and                their undergraduate research students in chemistry are                          collaboratively developing software systems that can be readily                 implemented on popular microcomputers for the purpose of optimally              selecting either the appropriate surface analysis techniques for a              particular sample to be characterized or the appropriate sample                 preparation protocol to be followed for the elemental analysis of               a sample.  The first of these \"expert systems\" enables a person                 who is unfamiliar with the capabilities and limitations of surface              analysis techniques to select those surface analytical methods                  which are most likely to yield meaningful data that are relevant                to the problem under investigation.  The second expert system will              enable a person who wishes to perform an elemental analysis on a                sample to select a sample preparation protocol that will lead to                analytical results which are optimally informative.  Upon                       completion, these two expert systems will be made available to the              scientific community at a modest cost through the National Bureau               of Standards (for commercial customers) and through Project                     SERAPHIM of the American Chemical Society (for educational                      institution customers).                                                                                                                                         This RUI activity continues research in applications of                         computational methodologies to problems in chemical analysis that               were initiated under NSF grant CHE-8517147.  This development of                expert systems drawn undergraduate research students in chemistry               into contact with sophisticated, commercially available data base               management software and leads them to the capability to customize               and modify such software as necessary for the successful                        development of optimized chemical methods selection systems.                    These pursuits also serve to acquaint undergraduate research                    students with a broad array of tools for sample preparation and                 characterization.  The anticipated primary benefit of this                      research is the continued development of the manpower and human                 resource base in area of analytical and surface chemistry.",
