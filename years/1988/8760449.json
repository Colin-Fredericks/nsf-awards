 "awd_abstract_narration": "Artificial Neural Systems (ANS) are extremely promising as a way                of achieving \"true intelligence.\"  The Japanese have challenged                 the U.S. to a multibillion dollar 10 year cooperative effort in                 this field which they call the Sixth Generation Computer.  The                  essence is to use many simple processors multiply and complexly                 interconnected.  Optics offers a three dimensionality for                       interconnects unapproachable by electronics.  In particular, the                technique proposed here can make 10E + 12 weighted interconnects                in parallel.  In addition, it allows continuous time operation,                 fast response, low power consumption, low cost, and all optical.                The Phase I effort is an exploration of the potentials and                      limitations of the all optical ANS.  Issues such as accuracy,                   speed, stability, size, and ability to accommodate various ANS                  paradigms will be studied.  In Phase II a generic ANS will be                   designed using commericial parts and its performance propertied                 will be predicted.  The contract will be with a Nodal Systems                   Corporation, a Company created solely to exploit the optical ANS.               One of its Principals, Dr. H. J. Caufield, is well known in all                 fields of optical computing.  A subcontract to the Center for                   Applied Optics of UAH provides further academic support.",
