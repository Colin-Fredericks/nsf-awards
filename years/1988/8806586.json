 "awd_abstract_narration": "Graptolites were marine colonial invertebrates that floated                in the world's oceans during Paleozoic time.  Their flattened                   remains are common in grey shales of this age, and they are                     important stratigraphic age indicators.  Dr. Charles Mitchell                   proposes to collect and  study graptolites that are preserved as                unflattened specimens in limestones.  These collections will                    reveal the intricacies of how the individuals grew and budded to                form colonies.  Dr. Mitchell will use a computer-based image                    analysis system in a quantitative study of morphology and growth.               These analyses will be combined with a cladistic analysis of                    evolutionary relationships, resulting in a clearer picture  of                  the early evolution of this important fossil group.                                  The proposed research represents an ambitious and very                     modern study of an important fossil group by a young                            investigator.  The project will help to establish procedures for                combining morphometric studies with phylogenetic analysis, and it               has potential for far-reaching impact on the study of colonial                  groups in general.",
