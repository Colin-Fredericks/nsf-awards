 "awd_abstract_narration": "Discrete Mathematics is a subject that is being pushed to the forefront         of mathematics curriculum revision, and there is considerable debate            over the topics that should comprise such an undergraduate course, and          over its placing in the curriculum sequence.  Many two year colleges are        currently developing a Discrete Mathematics course as a service course          for Computer Science.  Mathematics Association of Two Year Colleges of          New Jersey will offer a Workshop on Applications of Discrete                    Mathematics.  Dr. Fred Roberts of Rutgers University, who is recognized         as a major force in current Discrete Mathematics development will               conduct this workshop.  The workshop will consist of two sessions with a        summer between them.  Thirty participants from two year colleges in New         Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania will be chosen.  Discrete Mathematics           has become so important because of the enormous variety of applications         of the subject.  These workshops will explore such applications to              genetics, engineering, computer science, and social planning.  During           the three months between sessions, each participant will work on                individual or small-group projects.  The results of these projects will         be evaluated during the Fall sessions.  Participants will receive a             printed summary to the group's activities to share with colleagues and          students at their home institutions.                                                                                                                            In addition to NSF support, participants will contribute about 15% in           travel costs toward the project, and the grantee institution will               contribute another 5% in support costs.",
