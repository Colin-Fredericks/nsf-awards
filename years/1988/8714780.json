Baggio-Saitovitch at                             the Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Fisicas (Center for                          Physical Studies) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.                                    Theoretical studies of hyperfine interactions in                                matrix-isolated systems conducted by Ellis will be in                           close coordination with experimental work going on in                           the laboratory of Baggio-Saitovitch in Rio. Mossbauer                           spectroscopy will be used to study charge and spin                              distributions in nuclei. Experimental determinations                            will be made of hyperfine parameters such as isomer                             shift, quadrupole splitting and nuclear magnetic                                field. These studies are of chemical and materials                              interest.                                                                                                                                                       The investigators in both countries are outstanding                             and competent scientists. The subject matter is                                 important as is the collaboration between theory and                            experiment. Certainly the Brazilian team will benefit                           from the expertise of Dr. Ellis and the Northwestern                            infrastructure. The Brazilian group has done                                    outstanding work in Mossbauer studies of                                        matrix-isolated, small particle chemistry so the U.S.                           group will benefit from this experience.",
