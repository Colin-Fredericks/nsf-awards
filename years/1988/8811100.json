 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because of its critical location as a landbridge linking North and         South America, Panama has been an area of intense interest to                   climatologists, biologists, anthropologists, geographers, and other             scientists trying to reconstruct and interpret the distribution and             movements of plants, animals, and people in the Americas.  Because              movements of species have been influenced by the limited number of              natural environments on the isthmus, and because climatic changes have          altered the mix of environments dramatically over the last few dozen            millennia, reconstructing the environmental history of Panama is a              critical facet of research for a broad range of inquiries into the              paleoecology and paleoanthropology of the Americas.  This project is            part of a larger, integrated effort to gather and interpret evidence            that will substantially improve knowledge of the environmental history          of Panama.  Sediment cores have been gathered from lakes and bogs in            scattered parts of Panama, two sets of which provide especially good            records over periods as long as the last 26,000 years.  This project            will focus on analyzing the two sets of cores in laboratories, using            pollen, diatoms, and phytoliths in the cores to reconstruct the range           of species present in the vicinities of the core sites.  These data             will be integrated with data from other sites to develop more complete          records of environmental change in Panama than have been available              before.                                                                              The enhancement of the data-based environmental history of Panama          that will result from this project is significant in its own right, but         it also will assist scholars in many other lines of inquiry.  More              accurate reconstructions of vegetational change will permit                     climatologists to refine regional climatic histories, which will help           arbitrate current theoretical debates regarding the nature of post-             glacial climatic change.  Biologists and biogeographers will have more          detailed data for their analyses of the migration of species and the            character of response to environmental change.  Anthropologists will            find the data useful for better determining the timing and location of          human occupancy through the presence of pollen and phytoliths of                domesticated plants.  This project therefore provides opportunities for         increasing knowledge in a broad range of sciences.",
