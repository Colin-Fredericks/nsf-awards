 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research studies several aspects of the production                    documents by computers.  The central focus is on the manner in                  which characters are represented for discrete devices such as CRT               screens, laser printers, and digital phototypsetters.                                Image processing techniques such as digital filtering and                  spectral analysis are applied along with incremental scan                       conversion algorithms to select the pixels which are to be turned               on in representing a given character.  These techniques can                     produce both gray scale fonts for color and gray scale CRT's and                binary fonts for printers and typesetters.  The study attempts to               ascertain which digital filters, and with that parameters,                      produce the most legible type.  The resulting algorithms could be               used in printers or composition systems for real time scan                      conversion of characters from outlines, permitting type in an                   infinite number of sizes and orientation to be produced on demand               from a finite collection of outlines.                                                A second part of the study attempts to analyze the images                  present in text in terms of various image processing models of                  the initial stages of human vision.  The aim of this is to apply                similar digital filters to the production of characters as is                   presumed to be applied by the human visual system.  This, in turn               may point to greater understanding of choices which should be                   made by font designers and by scan conversion algorithms to                     improve the legibility and speed of computerized output.",
