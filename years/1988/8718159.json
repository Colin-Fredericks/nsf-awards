United States and Japanese participants will meet at the National               Institute for Physiological Sciences in Okazaki, Japan during April             1988.  The seminar will focus on recent developments in                         electrophysiology and biophysics which have advanced studies on                 understanding how the heart functions.  The major areas that will               be examined are ion channel current, ion transport systems,                     mechanisms of extracellular and intracellular regulatory signals,               and intercellular communication.                                                                                                                                Research in cardiac electrophysiology has progressed considerably               because of contributions from laboratories both in the United                   States and Japan.  Cooperative efforts between investigators in                 both countries have led to the development of several technological             and intellectual breakthroughs.  This seminar, by providing a forum             for the exchange of current research results and ideas, will                    promote continued cooperation and progress in the field.",
