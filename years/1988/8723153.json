 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most interesting and challenging problems in                    evolutionary biology is understanding the extent to which                       functional design and past evolutionary history effect the                      evolution of specialized morphological adaptations.  The proposed               study will investigate these factors in a highly specialized                    group of organisms -- nectar-feeding Old World fruit bats.  This                group is ideal for the study of feeding mechanisms in several                   significant ways.  The family includes species that specialize on               eating a variety of diverse foods and previous work has helped                  develop a hypothesis of their evolutionary history.                                  The proposed study will critically test the factors that                   appear to constrain the form, function, and evolution of the                    feeding mechanism in this group of nectar-feeding bats.  The                    research will include collection of data on the structure and                   function of the tongue using a variety of microscopic and                       computer-assisted imaging technology.  A predictive model of how                functional design is effected by evolution will be developed.",
