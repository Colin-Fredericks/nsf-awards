 "awd_abstract_narration": "Processes of colloid coagulation, polymer gelation and                          degradation, aerosol formation, Ostwald ripening in metals, even                galaxy clustering all involve a series of irreversible processes                including aggregation, fragmentation, feed, removal, and                        exchange.  In the past, most of these processes have been studied               in the narrow confines of a particular application.  In the                     present work, they are studied in their most general form, so                   that the overall nature and behavior of the kinetics can be                     understood.  Modern ideas of scaling theory (also called                        similarity solutions or self-preserving spectra) are applied, as                is the concept of fractals to the geometry of the clusters.  The                interest in these problems has expanded with recent computer                    studies of cluster aggregation.  Here computer simulation is used               to advance the theoretical understanding of these irreversible                  processes.  New specific explicit solutions for the time--                      dependent kinetics, with applications to a wide variety of                      fields, are given.  Kinetic trandition phenomena, such as                       gelation and shattering, are explored.",
