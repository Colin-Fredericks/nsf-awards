 "awd_abstract_narration": "A system for inducing mutagenesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae                   by insertion of Ty elements.  Ty elements fused to a GAL1                       promoter and marked with the HIS3 gene are induced to                           transpose from a plasmid to the genome of the host cell by                      plating on galactose.  Transposition confers the His                            phenotype on the his host strain after loss of the plasmid.                     Insertion mutations in mating-type genes in MATa cells are                      selected by resistance to growth arrest by alpha-mating-type                    pheromone.  Genetic analysis and Southern hybridization have                    identified 9 TyHIS sterile mutants, including one in ste2 and                   4 which activate the silent mating-type cassette, HMLalpha.                     Unlinked suppressors have appeared in 3 of the HMLalpha-                        activated mutants, and will be analyzed in other Ty insertion                   mutants and in SPT and spt strains.  Further experiments will                   refine the induction protocol to reduce insertion of multiple                   Ty elements, and simplify the process of identifying new HIS                    marked mutants by selecting random haploid progeny and                          screening for the co-segregation of the His phenotype with                      the mutant phenotype.  Mutagenesis by Ty insertion to                           activate cryptic genes in other systems in addition to the                      mating-type genes will be attempted.                                                                                                                            This system, if successfully developed, will provide a useful                   tool for scientists in research laboratories.  It will also                     serve to introduce community college students to state-of-                      the-art molecular genetics.",
