 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research has two basic objectives:  (1) to learn more              about how people make complex decisions, and (2) to develop and test            computer-based decision support systems that are intended to improve            the quality of such decisions.  The research considers two factors              that make decisions difficult.  The first is uncertainty about what             the consequences of each decision alternative will be, especially in            cases where there is the risk of a substantial loss.  The second is the         presence of multiple objectives that conflict with one another, thus            forcing decision makers to make tradeoffs among objectives.                                                                                                     Two types of research activities are proposed. It involves laboratory           and field studies designed to learn more about intuitive decision               making strategies and the potential biases and other shortcomings of            these strategies.  Such research is important because it allows the             anticipation potential biases or errors that may result from intuitive          decision making processes.  Second, computer software will be designed          to improve the quality of decisions involving risk and conflicting              objectives.  Such computer-based decision support systems are                   important because they may significantly improve decision making                processes in business, government, medicine, and engineering.  They             may even be helpful to consumers making complex decisions involving             substantial financial or health outcomes.",
