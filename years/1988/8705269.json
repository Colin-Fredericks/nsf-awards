 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abundant hyporheic (interstitial riverine) biota were collected                 within a grid of shallow (10m) wells as far as 2.5 kilometers                   from the channel of the Flathead River, MT, which confirms a                    greatly extended spatial dimension in river ecology.  This                      research addresses several community level hypotheses in an                     attempt to describe and differentiate the hyporheic fauna                       (microbes and invertebrates) and the functional role of the                     hyporheic zone in influencing biota and processes in the benthos                (channel) of alluvial rivers.                                                                                                                                   Flathead River hyporheic Plecoptera are very abundant and                       intraspecific selection pressures resulting in reproductive                     isolation is suggested by the presence of polymorphic                           populations.  The project will also involve the reproductive                    strategies of these stoneflies.  The energy base of the                         apparently complex hyporheic food web is unknown, and it is                     hypothesized that interstitial entrainment of riverine detritus                 (POM) is important.  Discharge from the hyporheic is apparently a               significant source of nitrate and biologically active phosphorus                in the river.  If these nutrients are derived from communition of               riverine POM within the hyporheic food web, then the research                   will lay a new conceptual foundation for eosystem-level questions               in river ecology.",
