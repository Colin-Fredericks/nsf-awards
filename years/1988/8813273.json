 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the proposed research is to develop new concepts,                methods, and algorithms for the decentralized control of complex                nonlinear systems.  These systems are characterized by high                     dimensions, uncertainty, and information structure constraints.  The            main thrust of the research is directed toward the development of new           decomposition methods and algorithms for a \"piece-by-piece\" design of           control and estimation structures for complex plants.  These                    algorithms can be implemented by using the modern parallel                      multiprocessing architectures.  Of special interest are the graph-              theoretical methods for tearing of dynamic systems because of their             inherent simplicity and numerical reliability.  The partitioning                framework includes the overlapping decompositions of nonlinear systems          involving the unorthodox notion of subsystems that share common parts.          This type of decomposition can succeed where the standard disjoint              compositions fail.",
