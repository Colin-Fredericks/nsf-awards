 "awd_abstract_narration": "To search for the possible existence of the H particle, a                  strangeness minus 2 dibaryon, and thus test the two step                        reaction mechanism and a special two compartment cryogenic                      target.  The kaon charge exchange reaction will be used to                      produced cascade minus particles in the liquid hydrogen part of                 the target.  The cascade minus will be slowed down and stopped                  in the liquid deuterium part of the target to form a cascade                    minus deuterium atom which can decay to the H particle by                       neutron emission.  The neutron from this reaction will be                       monoenergetic and its energy will be measured by time of flight                 techniques.  The signature for the H particle will be a peak in                 the neutron time of flight spectrum.  The experiment will be                    performed in a new high momentum beam line to be built at the                   Brookhaven AGS.  The project will permit the collaboration of                   Professor Stearns, of Vassar College and physics majors from                    Vassar in these experiments.  This project should lead to the                   strengthening of the physics major at Vassar particularly                       through the enrichment of an advanced laboratory course and a                   course in Modern Physics taught by the principal investigator.",
