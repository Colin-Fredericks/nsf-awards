 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research proposal is concerned with the device design, device              material optimization, and fabrication and characterization of a novel          FET structure based on real-space transfer of 2-D electrons within a            quantum well.  The research will be carried out under mutually agreed           collaborative arrangements between the PSU Center for Electronic                Materials and Devices (CEMD), and the Electronic Technology and                 Devices Laboratory (ETDL), US Army Research and Development Command,            Ft. Monmouth, NJ.  This effort will be under the newly established NSF          and US Army Joint Research Program involving universities and US Army           Research Laboratories.  A PSU graduate assistant working under the              principal investigator will be given access to the extensive                    microelectronics facilities that exist at the ETDL where device grade           materials growth and processing for device fabrication will be carried          out jointly by him and the ETDL technical and scientific staff.                                                                                                 The research effort will involve optimization of the MBE-grown                  AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure III-V material for the proposed real-space          transfer FET structure, fabrication of the test device structures,              their electrical characterization for determination of performance              limitation, and interpretations of measured characteristics through             theoretical modeling.  The first year study will be conducted based on          a test structure that has evolved as a result of a one-year NSF grant           under its \"Expedited Award for Novel Concepts\" program.  The results            of the first year study will be translated into an improved version of          the novel device structure and its characteristics will be                      investigated.  The emphasis of this study will be on the practical              usefulness of the fabricated test device structures in high speed III-          V switching integrated circuits.",
