 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ancient societies have left visible evidence of their social               systems in material remains.  One of the most important types of                evidence of social differences can be found in mortuary remains.                This research project is designed to test theories dealing with                 the extent of social differentiation and the development of                     social complexity in Egypt during the Middle Kingdom as evidenced               in mortuary cults.                                                                   Specifically, the student will analyze the problem of the                  rise of the middle class.  To do this, she will conduct an                      intensive survey and excavate a sample of graves in the cemetary                at Abydos, southern Egypt.                                                           Status differentiation and the rise of complex societies are               classic problems in archaeology.  Ancient Egyptian societies are                unusual in the degree to which the mortuary cult permeated every                facet of social and political organization.  Unfortunately, in                  the past, much work has focused on the spectacular, ignoring                    important questions of variability.  This timely project will                   help to remedy this situation and provide new information for                   understanding the development of hierarchical social                            organizations.",
