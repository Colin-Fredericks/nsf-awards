 "awd_abstract_narration": "The deep sea is characterized by low temperatures and high                      hydrostatic pressures. These factors are known to influence                     biochemical processes. All of the proteins and membranes of deep-               living fishes experience these parameters, and thus these factors               may serve as important selective forces shaping the molecular                   evolution of organisms colonizing and inhabiting the hydrostatic                pressures typical of the deep-water environment in shaping the                  evolution of (1) membrane function, (2) the structural stability                of proteins, and (3) the function of enzymes.  Comparisons of the               function of membranes and proteins of related teleost fish                      species which occur at different depths in the ocean will be made               under conditions of varying hydrostatic pressure.  These studies                are designed to identify depth-related differences and to                       provide an understanding of which steps in biochemical processes                are susceptible to pressure perturbation, the importance of these               perturbations for colonization of deep water, what types of                     adaptations are employed to cope with these pressures, and what                 role depth per se plays in speciation and evolution in the marine               environment.",
