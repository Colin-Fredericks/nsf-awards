 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project in mathematical physics has to do with the                    rigorous analysis of renormalization group techniques used in a                 heuristic fashion by physicists.  ( The basic physical problem is               to determine macroscopic properties of large systems of particles               with known short range interactions. )  Some of the work involves               a novel use of the computer to assist in finding proofs of                      theorems that require intricate schemes for estimating                          quantities.                                                                          Renormalization group techniques have proved to be a                       powerful tool in statistical mechanics, especially in the theory                of critical phenomena.  The same techniques also play a dominant                role in the modern approach to constructive quantum field theory.               Much of the current research in these two areas is concerned with               the extension of present methods from relatively simple to more                 realistic systems.  Professor Koch will continue his                            investigation of models relevant to the theory of critical                      phenomena.  His second main emphasis is an analysis of disordered               systems such as the Hopfield model and the Sherrington -                        Kirkpatrick model, which exhibit spin glass behavior for a                      certain range of parameters.",
