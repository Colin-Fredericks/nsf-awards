 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new approach to radiation hardening of thermally grown Si02 is                proposed which will change the way we think about the oxidation of              silicon, and could lead to a radiation hardening process, which                 simultaneously produces minimum densities of electrically active                defects, based on fundamental understanding rather than empirical               recipes.  This new approach is based on the premise that the oxidation          kinetics of silicon, and the electrically active defect densities that          determine radiation sensitivity and device performance are determined           by the intrinsic strain resulting from the volume expansion that                occurs when silicon oxidizes.  The basic idea is to control the                 electrically active defect densities by changing the intrinsic strain           by processing.  Changes in intrinsic strain are related to processing           by viscous flow of the oxide relieving strain.  To quantitatively               evaluate the relation between intrinsic strain and processing,                  intrinsic strain will be varied by preparing samples in a matrix of             oxidation conditions (temperature, oxygen pressure, thickness, time,            partial pressure of water vapor).  To determine the effect of each of           these conditions, only one will be varied while all the others are              kept fixed in each set of the matrix, and electrically active defect            densities measured as functions of changes in intrinsic strain on the           same samples in each set.  It is expected that an optimum set can be            found in which the electrically active defect densities are minimized.          Samples prepared by the optimum set then will be tested for radiation           hardness.",
