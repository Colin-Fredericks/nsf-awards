 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support ongoing collaborative research between                  Dr. Paul Hodge, Department of Astronomy, University of Washington               and Dr. Harvey MacGillivray, Royal Observatory, Edinburgh, U.K.                 The researchers propose to study the outer structure of the local               group of dwarf irregular galaxies, especially NGC 6822 and IC                   1613.  Dwarf irregular galaxies are among the most common type of               space galaxies, but their structure, especially in their outer                  regions, remains relatively unexplored.  In the local group, the                Magellanic Clouds have been the subject of a large number of                    structural studies; however the next two dwarfs (in order of                    luminosity)                                                                     NGC 6822 and IC 1613 are very poorly understood.  The outer reaches             of these galaxies are likely to provide considerable information                about the distant past history of the galaxies themselves, as they              are less affected by the recent star-forming events that are found              in the denser, central regions.  And, even more important, it is                the outer, low-density regions that are most affected by external               influences, e.g, gravitational interactions with more massive                   galaxies or gravitational support by a possible massive halo.  The              investigators propose to use deep, wide-field Schmidt plates to                 explore the outer structure of these galaxies.  The plates will be              scanned in Edinburgh with the COSMOS machine and the data will then             be processed with the new Edinburgh software, developed to allow                work even in very crowded fields.  The stars will be                            cross-identified to allow construction of color-magnitude diagrams              from which foreground stars are subtracted.  This will enable the               investigators to discern the stellar population at different                    positions and distances from the center of the galaxies.                                                                                                        Dr. Hodge is a leading expert in dwarf galaxy structure.  The                   Edinburgh astronomers have many years experience in methods of                  extracting the most complete and reliable scientific information on             galactic structure from star distributions counted automatically                from deep Schmidt plates.  They have developed analysis techniques              specifically designed to overcome the difficulties that can lead to             systematic errors in automated star counting due to background                  change and crowding.  The results of this research will be of great             importance for our understanding of both stellar and galaxy                     evolution.",
