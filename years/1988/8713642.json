 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pilot studies (Phase I, 1986 SBIR solicitation) showed that             the infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) was reversibly               adsorbed onto affinity media.  This important first step of                     concentrating waterborne viral antigen allowed vaccines to be                   made and tested.  Some conferred good protection against disease                challenge.  Only short-term protection was tested -  results are                encouraging and should translate into detailed specifications for               affinity adsorbents used to make cost-effective vaccines against                viral diseases such as IHNV in salmonids.                                                                                                                       This project will attempt to develop a vaccine for the IHNV                     disease of salmon.  The research will examine bonding properties                (core polymers to co-sorbents to virus) and antigen                             adsorption/desorption under controlled ionic strength, pH, solute               quality, etc.  This information will be used to optimize antigen                concentration, treatment, and transfer to trout.  Acceptable                    affinity media will be reasonably specific, have bond energies of               the right order, and be economical.  In addition, responses to                  antigen challenges to include large populations in natural                      epizootics and compare them with other virus models.  Infectivity               is to be screened and titered by standard cell culture methods,                 antigen...quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and                 protection...estimated by vaccinated animals better survival over               controls after pathogen challenge.                                                                                                                              Correlations among these results will dictate further development               and commercialization of a vaccine for IHNV disease of trout.                   The vaccine's composition, form, and prescribed delivery must                   permit trout to take up antigen and stimulate protection against                natural infection over sufficiently a long term.   And it must be               practical.",
