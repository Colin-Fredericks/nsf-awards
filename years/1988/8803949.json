James R. Craig and Robert J. Bodnar of the Virginia Polytechnic            Institute and State University and Messrs. LIN Gen Fan and WAN Xin              of the East China Geological Exploration Company of the Chinese                 Ministry of Metallurgical Industry (MMI), is jointly sponsored by               NSF and by the Chinese MMI.                                                                                                                                     This joint research aims at a detailed geological investigation into            the ore deposits of a major, but little known, metallogenic province            in east central China, the Tongling area of Anhui province.  This               area contains a large number of skarn and stratabound massive                   sulfide deposits that contain mineable or potentially mineable                  quantities of base metals and gold, specifically copper gold skarn              deposits, stratabound copper gold deposits, and gossan gold                     deposits.  The investigators seek to define the conditions under                which these deposits formed and to determine if the two different               deposit types are genetically related.  To achieve this, detailed               petrographic and electron microprobe analyses of ore and gangue                 minerals will define the mineralogy and mineral chemistry within the            deposits and seek to establish a comprehensive paragenetic                      sequence.  At the same time, detailed fluid infusion studies,                   including standard microthermometry and laser Raman analyses, will              define the composition and physical state of the mineralizing                   fluids.  This study of gold deposits in distinctly different                    geological settings and apparent genesis provides an opportunity to             discover new aspects of the geochemical transport and deposition of             gold.  Specifically, study of these ore deposits may provide                    valuable information about the evolution of gold bearing                        hydrothermal systems, by exploring the relationship between deposits            that are clearly related to igneous activity, such as the skarns,               and those that are hosted entirely in sediments (the stratabound                deposits) and spatially unrelated to an intrusive body.  The new                insight into gold ore genesis promised by this research could lead              to new exploration strategies and techniques useful both in the                 United States and in China.",
