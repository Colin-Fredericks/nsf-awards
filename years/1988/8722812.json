 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to determine conditions that will              inhibit sulfate reduction to hydrogen sulfide in bioreactors used to            anaerobically digest sludges derived from treatment of wastewater.              Experiments will be conducted in batch cultures to determine the                effectiveness of inhibitors, the importance of inhibitor/antagonist             rations, and their mechanism of action.  Modes of inhibitor addition            will be studied in attached-film digesters both during start-up and             with established biofilms.  Attached-film studies to determine the              effect of feed strength, organic loading, and diffusion limitation on           the competitiveness of the sulfate-reducing bacteria are planned.                                                                                               Anaerobic reactors are widely used for stabilization of organic matter          in wastewater treatment plants.  this project is likely to provide              guidance to engineering designers for process improvement that will             reduce or eliminate problems resulting from production of hydrogen              sulfide during operation of this process.",
