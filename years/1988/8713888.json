 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Schechter, at the Mount Wilson and Las Campanas Observatories               of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, is conducting an                     observational research project which consists of three separate                 but related components, all of which will aid the construction of               three dimensional models of the mass of the Milky Way Galaxy.                   The project focuses on using three different tracers of mass to                 determine the relative contributions to the mass of our Galaxy                  from the disk, the bulge, and the halo.                                                                                                                         It has proven especially difficult to determine the relative                    contributions of a disk, a bulge, and a dark halo to the total                  masses of external galaxies.  A better understanding of the                     relative importance of dark and luminous matter in a galaxy is a                prerequisite to understanding how galaxies formed.  The premise                 underlying Dr. Schechter's research efforts is that projection                  effects make it virtually impossible to construct well                          constrained models of the mass for external galaxies.  However,                 in the Milky Way one can measure all three components of position               and velocity for a wide variety of tracers of mass.  Our                        knowledge of the mass distribution in our Galaxy can then be                    applied to understanding the structure of other galaxies.",
