 "awd_abstract_narration": "Light from the sun drives the chemistry of the atmosphere.                 The chemistry is initiated by the absorption of light by various                gases.  Furthermore, each gas absorbs the various colors                        (frequencies) of the light (the electromagnetic spectrum) with                  varying efficiency.  This efficiency is an important factor for                 how deeply into the atmosphere a given color can penetrate and                  consequently at what altitudes a particular chemical pathway                    will be important.  In the upper atmosphere, very energetic                     photons (colors of high frequencies) representing the vacuum                    ultraviolet (VUV) region of the electromagnetic spectrum are                    weakly absorbed by molecular oxygen, the second most abundant                   gas in the atmosphere.  Molecular oxygen is therefore important                 for the removal of these photons.  The absorption efficiency                    (or cross section) of oxygen in this spectral region is                         particularly difficult to measure because of a complicated                      system of narrow absorption lines known as the Schumann-Runge                   bands.  Accurate measurements require careful work with high                    resolution of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Other important                    processes in the upper atmosphere involve the absorption of                     VUV by nitrogen oxide (NO) which similarly has a complicated                    spectrum whose absorption cross sections are inadequately                       known.                                                                               This project is a continuation of research supported by                    NSF under Grant ATM-8318960.  VUV cross section measurements                    of oxygen and nitrogen oxide will be performed with a recently                  constructed VUV Fourier transform spectrometer that can achieve                 a high spectral resolution necessary for determination of                       absolute cross sections of molecular bands possessing distinct                  rotational structure.  Cross sections are to be obtained at                     temperatures of 78K and 300K.  These data will allow more                       accurate modeling of the transmission of energetic light                        through the upper atmosphere than is currently possible and                     will benefit various research efforts in atmospheric chemistry                  and aeronomy.",
