 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on interdisciplinary aspects of                      electrical engineering design.  Within the many sub-domains in                  electrical engineering, millions of varieties of products are                   designed with widely different design emphases.  Advances in design             methodologies in one sub-domain often inspire similar advances in               other sub-domains.  Initially, the study will be confined to the                domains of electrical machinery, filters, and control systems.                        The plan is to create a multiloop feedback design approach                (MFDA) based on existing methodologies:  hierarchical decomposition,            system and components modeling, parameter optimization, per-unit                analysis, design standardization, performance and cost-effective                analysis, fuzzy set theory, and knowledge based systems.  The                   research will result in the formulation of a common MFDA and will               investigate the overall design optimization process with emphasis on            the dichotomy property and convergence of the feedback process to an            optimum design.  The MFDA will be tested against existing design                methods in each sub-domain.  The ultimate goal is the formulation of            an interactive design process, based on the MFDA, in which the                  computer assists a designer to improve the quality of the designs.",
