 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will establish a National Science Foundation \"Research               Experiences for Undergraduate\" site in southeast Wisconsin for                  two years.  Eight highly qualified undergraduates will be                       recruited this summer to conduct research at one of two                         locations comprising the site: the Biomedical Research Institute                laboratories on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-                      Parkside in Kenosha or the laboratories of the departments of                   biochemistry and microbiology at the Medical College of Wisconsin               in Milwaukee.  Based upon extensive experiences with                            undergraduate research together with active research programs, 12               faculty representing the focus of Molecular and Regulatory                      Biology will serve as potential project supervisors.  This                      program is designed to develop each participant's intellectual                  confidence, technical competence and research independence via:                 1. Guidance by active researchers in the areas of Molecular and                 Regulatory Biology.                                                             2. A program of specific goals for each student's research                      progress via a meeting and seminar schedule plus instruction in                 literature search and seminar presentation techniques                           complementary to each project.                                                  3. Amplification of the NSF effort through a commitment to carry                over meritorious students for a second summer of research using                 internal funding.                                                               4. Aggressive regional recruitment of superior candidates with                  special efforts to attract minorities and women plus housing                    arrangements proximate to the UW-P laboratories and,                            5. Immediate and long-term evaluation of the NSF-REU experience.",
