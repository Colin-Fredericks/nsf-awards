 "awd_abstract_narration": "The form taken by long-haul computer networking is largely                 determined by the service offerings and associated tarriffs of                  the local and long-distance communications carriers.  This                      observation accounts for many of the differences- as well as the                similarities- among national computer networks in Europe, for the               slow implementation of, Pan-European networks, and for the unique               structure of U.S. networks such as ARPANET, MFEnet, and NSFNET.                      Although it can be argued that the telephone companies are                 by nature ponderous and unresponsive, and hence constitutionally                unable to meet the demands of the scientific research community                 for increasingly high-performance, full-featured networks, it may               on the other hand be the case that scientists and the carriers                  have never met together in a serious attempt to understand the                  growth rate of the former's needs, and the capacity of the latter               for change.                                                                          Danny Cohen and Jon Postel propose to form a small working                 group and to hold a series of intensive meetings to plan                        proposals for communication services useful to the computer                     communication community that might be requested of the carriers.",
