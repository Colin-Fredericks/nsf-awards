 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work is a continuation of work on interprocedural data-flow                analysis and optimization in a programming environment.  The new work           will emphaize three main directions.                                                                                                                            1.   Algorithms for interprocedural analysis that produce sharper                    information than standard techniques.  This includes                            formulations of the side effect problems that determine the                     largest subsection of an involved array, improvements to                        constant propagation to retain valuable information discarded                   by current methods, and approximation methods for flow-                         sensitive sets.                                                                                                                                            2.   Incremental methods for returning a program to a consistent                     state after a change to one or more of its constituent                          subparts.  In a compiler that uses interprocedural                              information, three distinct problems arise:  correcting the                     interprocedural information to reflect the new state of the                     program, determining which modules must be recompiled because                   of changes to the interprocedural information, and                              regenerating compiled code for those modules.                                                                                                              3.   A global approach to optimization that uses interprocedural                     information to direct the optimization of the program as a                      whole.  In such a scheme, the compiler examines the entire                      program to plan application of optimizations like linkage                       tailoring or active record merging, and determines what                         levels of optimization are merited for individual entry                         points.                                                                                                                                                    The setting for this research will be the compilation system of the Rn          FORTRAN Programming Environment.  The environment has been designed as          a test bed for research into whole program analysis and optimization.           Currently, it is being extended to perform incremental dependence               analysis in support of parallel programming research.",
