 "awd_abstract_narration": "A perennial problem in the sociology of gender concerns the                     inequality of earnings between men and women.  Various                          explanations have been offered for this inequality, including                   discrimination, women's family responsibilities, and                            differences in men's and women's human capital and other                        characteristics.  These factors also produce occupational                       segregation, wherein men and women occupy different jobs (labor                 market segmentation), which in turn contributes to wage                         inequality. This research explores the extent of, and reasons                   for, earnings inequality among men and women.  Using already                    collected data from 11 advanced industrialized countries, the                   study will examine differences within and between these                         countries in how earnings are shaped by men's and women's labor                 market locations, family statuses, and human capital.  Since                    these countries differ considerably in their industrial                         relations systems, political and economic institutions,                         policies facilitating (or hindering) the integration of work                    and family roles, and other characteristics this research                       design will be useful in identifying how these factors segment                  labor markets and contribute to gender inequality in earnings.                  The study draws on and extends existing sociological and                        economic explanations of the gender gap in earnings.  Its                       principal contribution will be the systematic exploration of                    differences by country and the attempt to explain them on the                   basis of political, economic, social, and cultural differences                  among nations.",
