 "awd_abstract_narration": "A large number of toxins (such as paralytic shellfish                      toxins, tetrodotoxin and bactrachotoxin) are potentially lethal                 contaminants in seafood.  They are known to act by altering the                 conductance properties of a well-characterized sodium channel                   found in muscle and nerve tissues.  The objective of this study                 is to develop an enzyme-linked assay to detect these toxins.                    Enzyme or coenzyme conjugates of the toxin will be coupled with                 purified sodium channels for use on displacement assays to                      quantitate the amount of site 1 sodium channel toxins in the                    sample.  The assay is expected to have a sensitivity comparable                 to the radioimmunoassys currently used, but will avoid the                      hazards of handling radioisotopes.  It will also have a greatly                 improved cross-reactivity, thus enabling the detection of any                   site 1 toxin in a seafood sample.  In Phase I, enzyme and                       coenzyme conjugates of saxitoxin and tetrodotoxin will be                       prepared and tested in displacement assays using partially                      purified sodium channels.  In Phase II enzyme linked toxins                     will be compared to radiolabeled toxins for binding affinity to                 the sodium channel and for sensitivity in assays to detect                      unlabeled toxins.                                                                    The toxin assay developed will be extremely useful as                      screening test for the safety of seafood samples.  In addition,                 the reagents produced may aid in the study of sodium channel                    function.",
