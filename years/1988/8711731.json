 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning project examines the potential for systematic                     research on the impacts of national security controls on the                    conduct of research and the dissemination of unclassified                       scientific and technical information.  The objectives of the                    proposed assessment are (1) to determine the extent to which                    scientists and engineers understand the restrictions; (2) to                    assess how scientists and engineers attempt to balance the values               of openness with protection of the national interest; and (3) to                document the impact of such restrictions on research and the                    dissemination of scientific and technical information.  In this                 planning phase, a team of consultants with expertise about the                  substantive issues, the methodological aspects of the proposed                  assessment, and the perspectives of concerned constituencies,                   will assist the project staff in addressing the conceptual and                  technical difficulties associated with undertaking such an                      assessment.  Project staff will circulate a preliminary                         discussion paper to the team, whose members will meet to define                 and refine the research questions and design.  Staff will then                  circulate a draft of the agreed-on research instruments and plans               for data analysis to team members and two independent consultants               for further refinement.  Following this work, AAAS will submit a                final report, including the key research questions, instruments,                and plans for analysis to NSF.  The report will also address uses               which the assessment could serve.                                                                                                                               Issues of openness and secrecy in the communication of scientific               and technical information are central both to scientific progress               and human well-being.  Little systematic research has been done                 to them.  The project sponsor, staff and planning group members                 are very well qualified to begin these efforts.  This project                   should provide useful results by itself and stimulate future                    efforts in this field.  For these reasons, support in the amount                of $10,000 is recommended.",
