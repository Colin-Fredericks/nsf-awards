 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acetylcholine (ACh) is the neurotransmitter that allows nerves to               stimulate skeletal muscles to contract.  The muscle receptors                   that accept this ACh message are well described, and many                       compounds (referred to as cholinergic drugs) are known to act on                these muscle ACh receptors.  These same cholinergic drugs seem to               affect the nerves that innervate these muscles.  The drugs can                  affect the ability of the nerve to become excited (and generate                 action potentials), as well as affect the amount of ACh that can                be released by the nerves.  Due to technical complexities, these                drug actions on nerves have received much less attention than                   their affects on muscles.  This project will study the actions of               cholinergic drugs on the ability of nerves to become excited and                to release ACh.  Additionally, the nerve effects of these                       compounds will be compared to their muscle effects in order to                  see whether the nerve and muscle effects are related.  One                      hypothesis is that an acetylcholine receptor exists on nerves as                well as on muscles.  This project will examine whether                          cholinergic drug effects on nerves are consistent with actions at               these putative neuronal ACh receptors.  The project will provide                new information concerning cholinergic drug actions on motor                    nerves, and relate these actions to those on muscle endplates.                  Additionally, the investigations address a fundamental issue of                 neuromuscular transmission, role, if any, of motor nerve                        receptors for acetylcholine.",
