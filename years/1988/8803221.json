 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed study will examine ecological relationships                   among populations of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM)                     fungi.  The objectives of this work are to determine whether                    ecotypic differences exist among populations of these root                      endophytes and to examine their ranges of tolerence to                          environmental conditions.  Common garden experiments will be                    employed to determine if population variation among VAM fungi is                the result of genetic differentiation or phenotypic plasticity.                 Reciprocal transplant studies will be used to examine the ranges                of tolerance of populations to environmental factors.  Geographic               isolates of Glomus mosseae, a well known VAM fungus, from a range               of dissimilar environments are to be included in the experiments                and will be cultured on the roots of sudangrass and yellow                      sweetclover.  Both direct observations of the endomycorrhizal                   fungi and analysis of their effects on host plant growth and                    physiology will be employed to assay variation among and within                 G. mosseae populations.  The results obtained from this work will               provide valuable data on genetic makeup, geographic variation and               physiological specialization in VAM endophytes.  Further, this                  investigation will yield insights on the mechanisms of ecological               adaptation in natural populations of fungi in general and                       eventually may be beneficial in the selection of strains for                    specific uses.",
