 "awd_abstract_narration": "The atmosphere at mesospheric and lower thermospheric levels               (80 to 120 km altitude) is continually subject to the disturbance               of waves passing through the region, including diurnal and                      semidiurnal tides, planetary waves, and gravity waves                           originating at tropospheric levels which propagate upward with                  exponentially increasing amplitude, as the atmospheric density                  exponentially decreases with height.  The wave activity affects                 the chemical reactions producing airglow in several layers in the               region, and it is possible to study the wave properties                         (wavelength, direction of propagation, amplitude, etc.) and                     sometimes infer sources, by ground based observations of the                    airglow emissions at night using photometers and allsky imaging                 cameras.  This award is to initiate a program of such                           observations at an undergraduate institution, in cooperation with               researchers at other institutions using complementary radio and                 optical equipment.  The training of undergraduate students in                   atmospheric science, and the arousal of their interest in a                     possible research career, are added benefits of the activity.",
