 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Society on Oxygen Transport to Tissue (ISOTT)                 is dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge concerning metabolism                  and anabolite and metabolite transport in tissue.  ISOTT                        emphasizes a dual scientific and engineering approach, utilizing                interdisciplinary, theoretical, and experimental methodology to                 unravel the secrets of tissue maintenance, repair, growth, and                  replacement.  The Society was established to involve                            international scientists and engineers in the development and                   application of forefront techniques to allow a more basic                       understanding of the important physical/chemical/biochemical                    phenomena that are necessary for normal tissue functioning.  The                Society has made contributions in advancing the gross analysis                  techniques of the past to the synergistic studies of tissue micro               areas by the sophisticated mathematical and experimental means of               today.  Efforts have been directed towards the acquisition of                   knowledge at the regional tissue level, both in vitro and                       in vivo, and are now moving rapidly to the examination of                       fundamental biochemical reactions at the cellular level.  This                  work necessitates the use of today's most powerful computing                    machinery and the use of state-of-the-art experimental                          methodology, such as polarographic, auto radiographic,                          cytometric, and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques.                                                                                                          ISOTT's mission is to enhance the understanding of mechanisms                   that lead to tissue pathology, to overcome pathologic trends, and               to repair and replace nonfunctioning tissue.  The meeting results               will be published as a proceedings (usually by Plenum Press in                  its Advances in Medicine and Biology series), which will be used                as a reference throughout the world.",
