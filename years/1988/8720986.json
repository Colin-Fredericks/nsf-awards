 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to improve understanding of Stalinist economic               expansion by analyzing l928-l940 Soviet experience in a new way.                It uses a multiperiod, multisectoral programming model to trace                 interactions within the economy and quantify the impact of major                events (the initial overcommitment of resources, the                            collectivization of agriculture, world depression, and the drive                for rearmament).  Its data comes primarily from Soviet sources as               reconstructed by Western scholars, whose separate studies are                   linked and bolstered by the model's accounting structure.  A                    series of input-output tables provide a framework within which a                sequential linear programming model generates a reference                       solution reflecting the economy's growth potential.  Experiments                with parameter changes permit analysis of numerous scenarios                    estimating the impacts of specific events throughout the economy.                                                                                               The project builds on over a decade of preparatory research by                  the principal investigator.  Its evaluation of the results of                   Stalinist planning should be of interest not only to economists                 but also to political scientists, historians and others concerned               with the process of economic development.",
