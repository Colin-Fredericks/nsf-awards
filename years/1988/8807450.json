 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most                       powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                   the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                     substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                  molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                    molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                          spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out                      frontier research.                                                                                                                                              This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program                    will help the Chemistry Department of the RUI institution, Hope                 College, to acquire, operate and maintain a high-field  NMR                     spectrometer.  The acquisition of the instrument will enhance                   the ability of the Department to prepare undergraduates for                     possible careers in chemistry and will enhance research in the                  following areas:                                                                                                                                                1) Reactive bi-metallic early-late-transition metal complexes                   2) Preparation and polymerization of 1,2-dihydrocyclobuta\u0131b!-                      napthalene-4,7-dione and derivatives                                         3) Identification of biologically important compounds exuded                       from sorghum and other grasses                                               4) Biosynthesis of 3-deoxyanthocyanidins in sorghum: a model                       for anthocyanidin biosynthesis                                               5) Characterization of divalent germanium, tin and lead                            compounds by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy                                  6) Diastereoselective reactions of enolates with epoxides                       7) Competitive cyclyzations of epoxides to double bonds and                        aromatic positions.",
