 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is part of an overall plan to improve laboratory              instruction in the Biological Sciences through the introduction of              modern computer-interfaced equipment.  The plan develops the following          areas:  (1) the introduction of more quantitative physiological                 experiments, (2) the improvement of instruction involving computers,            (3) the application of the computer to data gathering and analysis and          to simulating  scientific phenomena, and (4) the introduction of                student research.  The course which accrues the greatest benefit from           these developments is Anatomy and Physiology.  However, the equipment           requested is being utilized in all Biology courses where appropriate.                                                                                                Because Marymount University enrolls women primarily and because           these women in science pursue careers in medicine, teaching, nursing            and research, the main benefit of these modern instruments is to                provide women with stronger qualifications for continuing graduate              studies or for entering science-based careers.                                                                                                                       The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
