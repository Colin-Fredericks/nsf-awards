 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this work is to develop a hollow fiber bioreactor              which makes use of an intercalated-spiral wound dual circuit                    construction.  The hollow fiber system is used to produce human                 monoclonal antibodies specific to tumor-associated antigens.  Human             monoclonal antibodies should be superior to monoclonal antibodies as            in vivo diagnostic and therapeutic reagents.  Many human hybridomas             secrete monoclonal antibodies at a much lower rate than murine                  hybridomas.  Hence it is crucial to develop processes which can                 produce human monoclonal antibodies effectively.  Problems in                   continuous production are investigated.  Data and system analyses are           complemented by mathematical models which incorporate hydrodynamics,            membrane transport and cellular kinetics.                                                                                                                       This project applies the principles of bioreactor engineering to mass           cell culture.  As demand for biochemicals from mammalian cell cultures          increases, there is a corresponding need to develop advanced                    bioreactor technology to produce not only in large quantitie, but also          effectively, biological compounds.  One important example is the                making of monoclonal antibodies.  Monoclonal antibodies are very pure           and have specific biochemical reactivities.  They have proven to be             very useful in many diagnostic and therapeutic applications.                    Antibodies are big and complex protein molecules which can best be              synthesized by (fusion) mammalian cells cultured in an advanced hollow          fiber bioreactor which mimics an artificial organ in the sense that             the bioreactor has a very uniform distribution of arterial and venous           capillary networks.  This is an attempt to understand the                       fundamental aspects of fluid mechanics, nutrient transport, and cell            physiology.  It is necessary to merge information from these different          areas to solve the general problem.",
