The two week workshop               will be held July 25 - August 5, 1988, at the National Weather                  Service Training Center in Kansas City, Missouri, for 25 selected               undergraduate college instructors of weather-related introductory               courses.  The major purposes of the workshop are  (a) to bring                  participants up-to-date on those technologies and techniques used               in meteorology to detect, analyze, and forecast weather, and (b)                to equip and encourage these teachers to use the latest in                      telecommunicated weather information and instructional materials                in their classrooms.                                                                                                                                            In addition to the NSF funds, participants' institutions will                   contribute about 15% in travel costs to the operation of the                    project.",
