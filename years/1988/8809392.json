 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although the 1965 Voting Rights Act has been hailed as                     perhaps the most successful piece of policy legislation enacted                 in the post-WWII era, scientific work examining its influence and               consequences has been remarkably absent.  While there are views                 about the Act's impact and a literature dealing with impact and                 implementation in a host of other legislative domains, most of                  the best scholarship dealing with the Act has been legal and                    constitutional despite the scope and importance of this piece of                legislation.  With some recent and important exceptions, most                   empirical work to date has been anecdotal or at a relatively low                level of conceptualization and methodological sophistication.                        Drs. Grofman and Davidson along with a team of cooperating                 investigators seek to remedy this situation through undertaking a               systematic, multi-site project.  The design includes each of the                seven states in the deep South originally covered by the Act and                selected other states in the Midwest and Northeast with                         substantial black and Hispanic populations and in the Southwest                 with significant Mexican-American, Native American, or black                    populations.  A minimum of four data bases will be formed: (1) a                before and after data base for all jurisdictions which have                     shifted from at-large to a single-member district or mixed                      system, (2) a longitudinal data base on changes in minority                     representation in a random sample of jurisdictions continually                  using at-large elections, (3) a data base for all single-member                 and at-large districts identifying minority population size and                 electoral outcomes, and (4) a data base for a sample of all                     elected minority officials, identifying election type and other                 relevant characteristics of the jurisdiction.  Data will be                     gathered at the city, county, school board, and state legislative               level.  To facilitate comparative longitudinal analysis, data                   from different levels of government will be aggregated at the                   county level.                                                                        This major effort can be expected to produce equally major                 contributions.  At a theoretical level, the work holds                          substantial promise of adding to our understanding of the                       consequences of voting systems, the impact of law on social                     change, and the dynamics underlying implementation.  At a                       substantive level, this study will produce knowledge about race                 relations in America and one of the most important and far                      reaching federal laws to be enacted in the twentieth century.                   Further, beyond what will be accomplished by this team of                       investigators, the project will also yield a substantial data                   base appropriate for the analytic purposes of other scholars.",
