 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program is investigating the coastal effects of tsunamis          (seismic sea waves), including the inundation of coastal areas and the          interaction of overland flows with constructed facilities.                                                                                                      Most tsunamis are generated by sea floor uplift or underwater                   landslides resulting from an earthquake.  Unlike an earthquake, a               tsunami can cause severe damage and loss of life several thousand               miles from the source of the earthquake.  For example, Hilo, Hawaii             has been devastated by earthquakes occurring along the Aleutian chain           in Alaska, and along the subduction zone off the Chilean coast.  One            of the most devastating tsunamis experienced in Japan resulted from             the 1960 Chilean earthquake.  The magnitude (height) of tsunamis at             particular locations is difficult to predict, so that the actual                height may be much less than expected.  Also, the effect of a tsunami           of known height in causing damage to coastal structures is virtually            unknown.                                                                                                                                                        Most of the research undertaken has been for specific sites: little             generic research has been performed although these research topics are          basic to the understanding of the coastal effect of tsunamis.                   Professor Raichlen is investigating these subjects both analytically            and experimentally.  These pioneering                                           studies are expected to contribute significantly to the                         understanding of the coastal effect of tsunamis.",
