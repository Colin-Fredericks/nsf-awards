 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the variation in the chemical composition of              sea-floor volcanic rocks is important to understanding both the                 processes that produce the oceanic crust and origin of sea-floor                magmas in the mantle. Recent research has shown that the major                  and trace element chemistry can be controlled by both source                    differences as well as the extent of source melting and                         subsequent crystallization of the magma during its ascent to the                sea-floor. The isotopic composition of lead, neodymium and                      strontium, however, apparently reflects the original mantle                     source. By examining the complete chemistry of crustal rocks it                 should be possible to determine the importance of various mantle                sources in the crustal genesis.                                                         The objective of the present project is to complete lead,               neodynium and strontium isotope measurements on spreading center                basalts from the boundaries of the Nazca Plate in the eastern                   Pacific. Major and trace element analyses have already been                     completed on these samples. The major goal of the study is to                   determine the role that mantle hotspots have played in the break-               up of major crustal plates in the region. This complex history of               plate fragmentation has led to a number of transient microplates                during the last 30 million years. Samples to be studied are from                the Easter and Juan Fernandez Microplates and the Galapagos                     Spreading Center.                                                                       The principal investigator on this project is highly                    qualified to perform the research and is an authority on the                    isotope composition of crustal rocks.",
