 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is funded to study the relationship of micro-                     mechanics and the toughening mechanism of ceramics.  Many                       techniques have been tried to improve bonding between dissimilar                materials with applications to composite materials, layered                     electronic devices, and protective coatings.  Research will be                  conducted to study a number of aspects of fracture along interfaces             including the parameters controlling toughness of a brittle adherent            layer, the role of combined mode loading on debonding, and bond                 toughening by deflected crack trajectories within an adhesive layer.            Theoretical work will be carried out on micro-cracking and crack-               bridging, two basic mechanisms which can in principle be manipulated            by micro-structural processing to improve the toughness of                      polycrystalline ceramics.  The objective of this work is to quantify            the mechanisms so that reliable toughness predictions can be made               based on microstructural characterizations.  A basic study of                   cavitation in plastically deforming solids under triaxial stressing             will be conducted.  Stress levels at which \"explosive\" void growth              occurs will be sought.  These stress states represent intrinsic                 material stability limits which appear to have been attained in                 recent experiments under highly constrained flow.",
