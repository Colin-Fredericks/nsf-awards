 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the problem of interorganizational coordination         under the uncertain conditions of disaster.  The primary goal of the            research is to analyze the interactions of public managers with                 emergency responsibilities during the October 1, 1987 Whittier Narrows          earthquake in order to identify coordination and thereby increase the           efficiency of emergency operations.  The research addresses three basic         questions:                                                                      (1) How do the content and exchange of information affect the decision-         making capacity of public managers engaged in disaster operations?  (2)         What kinds of information are required by public managers to coordinate         actions of their respective organizations in a disaster situation?  and         (3) In what ways can information content and exchange be structured to          maximize adaptive performance within and between organization in a              disaster environment?  Sources of data will include interviews with             officials and archival data.",
