 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed that this project continue its research on                     the theoretical study of transport and other processes in metals                and alloys.  Five specific projects will be investigated.                                                                                                            1.  They will continue their investigation of transport in                 random substitutional alloys.  They will concentrate on                         understanding the dc electrical conductivity and thermopower in                 these materials.  They will also investigate other transport                    phenomena in random and disordered alloys.                                                                                                                           2.  They will study the relationships between the theory of                transport in random alloys (i.e. the theory that they are using                 for their calculations) and theory of so-called \"weak                           localization.\"  They will see if it is possible to merge these                  two theories.                                                                                                                                                        3.  They will study the phenomena of resistivity saturation                in which there is a maximum possible resistivity in a metal or                  alloy (the Mott theory).                                                                                                                                             4.  They will carry out calculations on the electronic                     properties of a model of an amorphous alloy (metallic glass).                                                                                                        5.  They will complete their theoretical investigation of                  radio-frequency-size effect in the metal cadmium.                                                                                                               They plan to carry out extensive calculations on the Illinois                   supercomputer.",
