 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a collaborative project between Clement (Texas A&M)                and Martinson (Columbia).  Preliminary results of paleomagnetic                 studies of sediments from ODP Sites 646 and 647 in the northwest                Atlantic indicate that these high sedimentation rate sections                   contain detailed records of the Cobb Mountain Subchronozone.                    Continuous sampling by Clement of the sediment from DSDP Hole 609B              has already yielded a very detailed record of this short, normal                polarity interval.  The PIs will sample the sediment from Holes                 646 and 647 in more detail and conduct a thorough paleomagnetic                 and rock magnetic study of these samples in an attempt to                       replicate the record obtained from Hole 609B.  They will                        quantitatively correlate the resultant vector time series                       components from each site to one another using the objective,                   nonlinear method of Martinson.  This will establish a statistical               foundation from which to evaluate the degree to which similarities              exist in the records.  This information will be used to examine                 the fidelity of deep-sea sediments as high resolution field                     recorders and the extent to which the differences in the records                may be explained as site dependent field behavior.",
