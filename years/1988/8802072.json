 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is mathematical research concerning smooth                    manifolds and certain differential operators associated with                    them.  A manifold is a surface (or higher-dimensional analog)                   with the commonsensical property that in the near vicinity of any               point, a coordinate system can be introduced that behaves like                  the ordinary system in two- (or n-) dimensional space.                          Differential operators can be defined in terms of these local                   coordinates.  Certain numbers that can be extracted from the                    operators tell us very interesting things about the underlying                  manifold.                                                                            Group representation theory comes into the picture when the                manifold is a symmetric space.  The noncommutative perspective                  afforded by recent developments in the theory of operator                       algebras is very helpful when the manifold carries some                         additional structure, such as a foliation with pathological leaf                space.  One specific objective of the project is to apply methods               of harmonic analysis on semisimple Lie groups to the study of eta               invariants and analytic torsion of locally symmetric manifolds                  with non-positive sectional curvature, aiming to express these                  invariants in terms of the geodesic flow.  Another aspect of the                work involves the Chern character and exponentially summable                    Fredholm modules in noncommutative differential geometry, with a                view towards applications to operator algebras associated with                  certain groups.",
