 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to improve the quality of under-               graduate laboratory experiences by equipping the organismal physiology          laboratories with computer-assisted data acquisition apparati.  Three           courses in the Biology Department (General Zoology, Human Anatomy and           Physiology, and Animal Physiology) will be directly affected.                                                                                                        Previously, physiological experimentation in the laboratory                sections of these courses was limited by inadequate equipment.  The             acquisition of computers, printers and appropriate hardware-software            packages greatly enhances the ability of students to gather and analyze         data.  Six Laser 128 computers with monitors and printers and four              software packages (Physiogrip, Spirocomp, Experiments in Human                  Physiology and Physio-graphic) constitute the suite of new equipment.           These programs allow both majors and non-majors to collect data with a          minimum of frustration, and introduce undergraduates to sophisticated           uses of computers in Biology.                                                                                                                                        The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
