 "awd_abstract_narration": "Language acquisition and retention among the Mississippi                Band of Choctaw Indians will be examined, and Mississippi State                 University and Choctaw students will be introduced to this area                 of linguistics through a) on-campus classes, seminars, and guest                lectures, and b) an off-campus, on-reservation field school.  The               research will provide a comparative base for the study of                       language shift employing data from Dr. Patricia Kwachka's recent                work in Alaskan Native communities.  Research in this area is                   practically nonexistent and offers major theoretical insights to                processes of human stability and change.                                                Dr. Kwachka's residence at Mississippi State University will            make available instruction and consultation in a scholarly area                 outside the capacity of their ordinary resources.  Through a                    lower division course, \"The Cultural Contexts of Language                       Learning,\" and through numerous guest lectures in introductory                  courses, she will reach women and other minorities before they                  disassociate themselves from higher education.  Most importantly,               the active participation of both the Choctaw tribe and                          Mississippi State University in this project offers a unique                    opportunity for theoretically significant, locally relevant,                    cooperative research and instruction.                                                   This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1)              to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                  engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF                  and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and                     engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists                and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic                    institutions.  By encouraging the participation of women in                     science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future                     scientific vitality.",
