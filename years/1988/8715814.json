Reasoning about knowledge,             which has long been of great interest to philosophers, has recently             been recognized to be of importance to many other fields, including             artificial intelligence, cryptography, distributed systems, economics,          and linguistics. The conference will be held at Asilomar (Pacific               Grove, California) on March 7-9, 1988.  As the first meeting, the               participants from several different disciplines will present recent             developments in contributed papers and invited papers.                                  The importance of this conference is its interdisciplinary              scope and the contribution it makes to building a theoretical base for          a wide variety of research in artificial intelligence and knowledge             based systems.",
