 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Peter                Abrams, University of Minnesota, and Dr. Ragnar Elmgren,                        Stockholm University.  They will study the effects of indirect                  interactions between pairs of species of bottom-dwelling                        invertebrates of the Baltic sea.  Indirect interactions occur                   through the mutual effects of two interacting species on a third                species.  The studies will involve laboratory experiments to                    measure short-term effects and mathematical modelling to                        estimate long-term changes in population densities.                                                                                                             It is important to understand indirect effects to be able to                    predict responses to changed conditions in natural species                      communities.  The effects are potential determiners of the                      abundance of species in a community.  One practical benefit of                  learning about indirect effects is being able to predict the                    consequences of perturbations to a community, such as from oil                  spills.  Experimental measurements have lagged behind theory                    about the effects because of the complexity of studying most                    natural communities.  The relative simplicity of the Baltic                     invertebrate community alleviates this problem and makes it                     possible to measure the effects.  The American and Swedish                      scientists have complementary skills to do the research.                        Dr. Abrams is a theoretical ecologist who has worked extensively                on indirect effects, and Dr. Elmgren is an experimentalist with                 broad experience studying interactions between Baltic                           invertebrates.",
