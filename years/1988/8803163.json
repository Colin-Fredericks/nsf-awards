 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although the process of ecological succession is considered                important in many communities, there has been a notable lack of                 experimental studies designed to test predictions of mechanistic                models.  The purpose of this study is to test for the importance                of noninteractive, facilitative and inhibitory models in benthic                algal succession in low order streams. Algal species colonizing                 initially barren clay tiles will be classified as early                         successional, late successional or successionally indifferent on                the basis of their relative abundance on the substrate through                  time.  The relative importance of facilitative, inhibitory and                  neutral interactions between early and late successional species                will be determined by comparing growth rates of species of each                 successional type under conditions where the density of early or                late successional species has been enhanced in the immigration                  pool.                                                                                These manipulations will be performed simultaneously in the                presence and absence of indigenous invertebrate grazers to assess               their importance.  Experiments will be performed in continuous-                 flow streamside channels which will allow for greater control of                confounding influences and replication of treatments.  The                      research will be the first to elucidate successional mechanisms                 by directly measuring effects of changes in the species                         composition of algal assemblages on species' growth rates and                   will help clarify future hypotheses regarding the importance of                 specific habitat parameters and grazing in influencing the rate                 and outcome of succession.",
