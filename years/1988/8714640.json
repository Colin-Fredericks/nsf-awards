 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to study the effects of electron               beam irradiation on contaminants of water to determine                          engineering design parameters for design of decontamination                     systems based on use of this concept.  This project involves use                of a 1.5 million volt electron accelerator with a beam current of               50 milliamperes located at the Miami-Dade Water and Sewer                       Authority's Wastewater Treatment Plant on Virginia Key in Miami,                Florida.  This accelerator was installed originally to obtain                   engineering design parameters for full-scale use of electron-beam               irradiation to disinfect sludges derived from treatment of                      wastewater.  Having served this purpose, it has become available                for use in conduct of additional research.                                                                                                                      An initial phase of this project includes detailed assessment of                the readiness-status of the accelerator and associated equipment,               design of potential modifications to meet this project's                        objective, and to conduct a workshop/conference to assist in                    modification of the research plan to take full advantage of                     recent advances in knowledge regarding the application of                       ionizing radiation for this and related purposes.  A system for                 decontamination of water supplies contaminated by organic                       substances could be responsive to the problem of widespread                     contamination of groundwater aquifers and surface water supplies                of the United States caused by improper management of hazardous                 wastes, leaking underground storage tanks  for petroleum products               and solvents, and accidental spills of chemicals in transit to                  users.  This unit that has been made available for conduct of                   research to the University of Miami and Florida International                   University offers a unique capability to operate an irradiation                 system at a sufficiently large scale to obtain data for                         engineering design of decontamination systems utilizing knowledge               gained through its operation and that of smaller, bench-scale                   sources of ionizing radiation.",
