 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary aim is the development of an economical synthesis                   of high temperature refractory materials such as titanium,                      silicon and aluminum nitrides through gas phase combustion                      processes that have sufficient energy release to sustain the                    formation of the refractories without the need for external                     heating.  Thermodynamic calculations performed for a variety                    of initial temperature and pressures have indicated that                        \"thermite\" types of reactions can generate high yields of                       refractory product.  An experiment in which a column of                         metallic sodium would be burned in a flowing atmosphere of                      nitrogen and gaseous metallic chloride will be used to verify                   if equilibrium thermodynamics do in fact determine the                          product distribution of the reactions.                                                                                                                          This one year award is to determine the overall process                         characterization as well as its potential for the economical                    manufacturing of ceramics.  If the preliminary experiments                      support the efficacy of these types of reactions, two                           implementation steps will be submitted for later NSF funding.                   First a sodium spray system would be built so that droplets                     of sodium could be reacted more efficiently in the flowing                      nitrogen and metallic chloride atmosphere.  An additional                       experiment that uses the stirred reactor conditions of a rocket                 engine to promote the heat feedback necessary for sustaining the                continuous chemical reaction of titanium and nitrogen alone and                 for increasing as well the refractory product yield economically                would be also proposed.",
