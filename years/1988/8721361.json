This will be the second                such workshop, following a first held at Stanford University in                 August 1984 in conjunction with the 8th World Conference on                     Earthquake Engineering (8WCEE).  This second workshop (2USJW)                   will be held in Shizuoka, just prior to the next World Conference               (9WCEE, 2-9 August 1988), and will focus on problems of                         earthquakes at the urban scale, examining in the context of                     mitigation efforts on-going in the US and Japan:                                                                                                                     1.
