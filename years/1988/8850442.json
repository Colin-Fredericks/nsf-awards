 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will improve the teaching of the biological                        sciences by involving teachers in the design and formulation                    of new teacher educational materials while, at the same time,                   providing them with authoritative and current background                        information in the biological sciences.                                                                                                                         The modules around which the program is organized were                          developed during previous summers in Institutes held at Merck                   and Co. in Rahway, New Jersey and the Waksman Institute at                      Rutgers University.  The modules consist of experimental                        laboratory based activities and supporting background                           information.                                                                                                                                                    A four-week summer institute will be held for 20 high school                    biology and biology/chemistry teachers from the New Jersey                      area.  A series of Background Seminars in science will be                       presented by university and industrial scientists to provide                    teachers with knowledge on the module topics.  These seminars                   will provide both an up-date on current research and the                        background science necessary for the teachers to maintain a                     good fundamental understanding of biology and biochemistry.                                                                                                     During the academic year the participating teachers will                        introduce the modules in their respective schools and present                   the modules to others teacher groups.                                                                                                                           Two kinds of follow-up actives will be conducted.  The first                    is a series of four meetings to be held during the academic                     year.  The second follow-up meeting will be a one-week                          institute to be held the following summer.                                                                                                                      This project is significant since it is a strong                                collaborative effort of University and industrial research                      scientists and high school teachers.  The projects allows the                   scientists to focus on the subject matter while the teachers                    provide expertise based upon their experience.                                                                                                                  Rutgers University has contributed an amount equal to 10% of                    the NSF award.",
