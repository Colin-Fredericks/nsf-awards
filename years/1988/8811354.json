 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is directed at understanding the nature of three                  transport processes of the intestine of lepidopteran insects for                potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate, and the role of these                     processes in the ionic and acid-base balance of the whole animal.               An important goal is to identify the processes by which the                     animal resists the potassium load presented by the plant diet and               the mechanisms of alkalinization of the contents in the anterior                parts and recovery of base in the posterior parts of the gut.                   The complexity of the tissue necessitates separation of the basal               and apical membranes and study of their transport mechanisms in                 isolation.  The immediate goals of this project are, first, to                  isolate the basal membrane components responsible for potassium                 entry by one of the following methods:  incorporation into lipid                bilayers, study in membrane vesicles, or patch-clamping of                      dissociated cells in primary culture.  Second, using similar                    techniques, possible chloride/bicarbonate exchange will be                      investigated in apical membranes of both columnar cells and                     goblet cells.  Third, the relationships between electrochemical                 driving forces and transport rates for both chloride and hydrogen               ions in isolated gut will be measured using ion-specific                        intracellular electrodes.  The effect of dietary potassium on                   acid-base, potassium, and chloride balances will also be measured               in the intact animal.                                                                                                                                           The results of these studies will provide information on the                    basic mechanisms by which insects regulate the ionic composition                and acid-base balance of their body fluids.  It will help to                    explain how butterfly and moth larvae are able to resist the load               of potassium provided by their diet of plant leaves.  New                       knowledge of the physiology of these transport systems may, in                  the future, suggest new approaches for the control of these                     insects.",
