Among the                   specific problems to be investigated are the following:  (1) A                  study of some allene rearrangements which appear parallel to                    (  ) ketone counterparts ( ), (2) a search for the mirror image                 process, where a (  ) excited is involved, (3) completion of                    the synthesis and study of bugatriyne, a bicyclic Mobius type                   of molecule with three acetylenic bridges, (4) synthesis and                    study of the hexa-yne relative of bugatriyne, (5) use of chiral                 quenchers to determine whether species along the reaction                       coordinate are subject to energy transfer, (6) continuation of                  our efforts on solid state photochemistry and means of                          controlling the solid state medium, (7) investigation of                        hypersurfaces for many of the reactions we have studied,                        including a comparison of the theoretical methods, (8)                          continuing our energy transfer studies using the rod-like                       molecules we have synthesized to ascertain if we really do have                 sigma exciton transfer, (9) utilization of bond-oriented basis                  set orbitals in SCF_CI calculations to give results meaningful                  to organic chemical studies, (10) testing of our ( ) treatment                  to our quantum mechanical results to assess energy localization                 and diffusion during photochemical reaction, (11) exploration                   of the \"Mechanism C\" triplet rearrangement of                                   vinylcyclopropenes to determine regioselectivity and to uncover                 the mechanisms of the diradical ring expansions, (12)                           determination of the mechanism of rearrangement of the                          acylcyclopropenes as well as imine and thione relatives, (13)                   investigation of the generality and sources of \"Exchange                        Integral Control\" of reaction multiplicity, (14) development of                 new photochemical concepts.",
