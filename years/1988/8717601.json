 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to understand both the physical and physiological                      function of a water soluble enzyme, the enzyme must be                          considered in the context of its environment.  This is true                     also for intrinsic membrane enzymes.  Drs. Melchior and                         Carruthers have demonstrated that the activity of a \"model\"                     membrane enzyme, the human erythrocyte sugar transporter, is                    a function of the lipid composition and physical state of the                   membrane in which it is embedded.  They have shown that just                    as features of the aqueous milieu of water soluble enzymes                      determine their activity, there are features of the lipid                       bilayer which determine the activity of intrinsic membrane                      enzymes.  Considerations of the behavior of membrane enzymes                    cannot be divorced from considerations of properties of their                   resident membrane bilayer.                                                                                                                                      The research will now be extended to elucidate the mechanisms                   by which bilayer lipids influence the activity of membrane                      enzymes.  Drs. Melchior and Carruthers  will determine the                      nature of those interactions of lipids with membrane proteins                   that alter enzyme activity.  They will continue to use as a                     model system the human erythrocyte sugar transporter                            molecule.  By the coordinated use of a variety of techniques                    for monitoring transporter function, transporter structure,                     bilayer structure and state, a unique understanding of the                      function of a membrane enzyme in the context of its bilayer                     environment will be obtained.",
