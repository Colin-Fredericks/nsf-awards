 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is directed toward using thermophilic bacteria to                 convert lignocellulosic materials into ethanol and other neutral                products.  Two tasks are considered, each based on original analyses            and/or concepts.  These tasks address critical factors which limit the          application of thermophilic solvent production, and are also expected           to contribute to fundamental understanding relevant to several topics           in biochemical engineering and applied microbiology and biochemistry.           The first task uses continuous pure cultures to investigate the                 influence of product manipulation on end product metabolism in order            to evaluate both the applied potential of this approach and also                theoretical models for metabolic regulation.  The second task extends           experimental and theoretical investigation of product manipulation to           undefined mixed cultures.                                                                                                                                       Biological conversion of lignocellulose to ethanol and other solvents           is a versatile process which could be used in various applications to           replace petroleum.  The amount of lignocellulose available in the U.S.          is much greater than the amounts of corn and other agricultural crops,          and is sufficiently large that transportation fuel requirements could           be met from this resource.  Thermophilic bacteria are attractive for            solvent production because they can ferment all of the carbohydrate             components in biomass.  This feature has a very favorable impact on             process economics, and distinguishes thermophiles from other                    biological agents which have been considered for solvent production.            This research addresses one of the main limitations of thermophiles             for solvent production:  The production of organic acids.  Biochemical          considerations suggest modifications of the fermentor environment to            favor solvent production, and bioreactor designs to achieve these               modifications.  Experiments to investigate effects of environmental             factors on solvent production will be carried out with both pure and            undefined mixed cultures.  The study of solvent production by                   undefined mixed cultures could result in a new process having many of           the advantages of anaerobic digestion but producing solvents in lieu            of less valuable methane.  Dilute-acid pretreated hardwood and xylose           will be the major substrates studied.",
