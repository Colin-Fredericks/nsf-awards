 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rochester Institute of Technology will operate a Faculty                   Development Workshop in Software Engineering for approximately 30               undergraduate faculty during the summer of 1988.  Its objectives                are (1) to broaden their awareness and understanding of software                engineering and (2) to provide a forum where issues related to                  undergraduate instruction in software engineering can be                        presented and discussed.  Workshop sessions will be conducted                   jointly by professors and industry participants.  Staff from the                Federally funded Software Engineering Institute will also                       participate.  Ample laboratory time will be available for                       attendees to gain direct experience with new software engineering               teaching and research tools.  A two and one-half year computer                  conference dedicated to undergraduate instruction in software                   engineering will begin immediately after the Workshop.  The                     significance of this project lies in the eventual increase in the               numbers of undergraduate students who are able to receive                       effective and contemporary instruction in a field of vital                      national interest.                                                                                                                                              In addition to the NSF funds, participants' institutions will                   contribute about 15% in travel costs to the operation of the                    project.",
