 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will determine the role of aerobic methane                 oxidation in carbon cycling in the Black Sea.  Experiments will                 include rate determinations as well as characterization of in                   situ populations.                                                                       Determinations of methane oxidation rates will be carried               out as follows.  Samples will be taken throughout the water                     column, and a methane profile will be generated.  Previous work                 suggests that a break in the profile should occur at or near                    the oxic/anoxic interface.  The methane oxidation rate across                   the break in the profile will be estimated using 14CH4, to                      determine the site of peak activities.  Samples from this depth                 will then be used in kinetic studies to determine Vm and Km                     parameters for methane.  This information will be used to                       estimate in situ methane oxidation rates across the zone of                     maximum activity.  The data will then be compared to data                       generated by other groups concerning carbon cycling in this                     environment.                                                                            In situ populations will be characterized as follows.                   Antigenic and electron microscopic methods currently being                      developed, will be applied to samples from the zone of maximum                  activity to obtain relative distributions of the different                      classes of methanotrophs.  Samples from the same locations will                 be used to set up both batch and chemostat enrichments, and                     aerobic methanotrophs will be isolated and characterized.                       These isolates will be compared to existing strains as well as                  the in situ populations.",
