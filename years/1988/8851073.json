This study will be conducted to determine characteristics        of the learner and informal mathematics learning experiences; examine           the viewing experience over a four- to six-week period to understand the        context in which informal mathematics learning occurs; determine program        characteristics which facilitate positive thinking about mathematics;           and reveal affective and cognitive outcomes from viewing including              participation in activities while viewing, follow-up activities which           result from viewing, and change in perceptions about and attitudes              toward mathematics.  One-on-one in-home interviews will be conducted on         a pre- and post-test basis over a four- to six-week period with 600             child-parent pairs. Children from age 4 to 12 and one of their parents          will be interviewed.  Intermediary telephone interviews will permit             careful tracking of actual viewing time and of what happens during              viewing.  Three conditions for informal learning will exist between the         pre- and post-test.  Two hundred child viewers will have no                     encouragement to view, another 200 will be encouraged to view a                 designated amount of television in the time slot when Square One TV             airs, and a final 200  will be encouraged to view Square One TV on a            regular basis.  Outcomes of the study will be increased understanding of        informal mathematics learning, refinement of a model for informal               learning, and directions for research in this area.",
