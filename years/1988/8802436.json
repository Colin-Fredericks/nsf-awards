 "awd_abstract_narration": "A vision machine must support a wide range of complex operations           on massive amounts of time-varying image data, and execute all of the           operations at high speeds.  The goal of this research is to design,             implement, and evaluate dynamic, cooperative, parallel vision                   algorithms which execute simultaneously on two tightly-coupled                  multiprocessors: a linearly-connected, 8-processor Aspex PIPE, and a            10-processor, shared-memory Sequent Balance.  This two-level                    organization corresponds to the two kinds of processing required in             computer vision.  In the first, low-level vision algorithms will be             developed for the PIPE, detecting primitive \"tokens\" in a video-rate            sequence of images.  The second, high-level vision, requires more               symbolic and geometric processing (e.g., in model-based object                  recognition), and will be developed for the Sequent.  Research                  activities will include the development of methods for coordinating             multiple levels of image analysis on the two machines, dynamic load-            balancing techniques for high-level vision on the shared-memory                 multiprocessor, and parallel algorithms for multiresolution image               analysis and model-based recognition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             //",
