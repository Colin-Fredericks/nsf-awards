 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many empirical studies demonstrate that parents can                     influence offspring appearance (phenotype) beyond the effects of                nuclear chromosomes that parents contribute to offspring.  For                  example, ecological and genetic studies have shown that the                     physical environment in which the parents are grown can affect                  offspring growth and reproduction.  Likewise independent of                     environment, parents can transmit extra-nuclear DNA to offspring;               this DNA can also influence growth and reproduction.  Lacey's                   study will further characterize these parental effects (defined                 as these non-nuclear contributions that parents make to offspring               phenotype), and also provide information about the role of these                effects in natural and artificial selection.                                            The research will focus on the effects of parental flowering            time on offspring phenotype in Plantago lanceolata, an herbaceous               weed of agricultural fields and other disturbed habitat.                        Flowering time effects will be examined directly.  Also, because                flowering time effects are probably mediated through temperature                change during flowing and seed maturation, Lacey will examine how               temperature affects offspring phenotype.  Genetically different                 parents will be cloned and then grown and crossed under different               combinations of temperatures and at different flowering times                   outdoors.  Offspring of the crosses will then be grown and traits               measured.  The traits that will be measured determine an                        individual's fitness in a natural or evolutionary context and                   yield in an agricultural context.                                                       Because yield will be measured, the research will provide               information that will be useful to crop breeders.  Maximizing                   yield (a goal of crop breeders) necessitates knowing whether                    flowering time and temperature in one generation influence yield                in the next and, if they do, what yield components are affected.                For example; if parental flowering time, which is partially                     genetically controlled, is found to influence offspring yield,                  then breeders should be able to improve yield in a generation of                commercial importance by altering flowering time or temperature                 in the previous generation.  Lacey's project will provide                       information about the potential use of parental effects in crop                 breeding programs.",
