 "awd_abstract_narration": "Future technological needs for ceramics will be great.  A                  great deal of research in advanced ceramics is necessary now so                 that its potential for unique structural, electronic, and optical               properties will be available to develop the crucial new industrial              processes and products necessary for continued industrial growth.               Industry has recognized this need and appears to be willing to                  support an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for                  Micro-Engineered Ceramics.                                                           This project is funding the initiation of an                               Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Micro-                      Engineered Ceramics at the University of New Mexico in                          collaboration with New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology                and in association with Sandia and Los Alamos National                          Laboratories.  The research program is addressing:                                   1.  Novel powder processing schemes for controlled morphology                       powder compacts;                                                            2.  Coatings and porous films; and                                              3.  Heavy particle modification of ceramics and effects on                          thermal and electronic properties.                                          Industry funding will exceed $300,000 per year.  In addition               to the National Science Foundation, the two National Laboratories               are committing $500,000 per year to the Center.  In addition to a               complete return of overhead on industrial funds to the Center, the              University of New Mexico has committed $800,000 in start-up                     funding for new personnel and other long-term investments for the               infrastructure of the Center.  New Mexico Institute of Mining and               Technology is contributing two graduate students to the Center.                      The Principal Investigator and his university and National                 Laboratory research colleagues in the Center are nationally                     recognized experts in their fields.  They represent a very strong               research team that has the capability and industrial contacts to                establish and run an Industry/University Cooperative Research                   Center.                                                                              The Program Manager recommends that a cooperative agreement                be made with the University of New Mexico in collaboration with                 New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology.  Total funding for               the cooperative agreement is not to exceed $750,000 over five                   years.",
