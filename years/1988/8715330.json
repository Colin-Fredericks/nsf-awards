 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal objectives of the research program are to explore                 those aspects of the environment of luminous quasi-stellar ob-                  jects (QSOs) and powerful radio galaxies that seem most likely to               give insights into the physical mechanisms responsible for the                  production of the active nucleus in these objects.  Five specific               research projects will be carried out:                                                                                                                          1. An intensive imaging and spectroscopic study of a small sample               of steep-radio-spectrum QSOs designed specifically to under-                    stand the correlation between the presence of extended                          ionized gas and other observed properties.                                                                                                                      2. A similar study of three or four broad-spectral-line radio                   galaxies showing extensive extended ionized gas.                                                                                                                3. A survey to detect extended emission-line regions around                     intermediate-redshift (greater than 0.6 and less than 0.9)                      QSOs in order to study the evolutionary history of this                         phenomenon.                                                                                                                                                     4. A continuation of a deep-imaging survey of a complete sample                 of Third Cambridge Radio Survey (3CR) galaxies and QSOs with                    redshifts between 0.8 and 1.3 to explore correlations between                   the strength and distribution of the extended emission-line                     radiation and the continuum distribution and color (for the                     radio galaxies) and the radio structure.                                                                                                                        5. A systematic and thorough imaging and spectroscopic investiga-               tion of Cygnus A which will provide data that will result in                    intensity-ratio maps for diagnostic emission lines and give a                   better understanding of the kinematics of the stars and gas.",
