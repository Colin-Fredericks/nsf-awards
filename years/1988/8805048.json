 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ATP synthase of mitochondria, chloroplasts and bacteria                     taps the energy of a transmembrane proton gradient to                           synthesize ATP.  The mechanism of this important energy-                        conserving process is not understood in molecular terms.                        The enzyme is comprised of two portions, F0, which is an                        integral, membrane-spanning proton channel, and F1 which is                     peripheral to the membrane and contains the catalytic sites.                    Together F0 and F1 contain more than eight different protein                    subunits with a minimum of seventeen polypeptide chains.                        Three of the F1 subunits have been isolated in                                  reconstitutively active forms from the chloroplast enzyme                       (CF1), and attempts to isolate the remaining two for use in                     reconstitution studies aimed at elucidating subunit                             structure-function relationships will be under taken.  Other                    studies will aim at obtaining structural information for the                    B subunit which contains part or all of the catalytic site.                     Chemical modification with fluorescent and photoaffinity                        probes will be employed to map specific sites on the B                          subunit within the CF1 complex and to identify amino acid                       residues involved in, for example, nucleotide binding.                          Monoclonal antibodies will be used to identify sites of                         contact between the B subunit and other subunits of the ATP                     synthase.                                                                                                                                                       When plants capture sunlight they convert the radiant energy                    into chemical energy which supports the synthesis of plant                      constituents.  The latter provide, directly or indirectly,                      the nutrients of animals, including man.  The energy                            conversion process is complex and is catalyzed by a set of                      proteins in the chloroplast membrane.  Several of these have                    been isolated and the PI wishes to isolate and characterize                     others so that eventually the whole complex can be                              reconstituted in a functional form.",
