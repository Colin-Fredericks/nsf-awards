 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Three-Dimensional Solid Design Space is an advanced                    design workstation for three-dimensional geometric modeling                     applications, composed of a host computer, a three-dimensional                  stereoscopic display system, and a state-of-the-art input device                capable of sensing the position and orientation of each of the                  user's fingers.  The Design Space smoothly varying complex                      surface shapes such as car bodies, airplane fuselages, and                      telephone casings.  To support this type of design, a surface                   representation scheme must be found that is capable of describing               either first or second order smooth shapes of arbitrary topology;               the surface scheme should be efficiently computable and support                 successive refinement design.  Unfortunately, existing surface                  representation schemes fail to meet these standards.                                 This research deals with the development of new schemes                    that possess the characteristics listed above.  Such surface                    schemes will not only enjoy use in interactive three-                           dimensional design, they will also find important applications                  in a variety of data fitting problems.",
