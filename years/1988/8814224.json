There has been active research in Symbolic and Algebraic Computation            (SAC) since at least the early 1960's by a small group of researchers           world-wide.  This research has resulted in substantially improved               algorithms for some fundamentally important problems such as polynomial         gcd calculation, in the development of early generation of software and         in a few significant applications.  The research to date has revealed a         substantial potential for this kind of computation, but the potential           remains largely unrealized and the research area is still in an                 immature state.  It is the purpose of this workshop to bring together a         group of eminent scientists and engineers from a wide variety of                backgrounds to examine and see what action, if any, is desirable to             accelerate research in this area.  The conclusions reached by the               participants will be documented in a report.  The report will include           an assessment of the current status of research in this area, outline           and justify near-term and long-term goals, and make recommendations to          federal agencies, especially the National Science Foundation, for               action to meet these goals.",
