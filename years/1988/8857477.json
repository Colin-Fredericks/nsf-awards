 "awd_abstract_narration": "A project has been developed which is concerned with the                        dispersion of particles in a turbulent shear flow.  Single                      particles of variable size shall be injected onto the center-line               of a turbulent jet; laser light scattering will be used to                      measure the position of the particle across a plane of the jet.                 It is intended that Lagrangian statistics of particle dispersion                be obtained as a function of the relative time scales for                       particle motion and for turbulence.  A second project is being                  developed to study the effect of mixing rates on turbulent                      diffusion flames which are confined in a duct.  In particular,                  the formation of soot and its radiation are of interest in                      confined diffusion flames.  As the axial pressure gradient is                   increased, mixing rates are enhanced and the formation of soot                  particles may be suppressed.  Measurements of soot volume                       fraction and velocities will be made in these flows.                                                                                                            A third area of interest is in particle formation in mixing                     flows.  This work is related to condensation in mixing layers,                  aerosol nucleation kinetics and possibly material synthesis in                  flames.  A numerical study is being performed on the effect of                  mixing on a condensational aerosol in a mixing layer.  An                       experiment is planned in which laminar flows containing trace                   amounts of ammonia and hydrogen chloride form particles via a                   relatively slow reaction.",
