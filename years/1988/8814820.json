N. Stewart, Mathematics             Institute, University of Warwick, Coventry, England.                                                                                                            The mathematics required for the understanding of nonlinear                     problems has undergone an enormous development in the past twenty               years.  A key ingredient in this progress has been the introduction             of the ideas and techniques of singularity theory in analyzing                  nonlinear problems in various areas of mathematics, as well as                  physics and chemistry.  In recognition of this development, the                 Mathematical Institute of the University of Warwick is sponsoring,              during the 1988-89 academic year, a special year on \"Singularity                Theory and Bifurcation Theory\".                                                                                                                                 Dr. Damon is a leading researcher in the important area of analysis             of singularities of mappings.  This award will allow Dr. Damon to               spend the 1988-1989 academic year at the University of Warwick,                 carrying out collaborative work on topological properties of                    bifurcation problems, finite map germs and nonlinear problems.",
