Appleby, S. Srinivasan and O.J. Murphy at                           Texas A&M University, aided by R.B. Schwarz and A.                              Redondo of Los Alamos National Laboratory, and W.E.                             Triaca and C. Giordana of the National University of                            La Plata in Argentina.  In addition, the                                        U.S.-Argentina cooperation will be extended to a                                trilateral effort with Brazil by including E.R.                                 Gonzalez and L.A. Avaca at the University of Sao                                Paulo.  Together, they will investigate the effects of                          crystalline orientation and morphology on the                                   electrocatalysis of fuel cell reactions.  The work                              will focus on oriented surfaces of platinum as an                               electrocatalyst for aqueous electrolyte and solid                               polymer electrolyte fuel cells.  Amorphous metallic                             alloys, a new class of materials with promise as                                stable catalysts will be prepared and characterized                             and electrode kinetics will be investigated.                                                                                                                    A multidisciplinary approach to this work is required,                          including electrochemistry, surface science, materials                          science and theoretical chemistry.  At Texas A&M,                               special high-vacuum systems will be used to synthesize                          the materials, while the electrochemical studies will                           be pursued in both Argentina and Brazil.  In this way                           the facilities and personnel of all three institutions                          will contribute to this truly collaborative project.",
