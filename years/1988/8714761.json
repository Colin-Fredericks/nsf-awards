 "awd_abstract_narration": "A study will be made of the mechanisms that regulate expression                 of the nitrogen fixation (nif) genes of the enteric bacterium K.                pneumoniae.  Emphasis will be place on an in vitro study of the                 protein product of the nifA gene (designated NIFA), which is                    required to activate transcription of the nif operons.  The goal                will be to determine the mechanism by which NIFA activates                      transcription.  An assay for the activity of NIFA in crude                      preparations will be developed based on its ability to stimulate                expression from the nifHDK promoter (the promoter for the                       structural operon encoding nitrogenase and nitrogenase reductase)               in a coupled in vitro transcription-translation system.  This                   assay will be used to purify the NIFA protein.  NIFA activity                   will be characterized in a transcription system and as a DNA-                   binding protein.  Genetic evidence suggests that NIFA is                        synthesized in an active form-that is, a form which stimulates                  expression of the nif operons-but that it can be inactivated by                 the product of gene nifL (NIFL) in response to the presence of                  fixed nitrogen or oxygen. Once purified, an attempt will be made                to demonstrate inactivation of NIFA by NIFL in vitro and to                     determine the basis for this inactivation.                                                                                                                      Ammonia is the preferred source of nitrogen for most                            microorganisms.  When grown in the absence of ammonia or other                  preferred sources, bacteria like K.  pneumoniae develop the                     ability to obtain utilize atmospheric nitrogen (nitrogen                        fixation).  The enzymes that catalyze this process are encoded by               a cluster of genes known as the nif system.  This project will                  examine the mechanism by which the nif genes are activated.                     Emphasis will be placed on characterizing the protein product of                a gene within the nif cluster (nifA) whose expression is                        essential for activation of the other nif genes.  This study will               shed light on the critical regulatory events that allow bacteria                to convert atmospheric nitrogen into biologically useful forms.",
