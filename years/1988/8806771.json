 "awd_abstract_narration": "The only cytosine methylase in Escherichia coli K-12, called                    Dcm, recognizes the sequence 5'-CC(A/T)GG-3' and transfers a                    methyl group to position 5 of the second cytosine.  It appears                  also to be involved in a DNA repair process called vary short                   patch (VSP) repair.  This process corrects T/G mismatches at                    potential sites of recognition for Dcm to C/G.  It is believed                  to have evolved to eliminate potential mutagenic effects of the                 deamination of 5-methyl cytosine to thymine.                                                                                                                    Dr. Bhagwat will explore the role of Dcm in this repair process                 by means of biochemical and genetic tools.  He will try to                      answer three basic questions (1) Does Dcm bind separate from                    those involved in DNA methylation?  (3) Are there other                         proteins in the process that genetically closely linked with                    Dcm?  Specifically, he will determine the sequence of the gene                  for Dcm (dcm) and purify its product.   He will delineate the                   region within the clones carrying dcm gene that is essential                    for VSP repair and determine if it carries any genes other than                 dcm.  He will also map regions within dcm required for such                     repair and correlate them with regions believed to be involved                  in DNA methylation.  Finally, he will test the purified Dcm for                 binding to synthetic DNA substrates containing mismatches that                  resemble authentic substrates for VSP repair.                                                                                                                   Errors often occur in the replication of DNA when cells divide                  to form daughter cells.  Cells contain machinery for the repair                 of these mistakes so that the occurrence of harmful mutations                   which would otherwise occur are lessened.  One of the systems                   for this purpose is the \"very short patch\" repair system which                  the proposer is investigating with both genetic and biochemical                 approaches.",
