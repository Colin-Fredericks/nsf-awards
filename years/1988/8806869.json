 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many theories have been advanced recently for actively controlling              flexible mechanical systems.  However, experimental verification of             these methods has not kept pace with the theoretical development.               This project provides for equipment to evaluate some of the                     theoretical work and hopefully to identify new research directions in           the area of control/structure interaction.  The equipment comprises             two components; an Integrated Systems Incorporated (ISI) MAX 100 and            a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) VAXStation II.  Together, they            form a real time digital controller, a data acquisition system, as              well as a powerful computing resource.  Four projects have been                 identified which can benefit from use of the equipment.  The first              deals with control-structure-actuator interaction where the intent is           to understand the effect of the dynamics of the actuators themselves            on the entire system.  A second project deals with design of                    spacecraft controllers consistent with the low total energy budget of           the spacecraft system.  A third project develops methods for testing            the accuracy of a large class of existing multibody simulation tools.           The fourth project focuses on testing theoretical models developed              for advanced structural composite materials.",
