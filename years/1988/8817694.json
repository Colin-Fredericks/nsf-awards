The purpose of the National Information Service for Earthquake                  Engineering is to disseminate information on earthquake                         engineering and allied fields to practicing engineers and related               professionals, academic researchers, government agencies and                    the general public.  The program provides a central collection                  point for reports on NSF-sponsored research as well as other                    developments in earthquake engineering.  The NISEE program                      at the Earthquake Engineering Research Center, University of                    California, Berkeley, includes the EERC Library, Earthquake                     Engineering Abstracts and Computer Applications.  During the                    last two year grant cycle, the EERC Library acquisitions and                    public service transactions continued to increase.  Earthquake                  Engineering Abstracts developed two new services, CAUS-                         Current Abstract Update Service and CCIS-Customized Current                     Information Service, to improve the utility of its services.                    Computer Applications continued its distribution of                             microcomputer and mainframe computer software at its annual                     level of recent years.                                                                                                                                          NISEE will continue to take advantage of new information                        handling technology to increase the efficiency of current                       operations, to broaden the spectrum of service provided and to                  expand the audience served.  Plans include expansion of CAUS                    and CCIS services and conversion of all volumes of the                          Abstract Journal into electronic media using optical character                  recognition equipment.  The EERC Library will join OCLC and                     convert existing records into library standard format.                          Computer Applications will expand its microcomputer software                    library by converting programs for operation on the PC.",
