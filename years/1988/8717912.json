 "awd_abstract_narration": "Models of extragalactic radio jets will be constructed using a                  variety of numerical approaches.  An essentially                                three-dimensional boundary-following code will be used to                       continue to investigate the formation and evolution of radio                    jets.  In particular, the bending of jets by ram pressure as the                central galactic source moves through an external medium, the                   growth of non-axisymmetric instabilities, and the effects of a                  precessing source of jet fluid, will all be studied.                                                                                                            Recently developed analytic models of jet propagation from a                    galactic halo across a pressure-matched interface into an                       extremely hot intergalactic medium will be developed further.                   Preliminary calculations using this idea seem to provide good                   explanations for both the current average size of strong radio                  sources and the fact the such sources were significantly samller                at earlier cosmological epochs.  Numerical models of this                       situation will be developed using both the three-dimensional                    boundary following code and a full two-dimensional hydrodynamics                code and more detailed comparisons with statistical data will be                made.                                                                                                                                                           Analytic models for jet instabilities will be applied to Very                   Large Array (VLA) radio maps of a particularly interesting radio                source with a single, oscillatory jet feeding into a diffuse                    lobe.                                                                                                                                                           A general model for the continuum electromagnetic emission from                 active galactic nuclei, based on coherent plasma processes, will                be further developed and compared with observations.",
