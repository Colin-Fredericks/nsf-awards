 "awd_abstract_narration": "It was once thought that we could \"objectively\" observe and                     analyze other cultures and societies and draw clear conclusions                 about their nature and structure.  With the revolution which has                occurred in the philosophy of science in which \"objectivity\" is                 even denied to physical sciences, the possibility of an                         \"objective\" social science is now seen as beyond reach.                         Ethnographic studies are now recognized as a more or less                       subjective observation of a foreign culture as seen through a                   prism the observer's own culture, life experience and training.                 In this study, Dr. Mark is continuing her examination of                        ethnographic studies of the Mbuti pygmies of the Ituri Forest of                Zaire.  Specifically she is concentrating on the life and work of               one of these observers, P.T.L. Putnam (1904-1953) and two of his                contemporaries, Paul Schebesta and Colin Turnbull.  The study is                based on Dr. Mark's examination of Putnam's personal papers and                 field notes, on interviews with people who knew him, and on                     extensive library research.  She will use this detailed                         examination of Putnam in order to compare his work with that of                 Schebesta and Turnbull.  Through this comparison she will then be               able to examine how differing national traditions in                            anthropology, differing ethnographic goals, and differing                       personal quests affect fieldwork and the writing of                             ethnographies.  This study promises to make significant                         contributions to the history of anthropology, to our                            understanding of the nature of ethnography, and to the sociology                of knowledge in general.",
