 "awd_abstract_narration": "A single-cylinder research engine will be instrumented for                      measurements of instantaneous wall surface temperatures, convective             and radiative heat fluxes, combustion chamber pressure and other                pertinent flow-field parameters, and exhaust emissions.  The results            will be used to develop a new generation of multi-dimensional process           models which will be suitable for realistic simulation of Low-Heat              Rejection (LHR) and conventional engines using available                        supercomputers.  The basis for these models will be the Los Alamos              Kiva-II program which can provide a detailed knowledge of in-cylinder           fluid and combustion processes.  Improved gas-to-wall heat transfer             models will relate boundary layer phenomena to turbulence and                   combustion processes and in-cylinder radiation to soot dynamics.                Multi-dimensional finite element descriptions of the combustion                 chamber components will also be incorporated into the code.  Thus,              cyclically-varying gas-to-wall heat transfer phenomena, transient heat          conduction inside the components, unsteady boundary layer and deposit           characteristics, and engine combustion and emissions phenomena will be          studied.                                                                                                                                                        The proposed engine heat transfer and combustion studies will enhance           our basic understanding of the unsteady thermal phenomena in                    conventional and LHR engine combustion chambers.  This new knowledge            will be used to optimize the performance and emissions trade-offs               resulting from the introduction of ceramic materials, advanced                  component designs, and new fuels and lubricants in the engine                   combustion chamber.  The experimental studies will also provide                 realistic boundary conditions which will be used in our analytical              models to predict transient temperature distributions, thermal stress           levels, and lubrication requirements of conventional and LHR                    combustion chamber components.  This coordinated research effort which          takes advantage of advanced instrumentation and ever-increasing                 computer capability can make a substantial contribution in our efforts          to produce more fuel efficient engines with acceptable emissions                characteristics.",
