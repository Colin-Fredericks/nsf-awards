 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a are pharmacologically active peptides                derived from the third and fifth components of serum complement.                When administered focally to the rat hypothalamus, they mimic the               neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine in their respective               abilities to modify standard behavioral tests.  There are                       specific binding sites for both peptides on fresh brain slices                  and for C3a on synaptosome fractions (nerve terminal fractions                  in vitro).  C5a has been shown to stimulate the release of both                 dopamine and norepinephrine from synaptosomes.  Preliminary data                obtained by high performance liquid chromatography indicate that                C3a releases dopamine from synaptosomes of the striatal region of               the forebrain.  Dr. William's data are the first report of                      activities of the anaphylatoxins in the central nervous system.                 Further study of these phenomena may reveal their possible                      modulatory function in the brain.  There are two main objectives                in Dr. William's proposed studies.  The first objective is to                   characterize the locations and mechanisms of neurotransmitter                   releasing activity in the brain.  The release of neurotransmitter               substances in vitro in the presence of blockers for calcium                     channels, GTP binding proteins and autoreceptors. The second                    objective is to associate the brain binding sites with specific                 nerve terminal types by immunocytochemistry and transmission                    electron microscopy.",
