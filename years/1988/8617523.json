 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative grant permits Drs. Sabloff and Tourtellot to                 continue their archaeological research at the site of Sayil,                    located in the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico.  It follows on the                  season of preliminary reconnaissance and two seasons of field                   work which have produced a detailed map of the site.  In this                   next phase, the investigators will conduct both deep                            stratigraphic tests and extensive but shallow excavations.  These               latter will serve to verify the surface for evidence of buried                  features or additional feature types.  The excavations will also                allow the recovery of cultural material such as ceramics which                  will permit the purpose of each feature type to be determined.                  This site dates to only a relatively brief period or if                         occupation was longer than expected.  It will also allow                        community size and organization to be determined.                                                                                                               The archaeological sites of the Puuc Hills region of northern                   Yucatan, where Sayil is located played a crucial role in the                    development of ancient Maya civilization between the late Eighth                Century and the early Eleventh Century, A.D., but our knowledge                 of these sites is surprisingly limited.  There has never been an                intensive full scale settlement pattern study of an individual                  site.  However, since this region played a crucial role in the                  history of the Maya, it is well worth conducting such work.                                                                                                     This research is important because it will increase our                         understanding of the origin and maintenance of complex societies                such as our own.  Because of the excellent collaboration with                   Mexican scientists, it will also help to develop close ties with                this archaeological establishment.  I recommend support.",
