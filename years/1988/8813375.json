 "awd_abstract_narration": "All mammals share a fundamental energy-related concern: once               the initial costs of obtaining and assimilating food energy have                been accomplished, then remaining surplus energy must be                        allocated parsimoniously among a variety of competing                           physiological and behavioral demands.  Obtaining food to meet                   survival demands is a core energetic constraint to which most                   other dimensions of development, such as growth and especially                  reproduction, must be subservient.  Because of the disparate                    demands of reproduction between the two sexes, they can often be                conceptually treated as separate species.  It is therefore not                  surprising that males and females of certain species have evolved               markedly different priorities for energy allocation.  Dr. Glenn                 Perrigo is making use of the mouse as an experimental model to                  investigate differences in energy allocation strategies between                 males and females.  His work will examine organizational and                    activational effects of early gonadal hormones on sex                           differences.  He will also study effects of maternal stress on                  the fetal hormone milieu of offspring whose mothers are subject                 to rigorous foraging conditions during pregnancy.  This work                    should give us more information on how gonadal hormones effect                  differences in energy allocation in mammals.",
