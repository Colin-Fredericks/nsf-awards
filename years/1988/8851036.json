The junior and senior high school students will come from The                   Science Academy of Austin, a unit of the Austin (TX)                            Independent School District sponsored by the District and a                     consortium of local industries.  They will work with teachers                   at both levels to develop science teaching units that they                      can present at the elementary level, both in person and                         via videotape, thereby serving as role models.  They will                       also serve as mentors to sixth grade students who visit the                     Science Academy.  The Science Academy will also work directly                   with elementary teachers in teacher enhancement programs and                    will actively seek to interest minority and female elementary                   students to apply for the Science Academy.                                                                                                                      Cost sharing by the partners is estimated to total at least                     75% of the NSF funding.",
