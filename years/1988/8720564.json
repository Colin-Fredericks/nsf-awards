 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an isotopic investigation of the age and origin                 of processes operating in the Cameroon Line, a 1600 km. long                    chain of 70 to 30 million year old plutons, and 30 to 0 million                 year old volcanoes which is virtually unique among intraplate                   basalt provinces in traversing both oceanic and continental                     lithosphere.  Recent work has shown that 1) the basalts have                    identical chemistry in oceanic and continental sectors, 2)                      phonolites are common in the oceanic but rare in the continental                sector, 3) rhyolites are common in the continental sector but                   absent from the oceanic sector, 4) amphibole is abundant in the                 oceanic sector but scarce in the continental sector, 5) the                     basaltic lavas display a progression to more radiogenic Pb with                 time in both oceanic and continental sectors, 6) there is a                     remarkable lead isotopic anomaly at the continent/ocean boundary                in that the volcanics immediately to either side have a uniform,                highly radiogenic signature ragardless of lad concentration.                    A comprehensive Rb-Sr and 40AR-39Ar dating study of the plutons                 and volcanic centers will be conducted to provide critical                      information to test kinematic models for the origin of the                      Cameroon Line and provide a framework for petrological                          investigations.  Detailed Nd, Sr, Pb, O, H and He isotopic                      studies of long lived volcanic centers, the plutonic centers and                mantle nodules will be conducted.  This should shed light on how                mantle sources change with time and provide tests to some current               models for the generation of intraplate magmas.",
