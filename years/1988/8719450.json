 "awd_abstract_narration": "Exploration is a very basic, conspicuous and biologically                       important behavior of mammals.  At the same time, it is complex                 and involves important experiential and developmental parameters.               Dr. Renner's research project consists of several investigations                designed to provide detailed descriptive information about the                  spontaneous exploratory behavior of rats.  This objective will be               accomplished by recording videotapes of rat exploration, followed               by transcription of these recordings using existing methods for                 measuring exploratory behavior, as well as by applying for the                  first time a standardized movement.notation technique to the                    analysis of interactions with inanimate objects.                                                                                                                Such an account, if available, could be used as benchmark data                  for several types of studies, including investigations into the                 functional significance of spontaneous exploration, research on                 its relationship to other behaviors related to learning and                     information.processing, and the study of the biological                         mechanisms controlling these behaviors.",
