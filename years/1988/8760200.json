 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in remote calibrations of electrical measurements and remote           identification of defective instruments is proposed in response to the          electric power industry's need for an efficient and less costly                 methodology. Power system reliability and economy of operation                  requires accurate measurements of current, voltage, real and reactive           power.  Typically, the number of measurements is in the thousands.              The primary sensors, transducers, and other instruments in the                  measurement streams are subject to drift and deterioration with time,           temperature and environment.  They need periodic inspections and                calibrations.                                                                   The proposed research would attempt to replace the present procedure            where individual instruments, rather than the resulting measurements,           are periodically inspected and calibrated on locations by field                 calibrating equipment, a process which is:  labor intensive, untimely,          introduces its own errors, and interferes with normal operation of the          power system.                                                                   The proposed research has the potential of remotely identifying                 defective instruments and remotely calibrating measurements, thus               drastically reducing the effort required in the periodic inspection of          several thousands of instruments spread over a wide area, and                   significantly improving the quality of measurements needed for power            system operation.",
