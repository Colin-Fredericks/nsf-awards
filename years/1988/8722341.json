 "awd_abstract_narration": "Supramolecular assemblies, such as monolayers, vesicles,                        bilayers, and tubules, are two-dimensional arrays of amphiphiles.               The recent introduction of methods to polymerize these assemblies               provides a means to modify their chemical and physical                          properties.  The nature of these two-dimensional polymerizations                and the effect of the assembly structure on the polymerization                  reaction are poorly understood.                                                                                                                                 The objective of this research is to enhance the understanding of               the fundamentals of two-dimensional polymerizations.                            Specifically, this initial research will emphasize the following:               a) the factors that control the size of linear polymers formed                  from assemblies of homolipid assemblies; b) the rate of two-                    dimensional polymerization in homo- and mixed-lipid assemblies;                 and c) evaluation of the effect of the frequency of crosslinks in               the polymerization of the assemblies on both the rate of lipid                  diffusion, and the solvent stability of the polymerized                         assembly.  These data, to be determined primarily for extended                  bilayer, cast bilayer, and vesicle assemblies, are expected to                  provide a basis to evaluate how two-dimensional polymerizations                 parallel or deviate from the established principles of isotropic                polymerizations.  Consequently, they will provide a basis for                   the use of two-dimensional polymerizations for the formation of                 new materials.",
