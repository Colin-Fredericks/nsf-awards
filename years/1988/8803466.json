 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two different two-layer models will be used to investigate                 the role of eddies in determining climate and climate                           sensitivity.  One model will be a conventional quasi-geostrophic                model, and the other will be the two-layer model proposed by                    Lorenz (1960b) which allows the eddies to interact with the                     static stability.  The circulations will be forced by                           differential heating parameterized by Newtonian cooling.                        Dissipation will be in the form of Ekman suction at the lower                   boundary.  Initially topography will be omitted, but it will be                 added at a later date.  The models' horizontal resolution will                  not be constrained a priori, but previous studies indicate that                 the eddy fluxes can be simulated accurately with relatively low                 truncation.  The study will differ from other climate studies                   with low-order models because of the inclusion of the eddy-mean                 flow interactions associated with the meridional eddy flux of                   momentum and with the vertical eddy flux of heat, and because of                its focus on how the interactions are affected by diabaticity and               dissipation.                                                                         The results of the study should yield information of                       fundamental importance for understanding climate and climate                    sensitivity, and information of value for parameterizing the                    effects of eddies in simpler climate models.",
