 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major goal of this project is to isolate a piece of genetic                 material (complementary DNA) for the retinal/pineal gene coding                 for N-acetyltransferase (NAT).  After verifying the structure of                this enzyme, NAT gene expression will be examined during                        neurochemical transduction in the light:dark cycle. Neurochemical               transduction in the pineal involves the conversion of one signal,               the release of norepinephrine at the surface of the pinealocyte,                into a second signal, the release of melatonin from within the                  pinealocyte.                                                                                                                                                    The cyclic rhythm of retinal and pineal melatonin is dependent on               the enzyme, NAT.  NAT is synchronized by the light:dark cycle of                the environment.  The pineal melatonin functions as a                           synchronizer that entrains physiology to the appropriate season                 of the year.  The retinal melatonin, which has similar                          controlling elements and light:dark responses as the pineal, may                also be responsible for this environmental synchronization.  In                 addition, retinal melatonin affects various retinal functions:                  photoreceptor outer-disc shedding, pigment granule aggregation,                 cellular levels of second messengers, and release of                            transmitters.  Alteration of melatonin synthesis may alter the                  ability of the eye to perceive light as a cue for rhythm                        synchronization.                                                                                                                                                Even though the physiological significance of melatonin is still                not known, this project will clearly extend basic knowledge of                  this indoleamine in the visual and signal transduction process.                 Practical applications of the research would include using the                  probe in mapping the human genome and as a genetic marker.                                                                                                      The experiments described will employ recombinant DNA tools to                  begin examining the influence of environmental cues on the genes                expressed in the pineal and retina.  The pineal has been studied                extensively by physiological, pharmacological and biochemical                   approaches.  These studies will extend the knowledge of the                     normal structure of genes expressed in the individual and may                   lead to understanding the involvement of other synthesizing                     enzymes in regulating normal physiological functions.",
