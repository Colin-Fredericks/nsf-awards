 "awd_abstract_narration": "The acoustical resonance measurement techniques in this project                 provide a nonintrusive and realtime measurement of mass loading                 and sizing of particles fluidized by a gas phase.  The speed of                 sound in a two-phase mixture of particles in gas decreases as the               mass density of the particles increases.  By measuring the                      decrease in the resonant frequencies, which are linearly related                to the speed of sound, the mass density of the particles is                     determined.  Because the speed of sound is dispersive with the                  frequency dependence of the sound speed provides a method of                    determining the particle sizing by measurement of the frequencies               of different resonant modes.                                                                                                                                    For realistic applications, a longitudinal resonance is required                for the acoustical resonance measurement.  A first order                        acoustical analysis of this nonintrusive technique applied to                   longitudinal resonances is used for the conditions found in the                 pneumatic conveyance of pulverized coal in electrical utility                   power plants.  The analytical investigation includes evaluation                 over the full operating ranges of the plant.  Experimental                      measurements on a closed loop tests laboratory scale test stand                 and at a power plant are conducted to verify the technique.  The                analyses are used to interpret the results of the experimental                  measurements.",
