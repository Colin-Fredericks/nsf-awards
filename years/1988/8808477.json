 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates the use of artificial ground freezing as a           means of containing and consolidating hazardous waste.  A two                   dimensional finite element simulation of soil solidification is                 proposed.  The numerical strategy utilizes innovative techniques for            representing dendrite curvature, finite element grid deployment and             numerical heat and mass conservation.  The solidification model is              based on the coupled, transient heat and mass equations in both frozen          and unfrozen phases.  Boundary conditions account for the interfacial           energy, kinetics and solute rejection effects.  The adaptive finite             element mesh continually tracks the phase front such that boundary              conditions are applied directly on the interface.  An automatic                 rediscretization routine is employed which requires no user                     intervention during the simulation.  The numerical simulations will be          compared to existing, large-scale experimental data for situations              involving the solidification of soils with and without sodium chloride          and soils spiked with hazardous wastes (chloroform, benzene, toluene            and tetrachloroethylene).                                                                                                                                       Artificial ground freezing has been in practice for over a century in           civil engineering applications.  Its ability to form impermeable                barriers, dewater sludge, and consolidate solids has been                       demonstrated.  However, predicting or controlling the location of the           frozen barrier as a function of time for arbitrary geometries is                unsolved.  Inherent in the coupled heat and mass transfer system lie            instabilities associated with the growth of dendrites due to                    undercooling and constitutional supercooling.  The coupled transport            system dealing with solidification of the soil is unamendable to                analytical solutions beyond one dimensional situations.  Consequently,          this proposal research holds great promise if illuminating the                  solution to the control of ground freezing.",
