 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Biotechnology Process Engineering Center (BPEC) at M.I.T. has               been renewed for a period of five years.  This Center was one of                the six Centers established by NSF in 1985.  The vision and the                 strategic plan of BPEC is to develop advanced concepts for the                  manufacturing of complex proteins and to train a new breed of                   professionals with cross-disciplinary skills needed to support                  the U.S. biotechnological industry.  Three thrust areas for                     research have been established to meet the critical future needs                of the manufacturers of biotechnological products.  These are:                  (1) Genetics, Molecular Biology and Biochemical Principles in                   Protein Production, (2) Engineering Principles of Protein                       Production, and (3) Downstream Processing in Biotechnology.                                                                                                     A strong industrial collaboration program with 46 companies has                 been established.  Five departments at M.I.T. and one department                in the Harvard University will participate in research and                      teaching.  Educational programs are directed towards                            undergraduate, graduate, post-doctoral and industrial personnel.                Two new undergraduate and three new graduate courses with cross-                disciplinary focus will be offered by BPEC.",
