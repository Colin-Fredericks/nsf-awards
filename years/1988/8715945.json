 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extensive collections of fossil decapod crustaceans, which were                 made on Seymour Island, Antarctica, during the 1986-1987 field                  season, permit continuation and extension of research on the                    paleobiology of this group throughout the southern high latitude                region.  These specimens extend the distribution of decapods in                 Late Cretaceous-Paleocene, making it possible to test the extent                to which the terminal Cretaceous extinction event effected decapod              faunas in high latitude regions.  Because several new, or recently              described taxa are ancestral to modern deep-water forms, it is                  also possible to determine whether the organisms possess similar                reproductive strategies which may have served equally well as an                adaptation to deep-water and high latitude shallow-water habitats.              Further, the extended information regarding the distribution of                 decapods from Seymour Island can be coupled with data derived from              detailed collecting of sites in New Zealand, containing comparable              faunas, to further expand our knowledge of the biogeographic                    distribution of Southern Hemisphere forms.",
