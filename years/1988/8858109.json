 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Presidential Young Investigator Award is for support of               Mary Beckman at the Ohio State University.  Her research is aimed               at understanding and modeling the prosodic patterns which                       organize speech into coherent units of sound.                                        Earlier work, including most exisitng speech synthesis                     systems and all speech recognition systems, is based on                         linguistic theories from the 1960s, which posited only a single                 type of organizational unit, the phonetic segment, which                        constituted the informational primitives.                                            More recently, however, linguists have recognized that the                 prosodic patterns of intonation and stress organize speech into                 units of various sizes.  A computational model based on those                   theories would take advantage of the way prosodic patterns encode               a hierarchy of phonological words and phrases.  Such a model                    would make constructive use of the variation in spectral                        patterning that accrues from a segment's position in the                        organizational structure to recover the higher-level                            informational structure.                                                             The significance of this work is that it should yield a                    computational model for timing patterns that will be implemented                in an articulatory synthesis program and ultimately will be                     incorporated into an automatic speech recognition system, thus                  bringing a new set of tools to bear on a difficult problem area.",
