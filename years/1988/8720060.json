 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will examine and assess a variety of parallel             architectures for their capabilities on a range of perpceptual tasks.           (1) A procedure will be developed to describe and specify multi-                computers in terms of their basic components, assign costs, and from            this assess hardware complexity and total costs; (2) Underlying                 topologies will be categorized, and generic, generalized structures and         specific multi-computers chosen from each for further examination; (3)          Algorithms will be developed (consulting architects, for balance) for a         range of perceptual tasks, from image enhancement to object recognition         and computer vision; (4) For each architecture, the performance (time           and hardware needed) of each algorithm will be analyzed and estimated;          for a selected set, the algorithm will be programmed and run.                                                                                                   The results will give a systematic set of comparisons between                   topologies, and between particular multi-computers within each                  topology.  Selected comparisons will show how closely actual                    performance is predicted by estimated performance,  and indicate where          and how to improve upon the specifications of basic components and              their costs.  Thus tools will be developed for relatively quickly               estimating architectures' capabilities.",
