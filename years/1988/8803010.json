 "awd_abstract_narration": "A dropshaft filled with helical vanes of fixed helix angle has been             developed.  These produce swirl and a resulting inward centrifuging             effect for entrapped air in the dropshaft flow.  Simultaneously, the            vanes act as an effective, continuously distributed source of                   friction to dissipate energy.  Dropshafts connect collection elements           in municipal surface drainage systems to large underground conveyance           tunnels.  Air venting and energy dissipation are key requirements.              The new design integrates both features effectively.  The project is            to explore a variation of this design for the case of very deep                 dropshafts in which energy dissipation must be limited.  This is                accomplished with shafts only partially filled with vanes, with a               variable helix angle entrance section.  The flow structure in such a            configuration, and optimization of the configuration, will be                   determined experimentally.  A simple analytical model of the flow               will also be developed.  The design  holds the potential for                    elimination of very large deaeration chambers and separate energy               dissipators, leading to much smaller and more economical                        installations.",
