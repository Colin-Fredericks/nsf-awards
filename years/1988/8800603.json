 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous research on the civil jury has focused on the                     magnitude of damage awards as an indicator of perceived liability               and has not addressed the processes and strategies used by jurors               in determining appropriate damages.  This program of experimental               research being undertaken by Drs. Loftus and Goodman seeks to                   examine the ways in which jurors and juries make decisions based                on ambiguous and incomplete evidence on economic damages.  Using                potential jurors drawn from a list of registered voters, two                    mock-jury experiments are planned that focus on (a) the influence               of general versus specific verdict forms on how juries go about                 awarding economic and non-economic damages and (b) the influence                of perceived level of liability and the magnitude of the damages                being sought on ultimate damage awards.                                              These experiments promise important scientific contributions               to the field:  They should illuminate our knowledge of jurors'                  abilities to follow standard jury instructions distinguishing                   economic and non-economic considerations.  In particular, the                   experiments should valuably speak to whether an actuarial verdict               form is more likely to yield evidence-driven deliberation and a                 general verdict form more likely to yield verdict-driven                        discussion.  Also, the work should add substantially to our                     understanding of whether jurors are able to separate issues of                  liability and damages and whether deliberation enables making                   that distinction.  Finally, by obtaining pre- and post-                         deliberation data from jurors as well as full deliberation data                 from juries, these studies should contribute broadly to our                     knowledge of the impact of group process on legal judgments.",
