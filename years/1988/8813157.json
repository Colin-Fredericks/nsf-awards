 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the MAX91 report Flare Research at the Next Solar                       Maximum, six fundamental questions identify the highest priority                flare research during solar cycle 22:                                                                                                                                1.  How and where is flare energy stored?                                       2.  What causes flare energy release?                                           3.  What are the mechanisms of flare energy release?                            4.  How are energetic particles accelerated?                                    5.  What are the mechanisms of flare energy transport?                          6.  How do flare effects propagate to Earth?                                                                                                                    None of these questions can be answered in a satisfactory                  manner without vector magnetic field measurements.  Such                        observations are as important to understanding solar flares as                  are y-ray, X-ray, or microwave observations.  The collective                    research experience during the last two solar cycles has shown                  that only through coordinated multispectral sets of observations                can we hope to understand how and why solar flares occur.                            Dedicated observations with a high-performace imaging vector               magnetograph at Mees Solar Observatory (Haleakala, Maui) will                   maximize the continuity, frequency, and reliability of vector                   magnetic field measurements of solar flares and active regions                  during the MAX91 time period (1991-1994).  This instrument will                 provide solar vector magnetic field data that are necessary: (1)                to understand the relationship between the coronal structure and                evolution of vector magnetic fields, X-rays, and particle                       acceleration; (2) to measure the variation of magnetic free                     energy of active regions and its relationship to major solar                    flares; (3) to map photospheric electrical currents and relate                  them to coronal X-ray structures and the sites of energetic                     particle precipitation.  The instrument will obtain the required                narrow-band polarimetric images using a rotating quarter-wave                   plate, Fabry-Perot etalon, and acousto-optic tunable filter,                    building on experience with these components at the telescopes of               the University of Hawaii.  Its benefits to solar research during                MAX91 will accrue from its high spatial, spectral, and temporal                 resolution, spectral agility, and on-line data reduction                        capabilities.",
