 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the design of a VLSI architecture, there are several choices                 of performance parameters for each sub-system available to a                    designer.  The choice of design parameters is so complex that                   very seldom is the whole design space explored.  To explore                     alternative designs, the only recourse a designer has is to                     redesign the target parts completely.  Dr. Tyagi is investigating               automation of this process.  He is exploring a general set of                   design transforms that, when applied to a given design with a set               of performance parameters (in terms of area, energy, and time),                 can produce a design with the desired performance.  The                         principal investigator's initial research indicates that such a                 set of transforms can be identified and implemented.  He is                     applying the transforms to designing functions such as shifting,                multiplication and sorting, and finding techniques to compose                   these functions into an architecture with given performance                     characteristics.",
