 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent theoretical arguments and experimental results suggest a                 role for glutamate in the function of N2-fixing bacteroids.  An                 examination of the literature indicates that the best way to                    accommodate a role for glutamate is to propose that a malate-                   aspartate shuttle operates in legume nodules.  There is a                       surprisingly large amount of published evidence to support this                 hypothesis, but it has not been thoroughly tested.  These                       experiments will directly test the hypothesis by determining the                patterns of labeling of metabolites in cytosol and bacteroids,                  the effect of substrates on the acetylene reduction activity and                respiration rate of anaerobically isolated bacteroids, and the                  distribution and properties of enzymes required for the operation               of the malate-aspartate shuttle.                                                                                                                                The hypothesis is attractive because it can be tested by many                   approaches, all of which involve straight-forward methods.  If                  the hypothesis is correct, one of the major unresolved questions                in symbiotic N2 fixation - namely, how reducing equivalents are                 supplied to bacteroids - would be answered.  If the hypothesis is               not correct, the proposed experiments will still provide                        important new insights regarding carbon metabolism in legume                    nodules.                                                                                                                                                        Some plants are \"colonized\" by bacteria which convert gaseous                   nitrogen to an organic form usable by the plant.  The plant must                provide a substantial amount of energy to its symbiont in                       exchange.  In fact, the plant provides more energy to the                       bacterium than it costs to fix the nitrogen.  One of the major                  unanswered questions is how energy is provided to the symbiont.                 This project directly tests a new hypothesis that organic acids                 containing nitrogen are involved in this exchange.",
