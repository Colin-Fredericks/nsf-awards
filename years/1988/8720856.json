 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently, significant temporal variations in local earthquake              coda decay rate (coda Q-1) have been observed associated with (1)               the long-term migration of seismicity in China, (2) the Round                   Valley earthquake of 1984, (3) the North Palm Springs earthquake                of 1986, (4) the Misasa earthquake of 1983 and (5) an eruption of               Mt. St. Helens.  Some of these variations have different patterns               depending on the frequency of coda waves and the depth of                       earthquakes.                                                                                                                                                         The understanding of these phenomena is urgently needed                    because of their potential use as a much wanted reliable precursor              for intermediate-term earthquake prediction.  In order to promote               the understanding, we propose to:                                                                                                                                    (1) Continue work on systematic determination of spatial                             variation in coda Q using the USGS Central California                           network and the USGS/Caltech/USC southern California                            network.                                                                                                                                                   (2) Perform case studies of temporal variation in coda Q in                         California, such as the San Jacinto fault zone,                                 where focal depths range from 0 to 20 km (similar to the                        North Palm Springs area).",
