 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an investigation of the chemistry occurring on and within               catalyst particles that causes carbon filaments to grow in                      various conformations.  Filaments can be formed in three basic                  conformations:  whisker-like, branched, and multidirectional.                   Specific issues include the effects of the crystallographic                     features of the catalyst particle on the mechanism of the                       hydrocarbon decomposition reaction; how reaction conditions                     influence the structural characteristics of carbon filaments                    produced from a given catalyst hydrocarbon system; and the                      effects that the introduction of a second metal into the catalyst               has on carbon diffusion pathways.  A combination of techniques                  are used to study these aspects including controlled-atmosphere                 electron microscopy (CAEM), high-resolution transmission electron               microscopy (HRTEM) with in-situ electron diffraction, specialized               in-situ surface spectroscopy, carbon-13 nuclear magnetic                        resonance, and bulk kinetic studies.                                                                                                                            The notion of growing carbon filaments onto the surfaces of                     primary fibers by catalytic decomposition of a hydrocarbon offers               the potential of producing a new generation of composites with                  unique physical, chemical, and electronic properties.  Carbon                   filaments are produced by the catalytic decomposition of                        hydrocarbons on small metal particles.  Iron, cobalt, or nickel                 promote this process.  The filaments have a duplex structure - a                graphitic skin surrounding a core that is more easily oxidized.",
