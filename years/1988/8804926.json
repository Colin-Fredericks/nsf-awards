 "awd_abstract_narration": "Annual variation in stream flow is associated with dramatic             fluctuations in invertebrate abundance and the density of                       juvenile cyprinid and centrarchid fishes.  In the absence of                    centrarchid predation, small fishes depress invertebrate                        abundance in pool habitats but not riffles, and centrarchid                     predators restrict juvenile fishes to shallow riffle refugia                    while engaging in species- and size-selective predation.                                This research is a logical extension of these findings.                 Experiments will quantify the simultaneous influence of stream                  flow, centrarchid predation, and juvenile fish density on                       invertebrate resources and juvenile cyprinid and centrarchid                    fishes below a beaver pond.  Hypotheses will be tested related to               the following four questions:                                                                                                                                           1.  How sensitive is the growth and survivorship of juvenile                     cyprinid and centrarchid fishes to changes in fish                              density and what, if any, effect does interspecific use                         of invertebrate resources have on the growth and                                survivorship of these fishes?                                                  2.  Do changes in flow regime below beaver ponds shift the                       intensity and outcome of resource use by juvenile                               cyprinid and centrarchid fishes?                                               3.  What effect do centrarchid predators have on the                             intensity and outcome of resource use by juvenile                               cyprinids and centrarchids?                                                    4.  How do changes in flow regime below beaver ponds effect                      predator-prey interactions and the outcome of                                   invertebrate resource use by juvenile cyprinid and                              centrarchid fishes?                                                                                                                                            This research will greatly enhance our understanding of the             regulation of growth and survival in stream fishes.  It will also               increase our ability to incorporate the effect of hydrologic                    regime on trophic interactions into emerging conceptual models of               north-temperate aquatic landscapes.",
