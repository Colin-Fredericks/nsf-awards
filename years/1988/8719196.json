 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is in the area of geometrical modelling.  It is organized         into three categories of projects.  The largest is a collaborative              effort centered on a VLSI raycasting engine that should improve                 dramatically the performance of solid modelling systems.  An NSF-funded         team at Duke University will supply experimental prototypes of the              special purpose computer; Cornell will create and operate appropriate           test beds for production automation applications and will study a range         of issues bearing on the integration of the computer into systems and           on new applications and extensions of the technology.  A second                 category of theory-and-algorithm projects will emphasize research on            active-zone algorithms, spatial sweeping domain extensions and other            geometric modelling problems.  The third category of projects is                exploratory in character and includes the management of complexity and          modelling support for mechanical design.                                        The principal investigator is a capable researcher and has done                 pioneering work in solid modelling.  The funding of this project will           make possible the testing of the raycasting machine designed at Duke            University by an expert user, as well as providing the environment for          new research in solid modelling.  Approximately half of the project             relates to the testing and evaluating the performance of the ray-               casting machine and is funded by the Experimental Systems Program,              Division of Microelectronic Information Processing Systems (MIPS), and          the other half of the project relates to new work in solid modelling            and is funded by the Division of Design, Manufacturing, and Computer-           Integrated Engineering (DMCE).",
