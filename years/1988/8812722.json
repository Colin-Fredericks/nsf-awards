 "awd_abstract_narration": "Relativity theory (both special and general) and quantum theory                 represent the two great scientific revolutions of the 20th                      century which not only have changed physics itself but also our                 general world view.  The repercussions of these theories are                    still being worked out in physics, history, and philosophy of                   science.  In order to understand fully the meanings and impacts                 of quantum theory, an enormous range of studies remain to be                    carried out.  Dr. Miller, under this research grant, is examining               one of the most important areas of this range of projects.  He is               investigating the introduction, interpretation, and development                 of intrinsic (or internal) symmetries into quantum mechanics,                   starting with Werner Heisenberg's formulation of the concept in                 1926 through Wolfgang Pauli's classic paper of 1940 on the                      connection among spin, statistics and Lorentz invariance.  Other                key figures in this area of research are Niels Bohr, P. A. M.                   Dirac, Lev Landau, Rudolf Peierls, Victor Weisskopf, and Eugene                 Wigner.  The development of the concept of intrinsic symmetries                 in quantum mechanics brought about wide-ranging transformations                 in the notions of space, time, causality, and substance --                      central concepts for our view of the world.  An understanding of                these developments thus promises to contribute to both the                      history and the philosophy of science as well as to cultural                    history as society has come to understand the radical shifts that               this theory has forced on the meaning of causality and certainty                in the world.",
