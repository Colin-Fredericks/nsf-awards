 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports this institution's Mechanical Engineering            Technology program and a new program in Manufacturing and Design.               Students of manufacturing and design, mechanical, industrial automation         and electronic engineering technology study the concepts and techniques         of computer-integrated processing and the interfacing necessary for             computer-assisted functions. Utilizing workcells, students experiment           with production operations in the laboratory. The laboratory supporting         this project includes the following equipment: three CNC machine tools          (one mill and two lathes) linked to the CADAM system for CAD/CAM                production, integrated with robots, microprocessors and programmable            logic controllers. Manufacturing precision is verified with an optical          comparator and manual gages. Students are trained as technologists in           this state-of-the-art laboratory to serve a critical need in the                Nation.                                                                                                                                                              This award is matched by an equal amount from this institution.",
