 "awd_abstract_narration": "Twenty-five undergraduate teaching faculty attending this two-week              short course will work with the principles and applications of optics           in engineering.  A mixture of lectures, demonstrations, with hands-on           laboratory experiments and projects represents the core of this                 enhancement program.  Participants will be provided with a prepared set         of notes on most topics which will be covered including Fourier                 analysis, diffraction theory, interferometry, geometrical optics,               holography, shearography, Moire' methods, optical data processing               methods, nondestructive testing, and digital image processing.                  Participants will have intensive work experience with the latest in             optical equipment and related instrumentation, much of which is                 computer controlled.  Oakland University possesses outstanding applied          optics facilities, which will enable participants to work with the              modern instrumentation.  In addition, the very latest equipment                 available will be borrowed from manufacturers and suppliers and set-up          in Oakland's laboratories for participant use.                                                                                                                  A follow-up evaluation of the impact of this enhancement experience             will be conducted one year later.                                                                                                                               In addition to NSF funds, participants' institutions will provide               about 10% in travel costs toward the operation of the project.",
