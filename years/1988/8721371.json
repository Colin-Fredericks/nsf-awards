 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project provides partial support for a U.S.                  delegation to attend an international congress on plant physiology              to be followed by an Indo-U.S.  Workshop on the application of                  biotechnology to problems of crop stress.  The congress includes                four symposium topics: physiological basis of crop yield,                       environmental stress, nutritional stress, and preharvest and post               harvest physiology and biochemistry.  The workshop's aim is to                  focus cooperative projects on overcoming physiological constraints              to crop productivity, especially those that are related to cold                 climate, arid lands or under saline conditions.                                                                                                                 Scope:  The U.S. participants in the Congress, of whom 13 are to be             supported under this project, are well known scientists in the                  specific areas of the conference, namely plant physiology, crop                 production and biotechnology.  Other speakers will come from                    Canada, Australia as will as India.  Indian plant scientists and                biotechnologists have accomplished major successes in improving                 their agricultural output, but there is still great interest in                 India in combating the devastating effects of droughts, and in                  expanding farming to marginal land and adverse weather conditions.              The same applies to certain region in the U.S. as well as in many               developing countries.  The congress and the workshop will provide a             forum for the exchange of information and highlight specific                    research areas likely to produce significant applicable results.                There is strong likelihood of increased research collaboration as a             result of these meetings.",
