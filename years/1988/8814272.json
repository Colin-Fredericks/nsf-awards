 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of nutrient cycling processes and their relation                 to autotrophic production is of fundamental importance in the                   analysis of natural ecosystems.  While it is axiomatic that                     aquatic ecosystems at the land-sea interface are among the most                 productive in the biosphere, surprisingly little is known about                 nutrient inputs from land, fate and cycling of these nutrients,                 and associated organic production.  Recent analyses have                        suggested that estuaries may be generally heterotrophic (gross                  primary production is less than community respiration), implying                that they are nutrient sources to the sea rather than sinks of                  terrestrial inputs.  For the proposed research program, a                       cohesive interdisciplinary team of ecologists, geochemists,                     modelers and oceanographers has been assembled to address two                   hypotheses: 1) Chesapeake Bay, as an example of a coastal plain                 estuary, supports a N-limited autotrophic (GPP exceeds R)                       community which exports DON offshore as a consequence of internal               cycling and transformation processes; and 2) spring inputs of N                 from land are coupled to the summer productivity maximum by                     phytoplankton assimilation and biomass deposition in spring with                subsequent benthic regeneration and vertical transport during                   summer.  These hypotheses will be tested in this 5-year project                 by making regular measurements of hydrographic variables and key                carbon and nutrient processes at stations along the main salinity               gradient and at times emphasizing spring and summer periods.                         Estuaries, in this cases especially the Chesapeake Bay, are                important zones of ecological interaction mediating the exchange                processes of continents and oceans.  They provide a broad array                 of exploitable resources as fragile as the estuarine system                     itself.  Research such as this will allow the more informed                     management of coastal ecosystems.",
