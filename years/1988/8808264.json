 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Engineering Research Equipment Grant will support experimental             research focused primarily on the development of Acoustic Charge                Transport (ACT) devices, a relatively new technology.  Very briefly,            the ACT device was invented at the University of Illinois by Hoskins            and Hunsinger in 1982 and is essentially a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD)          for which the charge packets are transported by the potential which             propagates with a surface acoustic wave (SAW) instead of the potential          imposed by clock pulses applied to surface electrodes.  ACT devices             with charge transfer efficiencies of 0.99994 and bandwidths of 200 MHz          have been fabricated and this is well beyond what has been achieved             with CCD technology.  ACT is a promising and viable technology which            has thus far been used to make convolvers, correlators, filters, and            analog memories.  Other potential devices included A/D converters,              array processors, programmable filters and imagers.  Because the                acoustic wave transports the charge, tap weight accuracies for filters          and other ACT signal processing devices depend on the ability of the            device designer to describe the acoustic beam profile.  As such,                acoustics play a crucial role in the emergence and development of this          technology.  The network analyzer requested in this proposal is part            of a laser probe measurement system to be used in studying the details          of SAW propagation and generation in piezoelectric semiconductors and           heterostructures of piezoelectric semiconductors as they pertain to             the performance of ACT devices.",
