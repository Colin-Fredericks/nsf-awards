 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Iowa Middle School Science Project is a cooperative project                 involving the fifteen Iowa Area Education agencies and faculty members          from Cornell College, Coe College, the University of Iowa, and the              University of Northern Iowa.                                                                                                                                    Ninety teachers (thirty each year one from at least three different             grade levels) representing the school districts of the fifteen Area             Educational Agencies (AEA) will participate in a six week summer                institute held at Coe College in Cedar Rapids.  During the academic             year, regional AEA sites will host at least two, 2 day follow-up                meetings to support the participants.                                                                                                                           Each of the three years basically duplicates the first year with one            additional feature.  Participants from the preceding year will return           for one week to extend their work and to interact with the incoming             participants.                                                                                                                                                   Science concepts from physics, chemistry, earth science, and biology            will be presented.  The pedogogical components include an emphasis on           the Learning Cycle Model as well as including misconception research and        Cooperative Learning approaches into teaching science.                                                                                                          The participants will form a Science Cadre which will design and arrange        workshops for the non-participating teachers in each of the Area                Education Agencies.  Local District Inservice Programs will be held 4-5         times in each of the 15 agencies.  The district inservice activities            will be conducted by the project staff and capable AEA Cadre members.                                                                                           All participants will participate in the Project Bulletin Board, which          is the proposed state node for the National Computer Network for Science        Education currently being funded by the National Science Foundation             (NSF).                                                                                                                                                          The projects allowed a large number of teachers to be involved in a             state-wide inservice program.  It demonstrates that a cooperative               endeavor across district lines is a viable approach to developing               programs.                                                                                                                                                       The Area Education Agencies and the State of Iowa Department of                 Education have contributed an amount equal to 34% of the NSF award.",
