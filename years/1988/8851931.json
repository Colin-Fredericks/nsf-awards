 "awd_abstract_narration": "A computer-controlled, Fourier transform infrared                          spectrophotometer is being incorporated into a project-based                    laboratory curriculum at a women's college.  This laboratory program,           developed over many years, involves students early with problem-solving         and chemical instrumentation.  The small classes permit introducing             freshmen to basic spectral techniques and the FT-IR, in its one-button          mode, is exposing these students to this powerful technology.                   Involvement with instrumentation is expanded through organic chemistry,         quantitative analysis and an advanced lab in the junior year.  The FT-          IR is being used extensively in physical chemistry for kinetics                 experiments and to obtain high resolution spectra of gases.  The FT-IR          is greatly enhancing current experiments and numerous experiences, not          previously possible are becoming routine, including computer data               handling, spectral database searches, and reflectance sampling                  methods.  Exposing students to the FT-IR at progressively higher                levels is allowing them to use all of its capabilities.
