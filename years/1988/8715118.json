About 12                    species have been recognized in the genus, but because the plants               are small, leafless herbs which are superficially similar, their                taxonomy is problematic. One primary objective of the study is to               re-evaluate the species of Corallorhiza using new multivariate                  statistical techniques applied to old as well as new characters.                These characters will come from a thorough study of the genus                   with regard to shape and form of their flowers and stems, their                 internal construction (anatomy), and the mutational changes which               can be measured by comparing their DNA (especially chloroplast                  DNA).                                                                                In addition to indicating the species boundaries within the                genus, this information will be used to address other questions,                such as the evolutionary relationships of Corallorhiza species.                 DNA information, analyzed by computer-aided cladistic methods,                  will be especially important here. Additional questions in the                  group include the evolution of self-pollination, possible                       parallel trends among species in mycotrophy, and evolution of the               chloroplast DNA in a leafless group of plants relative to that in               leafy plants. Such information will be of general use in further                orchid research.",
