 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research seeks to determine the mechanisms by which the                    plant chromoprotein, phytochrome, photoreversibly regulates                     the activity of nuclear enzymes, especially that of a                           chromatin-associated nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase).  The                   research is designed to follow up and extend earlier findings                   which showed that red-light activated phytochrome could                         stimulate NTPase activity and nuclear protein phosphorylation                   in isolated pea nuclei and that Ca2+ and calmodulin played                      important roles in this response.  It will be determined how                    much Ca2+ is required to support the NTPase stimulation and                     determine whether red light induces a change in the free                        \u0131Ca2+! in the nuclear preparation.  Phytochrome will be                         immunocytochemically localized in isolated nuclei to help                       evaluate where within the preparation it may be functioning.                    Binding of purified NTPase to DNA will be studied.  Specific                    DNA sequences that are recognized by the enzyme will be                         sought.  There is evidence the NTPase may be phosphorylated                     by a spermine-activated NII kinase.  This kinase will be                        isolated and characterized to test whether it can                               phosphorylate the NTPase and whether its activation is                          promoted also by calcium.%%%                                                                                                                                    Results expected from the proposed experiments should                           contribute significantly to an improved understanding of how                    light and Ca2+ can regulate nuclear metabolism, with possible                   implications also for models of how phytochrome regulates                       gene expression.  The ultimate aim of this project is to                        understand how the plant photoreceptor, phytochrome, controls                   growth and development changes in plants.  Current data favor                   the hypothesis that phytochrome achieves this control in many                   instances by inducing specific alterations of membrane                          properties in target cells.***//",
