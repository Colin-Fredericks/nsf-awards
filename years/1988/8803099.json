 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Professor                Mourad Ismail of the University of South Florida in Tampa and                   Professor Jairo Charris of the National University of Colombia in               Bogota, Colombia.  The investigators plan to carry out research                 problems in the following three areas:  1)  Differential Equations,             2)  Difference Equations, and 3) Orthogonal Polynomials.  More                  specifically, they plan to study a class of differential equations              of order 2 with an arbitrary number of regular singular points.                 They also plan to construct spectral measures of certain families               of fourth order difference equations and study orthogonal                       polynomials arising from discrete Schrodinger operators with quasi              periodic potentials.  Additionally, they will investigate                       polynomials orthogonal on several intervals and the distribution                and monotonicity of zeros of orthogonal polynomials depending on a              parameter.                                                                                                                                                      The U.S. investigator is an experienced and respected researcher                who has obtained important results in these areas.  By helping to               bring together Professor Ismail with a promising researcher from a              developing country to work on problems of mutual interest, this                 award fulfills the objectives of the Science in Developing                      Countries Program.",
