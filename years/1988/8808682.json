 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most of the populated regions of the world are concentrated in                  valleys, that is, on sedimentary deposits composed of different                 layers of cohesionless and cohesive soils, including nonplastic and             plastic silts.  The phenomenon of the amplification of ground motion            in sedimentary deposits, as well as the loss of bearing capacity in             all types of soils, and the liquefaction of saturated sandy or silty            soils due to earthquake shaking, are only partially understood.  The            engineering properties if all soil materials (gravel, sand, silt,               clay) under irregular seismic loads must be known in order to fully             understand the above phenomena.                                                                                                                                 This research project involves a laboratory investigation and                   analytical modelling of the response of saturated silty soils to                irregular seismic loads.  Loading conditions corresponding to the               propagation of seismic waves will be simulated in the laboratory                using cyclic direct simple shear and cyclic triaxial devices.                   Degradation of soil stiffness during cyclic loading, the associated             variation of cyclic pore pressure, and the rules governing irregular            cyclic stress-strain behavior are being investigated.  The results              obtained for silty soils are being compared to the corresponding                available results on sands and clays.  This comparison provides a               basis for the development of mathematical models for the reduction in           stiffness and the development of pore water pressure, valid for all             three types of soils.",
