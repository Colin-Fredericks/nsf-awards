 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this research is to investigate the               influence of thermal damping and surface drag on the equilibrium                behavior of nonlinear baroclinic waves.  This will be done by                   carrying out numerical experiments with a multi-level primitive                 equation model.  The simulations will first be of a single-wave                 type (in which the nonlinear interactions are largely those                     between one zonal wave and the zonal-mean flow), and then be                    multiple-wave in nature (with considerable interactions between                 different zonal waves).  In the numerical experiments the effects               of thermal damping and surface drag will be simply represented,                 by Newtonian cooling and a simple frictional parameterization.                  Analysis of the simulations will focus upon the \"regime\"                        character and variability, and also on the structure of the                     equilibrated zonal-mean flows.  This work will contribute to the                basic understanding of fully developed baroclinic flows in which                asymmetric external forcing is absent.                                               This research is important because the dynamics of the                     atmospheric waves to be studied has a profound influence on                     extended weather features, and hence climate. Improvements in                   climate modeling and prediction require enhanced knowledge of                   these dynamics.",
