 "awd_abstract_narration": "The reduction of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia, termed                   nitrogen fixation, is inhibited by oxygen; hence, oxygen-evolving               photosystem II and nitrogen fixation cannot coexist.  Some of the               filamentous cyanobacteria, which have photosystem II, can                       differentiate cells, called heterocysts, that are specialized for               nitrogen fixation.  Many structural and biochemical changes occur               during heterocyst differentiation, including loss of photosystem                II (PSII) activity.  Dr. Thiel will study the mechanism of                      inactivation of the components of this photosystem during                       heterocyst differentiation.  She will identify in a heterocyst-                 forming cyanobacterium the genes for PSII components by Southern                hybridization and the protein components of PSII by Western                     blots, and will study the regulation of transcription of these                  genes and the turnover of these proteins during heterocyst                      differentiation.  These studies should provide information on the               cellular mechanisms that allow an organism that has oxygen                      evolving PSII to also fix nitrogen.                                                  Dr. Thiel will team teach courses in Microbiology and in                   Bioenergetics, give lectures in graduate seminar courses, and                   direct the research of graduate students.  She will also give                   formal seminars and have informal discussions on opportunities                  for women in science through the Women's Resource Center at                     Washington University.                                                               This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1)                 to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                  engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF                  and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and                     engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists                and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic                    institutions.  By encouraging the participation of women in                     science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future                     scientific vitality.",
