 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in molecular                           biophysics to be conducted by Prof. John J. Hopfield                            at the California Institute of Technology and Dr.                               David Beratan of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory                                  (Caltech) and Prof. Jose Nelson Onuchic of the Sao                              Carlos Institute of Physics and Chemistry, University                           of Sao Paulo, Brazil.  They will construct a                                    microscopic predictive model for biological charge                              (electron) transfer reactions in proteins.                                      Specifically, predictions for the relative rates (and                           distance and temperature dependence) of electron                                transfer in isomers of heme proteins will be                                    developed.  These electron tranfer reactions are basic                          to nearly all energetic processes in biological                                 systems and therefore are of great interest at the                              present time.                                                                                                                                                   Both Prof. Hopfield and Dr. Beratan will visit San                              Carlos. Only Dr. Beratan's travel will be supported by                          this grant.  They will work with Prof. Onuchic to                               calculate matrix elements for different isomers in                              myoglobin derivatives after myoglobin crystal                                   structures have been examined in different ways in                              both Brazil and the U.S.  During visits to Caltech by                           Prof. Onuchic, transport temperature dependence will                            be calculated and new methods of calculation will be                            considered.  Finally the molecular parameters of                                electron transfer will be worked out.  The advanced                             computing facilities (Cray) at JPL will be used along                           with a VAX in Brazil as well as EPR and optical                                 techniques in use by Brazilian experimental groups                              studying protein dynamics.  Important scientific                                contributions will be made that could not be done so                            well by these groups working alone.",
