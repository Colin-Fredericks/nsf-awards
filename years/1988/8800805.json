 "awd_abstract_narration": "The genus Tetrahymena is an important group of ciliate                  protozoans, possibly descended with little modification from the                earliest eukaryotic organisms.  Species of this genus are                       commonly used laboratory organisms.  Dr. Clifford Brunk proposes                to obtain the DNA sequences of the actin gene in 7 to 10 species                of the genus, and to use these sequence data to reconstruct their               ancestor-descendant relationships.  This evolutionary framework                 will form the foundation for future studies of other gene                       sequences in these species.  Rates of evolution in different                    genes can then be compared, leading to a better understanding of                the mechanisms of molecular evolution.  The sequences obtained                  can also be compared with those of other early eukaryotes to                    reveal their evolutionary relationships.                                                The proposed research has implications beyond the narrow                field of ciliate systematics.  The research will illuminate the                 pattern of evolution in this early group, and will lead to a                    clearer picture of the radiation of eukaryotes.  This project                   will lead to a better understanding of how genes replicate and                  evolve within a single lineage over long periods of time.",
