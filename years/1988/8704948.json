 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal objective of this U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research              project in earthquake engineering between Roko Zarnic of the Boal               Institute for Structures and Earthquake Engineering in Ljubljana and            Daniel P. Abrams, Mete Sozen of the University of Illinois is to                study the behavior of structures composed of repaired and/or                    strengthened reinforced concrete frames with masonry infills.  Many             existing buildings in the United States have masonry infilled                   walls.   Understanding the behavior of such frames when under stress            and heavy loading is of particular importance to the development of             earthquake resistant masonry structures and reinforced concrete                 structural systems.  Through complementary abilities and facilities,            the U.S. and Yugoslav investigators expect to develop a  simple                 analytical method for determining possible earthquake damage and for            analyzing structural behavior.                                                                                                                                  This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a                joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and               Yugoslav governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually by            the Department of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  The grants are            composed principally of Yugolsav dinars and made to the principal               Yugoslav institute.  Funds include travel for U.S. scientists to                Yugoslavia and a modest dollar allowance for Yugoslav scientists'               living expenses in the U.S.",
