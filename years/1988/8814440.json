 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid advances have been made in recent years in the                       technology of detecting and analyzing optical emissions from the                upper atmosphere, to yield physical parameters related to the                   photochemistry and dynamics of the region.  The charge-coupled                  device (CCD) allows the simultaneous measurement of many                        wavelengths with higher sensitivity than photomultipliers, and                  with computer control and digital readout of data into memory,                  the amount of information now retrievable on upper atmosphere                   emissions is around two order of magnitude greater than                         previously.  As part of the CEDAR (Coupling, Energetics and                     Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions) program, A new spectrograph has                been constructed utilizing CCD technology.  The unit also                       includes several small imagers, that provide monochromatic images               of structures (such as auroral forms) that the spectrograph is                  being directed toward.  Several campaigns of observations of                    upper atmosphere emissions are planned in conjunction with                      investigators from other institutions, and a similar instrument                 is to make observations from orbit, so that simultaneous ground                 and satellite observations of the same volume of space will be                  possible.",
