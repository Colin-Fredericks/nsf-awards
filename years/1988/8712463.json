 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Drs. Joseph              Diestel and Andrew M. Tonge, Kent State University, with Dr. Hans               Jarchow, University of Zurich, Switzerland.  They will do research              and write a monograph on the theory and applications of absolutely              p-summing operators.                                                                                                                                            The theory of p-summing operators plays a central role in modern                abstract analysis, for example, as a fundamental tool for the study             of Banach spaces.  However, this is a complex area of mathematics               that has been inadequately communicated even to other                           mathematicians.  There is a need for a comprehensive, simplified                treatment of the subject and its applications that will emphasize the           relationship of the theory with other areas of analysis.  Dr. Diestel           has a strong track record in functional analysis and has published              several books that were well written and broadly read.  Dr. Tonge's             expertise in tensor products and algebras will contribute to the                project.  Dr. Jarchow has published extensively in relevant topics              such as operators on the disk algebra and on C*-algebras.  The                  project will require a large amount of background research and                  discussion among the researchers.  This award will enable them to               meet periodically to compare and synthesize their results.",
