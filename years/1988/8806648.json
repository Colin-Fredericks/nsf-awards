 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bacteria are common inhabitants on leaf surfaces and are                   both of practical importance and of scientific interest because                 they can cause plant frost injury and plant disease, produce                    phytohormones, fix nitrogen, and have other direct and indirect                 effects on plants and other organisms.  Considerable interest                   exists in modifying the microbial composition of leaves and roots               by application of microorganisms or by other means to control                   plant diseases or frost injury.  There is also considerable                     interest in predicting the effects of intentionally or                          inadvertently introducing recombinant microorganisms with unique                traits into natural habitats such as on plants.  This study will                emphasize factors that are important in intraspecific competition               of bacteria on leaves.  Competition for limiting environmental                  resources of leaves best explains the exclusion of ice nucleation               active (Ice+) Pseudomonas syringae strains from leaves previously               colonized by recombinant Ice- strains of this species both in                   greenhouse and in field tests.  Ice+ P. syringae strains that                   either coexisted with or which could not coexist with reference                 Ice- P. syringae strains on potato leaves have been identified                  and will be compared for relative competitive ability against                   Ice- P. syringae strains both in the laboratory and under field                 conditions and will be contrasted with competition exhibited by                 isogenic Ice+ P. syringae strains.  Spatial and nutritional                     heterogeneity of different P. syringae strains on leaves, and                   other features that might condition competition of bacteria on                  leaves, will be related to different patterns of competition on                 and \"invasion\" of leaves exhibited by these strains.  Tests will                be also made of hypotheses that different strains avoid direct                  competition by inhabiting spatially distinct sites or utilize                   different resources at the same physical site on leaves.",
