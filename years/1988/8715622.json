 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research deals with the continuation of previous                      studies on the toughening mechanisms in zirconia alloys.  The                   work will focus on two technically important systems with                       magnesia and ceria stabilizers, and will extend the previous                    microanalytical efforts, primarily via transmission electron                    microscopy, to include mechanical characterization and in situ                  studies of crack propagation.  The study will address the very                  important question of the R-curve behavior in these materials,                  which requires a close collaboration between mechanical testing                 and microanalytical procedures.                                                      The materials being investigated here, and the toughening                  mechanisms being evaluated are extremely important from a                       technological standpoint, as the zirconia alloys and derivatives                will have increasing number of applications in various  products.               Previous development of these materials has been largely                        empirical in nature, and development of a better scientific                     understanding of the toughening mechanisms in these systems would               greatly aid future development and applications.  The mechanisms                of toughening in these materials are quite complex, and                         understanding the details of these mechanisms requires careful                  and detailed scientific analysis of the materials and the                       processes occurring therein.",
