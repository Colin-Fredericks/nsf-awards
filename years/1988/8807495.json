 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project integrates and summarizes research that has                        compared men and women who are leaders or managers.  Using                      quantitative methods known as meta-analysis, these reviews                      represent each study's findings numerically (by means of a                      statistic called an effect size).  Statistical analyses are                     then performed on these numbers.  This project thus uses                        statistically correct methods for drawing conclusions from                      research rather than the informal rules-of-thumb that reviewers                 traditionally used.                                                                                                                                             One meta-analysis examines studies that compared women's and                    men's effectiveness as leaders.  The second meta-analysis                       examines studies in which the sex of leaders was varied while                   constraining their behavior to be equivalent.  These studies                    address the issue of whether male and female leaders are                        perceived differently even when their behavior is the same.                     These reviews complement two other meta-analyses being carried                  out by the principal investigator.  One of these other meta-                    analyses examines sex differences in leadership style and the                   other examines sex differences in the tendency to emerge as a                   leader in initially leaderless groups.  These four                              meta-analyses provide an exhaustive survey of leadership                        research that has compared the sexes.                                                                                                                           This project will summarize the findings of hundreds                            of leadership studies and provide empirically-grounded                          generalizations about male and female leadership behavior and                   its effects.  The project also has general implications for                     understanding sex differences in social behavior.  These                        implications stem from the fact that leadership research                        provides the only major body of studies in which female and                     male behavior has been compared in organizational settings as                   well as laboratory experimental settings.  A better                             understanding of sex differences in leadership is essential in                  light of recent and continuing demographic trends in                            organizational leadership.",
