 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Fuller is examining the attempts by the social sciences to                  establish their professional standards and disciplinary                         boundaries.  Dr. Fuller argues that the social sciences did this                by consciously imitating the examples of the natural sciences.                  In order to establish this position, Dr. Fuller will examine                    historical accounts of the debates over the scientific status of                the social sciences, especially anthropology, sociology,                        political science, economics and psychology.  He will use as                    sources the so-called canonical histories, namely, ones written                 by disciplinary practitioners with an eye toward justifying the                 course that the discipline's development has taken.  The success                of such histories necessarily involves the persuasive                           reconstruction of the past that is the purview of the                           rhetorician.  He will sample canonical histories of each of the                 disciplines from different periods in the last 100 years.   Dr.                 Fuller will undertake this study under the guidance of Dr. Donald               McCloskey, an economist who has pioneered the study of the role                 of rhetoric in the development of the social sciences.",
