 "awd_abstract_narration": "This supplementary program for grades 1-6 is designed to take advantage         of an existing vehicle, those basal science textbooks now in broad use,         to improve the quality and quantity of science being taught. The                materials described below will include correlations to those programs.                                                                                          A Science Discovery Reader for each grade level will introduce concepts         within the context of student experiences, and will be fun for children         to read. Critical thinking questions throughout these books will check          understanding of the concepts being taught, and teacher editions will           suggest additional activities and references.                                                                                                                   The Science Shoebox Recipe File will provide teachers with plans for            self-contained, hands-on activities. These activities will coordinate           with the plot and action of stories in the Science Discovery Reader.                                                                                            The Science Extension relates the concepts developed in the basal               textbook series and in the  Science Discovery Reader to other school            disciplines and to students' out-of-school environment.                                                                                                         Ancillary audio and video tapes will also be available.                                                                                                         Carolyn Sumners and Terry Contant, the Co-Principal Investigators, will         have the support of their own institution, the Houston Museum of Natural        Science, plus an array of university and school advisors, and a major           educational publisher. Silver, Burdett and Ginn publishing company will         provide strong staff and financial support, from development through            dissemination and teacher training, and assures potential for broad use         of this program in our schools.                                                                                                                                 Silver, Burdett and Ginn will provide support in the amount of                  $2,185,029.                                                                                                                                                     This proposal was submitted in response to the Program Solicitation,            \"Programs for Elementary School Science Instruction II,\" which                  encourages \"troika\" partnerships among publishers, school systems, and          scientists/science educators.",
