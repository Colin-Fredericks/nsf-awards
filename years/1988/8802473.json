 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program, Keyes will                   further develop the theory of light scattering from liquids and                 investigate several other aspects of nonequilibrium statistical                 mechanics.  These projects include development of a kinetic                     theory of transport, studying growth models and spinodal                        decomposition both analytically and on the computer, and                        studying light scattering from disordered systems.                                                                                                              In the theory of light scattering and in the theory of                          nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, the hardest problems,                     involving high density, large disorder, large spatial                           fluctuations, etc., will be attacked.  The powerful method of                   real-space renormalization will be directly applied to light                    scattering from disordered materials.  The possibility that                     light scattering from disordered systems need not probe                         averaged properties only, but may in fact give entire                           probability distributions and new information will be                           investigated.  The theory of diffusion in liquids will be                       advanced via application of methods developed under the                         previous grant.  These include the derivation of a kinetic                      equation which should describe liquids accurately, a                            variational method which seems well suited to its solution, and                 development of a new concept in the solution of kinetic                         equations, finding stochastic computer simulations which solve                  the equation.  An entirely new approach to transport theory in                  supercooled liquids, based upon the utilization of quantities                   derived from the force constant matrix, will be pursued.                        Several other projects in this broad line of research also will                 be pursued.",
