 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this program is to unify into a single                           coherent structure the various theoretical results that have                    been obtained on special models of the interaction of                           selection and recombination in populations.  By numerical and                   mathematical solutions of the equations of gametic frequency                    change and equilibrium, the various special cases of                            selection that have been explicitly solved up to the present                    time will be related by a continous deformation that                            connects them with general models of viability selection.                       Thus, for arbitrary selection regimes it will be possible to                    predict the equilibrium gametic structure when recombination                    is taken into account.  By solving the equations over the                       entire range of the variables, including a range outside the                    biologically realistic one, and then placing the \"window\" of                    biologically realistic limits of the values on the solutions,                   the selection/recombination dynamics for arbitrary selection                    values will be followed throughout the space of the selection                   and recombination parameters.  This is of considerable                          application because polymorphisms within very short linkage                     distances are now abundantly  demonstrated from DNA                             sequencing and restriction fragment studies.  The haplotypes                    in populations show considerable non-random association of                      sites, so a complete theoretical treatment of selection in                      the tightly linked systems is needed.                                                                                                                           This theoretical study should result in a general picture of                    the effect of natural selection on the genetic composition of                   a population when recombination is taken into account.",
