 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will describe how steroid binding to                 its receptor alters the equilibrium binding of the calf uterine                 estrogen and progesterone receptors to DNA.  The association                    constant for binding to DNA and the cooperativity of protein-DNA                interactions will be measured in the absence and presence of                    steroid hormones.  Association constants will be determined by                  using chromatography of each receptor over small DNA-Sepharose                  columns at a constant salt concentration.  The degree of                        cooperativity will be measured using \"salt back-titration\"                      analysis.  This is based on measuring the salt-dependence of                    protein-DNA binding at high concentrations of protein.  Free                    receptor and receptor bound to DNA will be separated by sucrose                 density gradient centrifugation and quantified by liquid                        scintillation counting of tritiated steroid.  By quantifying the                equilibrium binding of the estrogen and progesterone receptors to               DNA in the absence and presence of different ligands, these                     experiments will describe some of the conformational changes in                 steroid receptors which are induced by ligand binding.                               Estrogen and progesterone receptors are proteins which bind                steroid hormones.  Hormone binding to the receptor induces a                    conformational change in the receptor which, in turn, alters the                binding of the receptor to specific DNA sequences.  Binding of                  the receptor to DNA leads to alterations in the expression of                   specific genes.  The proposed quantitative studies of the                       interaction between the estrogen and progesterone receptors and                 DNA, and how DNA-binding of the receptors is altered by steroid                 binding will increase our basic understanding of the mechanisms                 by which gene expression is regulated by steroid hormones.",
