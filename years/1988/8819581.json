 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective is the development and use of an accurate                predictor of limb sophistication in fossil reptiles using gross                 spinal anatomy.  Such a tool will allow augmentation of functional              inferences based on limb osteology alone and allow predictions of               limb use when appendicular data is inadequate or absent.                                                                                                        A method of quantifying and standardizing variations in segmental               spinal cord area in living reptiles and birds has been                          accomplished with a spinal index.  Predictions of cord size based               on neural canal size are presently based on size relationships in               subadult Alligator specimens.  Improved ability to predict cord                 size in extinct reptiles will be accomplished by dissection and                 measurement of both cord and canal in additional ontogenetic                    stages and taxa.                                                                                                                                                Preliminary correlation of size of spinal index and sophistication              of limb use suggests that the index may be a sensitive indicator                of limb function.  Measurement of a much larger number of taxa                  displaying a greater spectrum of limb adaptations will allow finer              calibration of the spinal index.                                                                                                                                Application of data from living genera to the fossil record will                be obtained from museum collections.  Although applications of the              technique are wide and varied, only three specific questions of                 limb function in fossil reptiles are covered by this proposal.                  These involve forelimb use in theropods, role of torso and limb as              propulsive organs in aquatic tetrapods, and hindlimb/tail use in                armored dinosaurs.",
