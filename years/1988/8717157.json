 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding solar activity and solar flares remains one of               the most important unsolved problems in S/T research.  In recent                decades the rapid expansion in data gathering, particularly from                satellites and in the radio domain, has led both to a greater                   understanding and to a better appreciation of the complexity of                 the problem.  The basic causes of solar activity are now                        understood in broad terms.  The convective zone beneath the solar               photosphere is responsible for differential rotation and for the                generation of magnetic fields, whose rapid emergence through the                surface creates an active region.  A solar flare represents the                 sudden release of energy stored before the flare in the coronal                 region of the sun's atmosphere.  Energy may be stored as the free               energy of a current-carrying magnetic field.  The basic                         requirement of all flare models or magnetic field configurations                is that storage of energy must be in a metastable state: stable                 to small perturbations but unstable to large perturbations, which               lead to the impulsive release of stored energy.                                      The different flare models are characterized by specific                   magnetic field configurations in the corona, and by the explosive               reconnection of magnetic fields.  The theoretical magnetic field                configurations can be subjected to observational tests using                    intensity and polarization maps made with the VLA.  The high                    spatial resolution available with the VLA and the centimeter                    wavelengths at which the VLA operates are ideally suited for                    determining the magnetic field structures of the flaring region.                In particular, using radio waves of different wavelengths, one                  can explore different levels of the sun's atmosphere.  Radio                    observations are also unique in that they provide important                     information on the strength of the magnetic field in flaring                    regions.",
