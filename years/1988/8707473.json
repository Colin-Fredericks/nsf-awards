 "awd_abstract_narration": "By any standard, Vannevar Bush was one of the central figures of the            twentieth century.  An aggressive, young electrical engineer who                joined the staff of MIT in 1919, he rose through the ranks to become            in 1932 the Institute's first vice-president and dean of engineering.           In 1939, he moved to Washington to assume the presidency of the                 Carnegie Institution, one of the country's prestigious private                  foundations and sources of support for basic science.  However, the             threat of war quickly diverted his attention towards problems of a              different sort; in short order, Bush catapulted into the leadership of          the drive to mobilize science and engineering for the American war              effort.  The subsequent accomplishments of the National Defense                 Research Committee and the Office of Scientific Research and                    Development are well known, especially their managements of the                 projects that led to improved radars, the proximity fuse, synthetic             penicillin, and the atomic bomb.  These successes brought notoriety to          the scientific community and influence to Bush who played a key part            in the public debates and legislative battles that produced the Atomic          Energy Commission and the National Science Foundation.                                                                                                          Specifically, Dr. Owens' examination of Vannevar Bush, concentrating on         the period 1940-1955, illuminates his life and career during this               critical period during which important connections between American             engineering and the \"politics\" of American science emerged and enables          us to understand his significance in the wider context of American              History.  Dr. Owens study will make an important contribution to                understanding the great contemporary dilemmas that touch science,               political power, national security, and the contribution of technical           expertise to social progress.",
