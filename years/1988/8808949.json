 "awd_abstract_narration": "Complexity theory deals with how hard problems are.  Dr. Beigel's               research addresses the following question: When is it significantly             harder to solve k+1 instances of a problem than to solve only k                 instances?  The answer to this question is not obvious because there            are hard problems for which solving n instances is not much harder than         solving 1 instance.  Recently, various researchers have looked at the           number of queries that must be made to an oracle in order to solve a            problem as a measure of that problem's difficulty.  Counting oracle             queries provides a way of formalizing the main question posed in this           research and leads naturally to the definition of cheatable sets, p-            terse sets, and p-superterse sets.  The study of these sets makes it            possible to prove that it is significantly harder to solve k+1                  instances of certain kinds of important problems than k instances.  Dr.         Beigel is also investigating how these notions are related to other             important concepts in complexity theory.",
