 "awd_abstract_narration": "The area of Algorithm-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) for              ultra-high speed communications and signal processing systems is                currently the fastest growing segment of the semiconductor                      industry in the world.  The U.S. lead is eroding and may have                   already been surpassed by foreign competition.  Of the top five                 manufactures of ASIC in the world, three are Japanese.                               This award is funding an Industry/University Planning Meeting              to study the feasibility and viability of an Industry/University                Cooperative Research Center on Ultra-High Speed Integrated                      Circuits and Systems (ICAS) to be operated by the University of                 California, San Diego together with San Diego State University.                 The universities have drafted a prospectus for the Center's                     research and operations that will provide a basis of study at the               September 1988 meeting to be held in San Diego.  The co-principal               investigators and their colleagues are recognized experts in their              fields and have the necessary industrial interaction to run this                meeting.                                                                             The Program Manager recommends that the University of                      California, San Diego (along with San Diego State University) be                awarded a $9,000 grant for one year for an Industry Planning                    Meeting for an I/UCR Center on Ultra-High Speed Integrated                      Circuits and Systems.  Future funding will be based on a new                    proposal.",
