 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a workshop on the use of mathematical and computer models in            biological resource conservation.  It is designed to bring together an          interdisciplinary group of college teachers, in ecology and population          biology, biological resource management, and applied mathematics.  The          purpose of the workshop is to involve the participants in the techniques        of biological modeling, to enhance their effectiveness in presenting            modeling methods in the classroom, and to encourage the use of                  interdisciplinary modeling approaches to broad scientific questions.                                                                                            About 25 college and university faculty will participate in two                 sessions.  The main four-week session will be held in August, 1988, with        a one week follow-up session the following June.  During the intervening        academic year each participant will undertake an individual project at          his or her home institution, and these will be reported on and discussed        in the follow-up.                                                                                                                                               In the main four-week session, participants will be introduced to some          of the principal issues of conservation biology, and to modeling                techniques for their analysis.  The session will culminate in a group           modeling project, analyzing the conservation biology of the Black-Footed        Ferret.                                                                                                                                                         In addition to the NSF funds, participants' institutions will                   contribute about 15% in travel costs to the operation of the project.",
