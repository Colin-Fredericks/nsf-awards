 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Minnesota will develop and evaluate a model                   for upgrading the preparation of prospective elementary                         teachers in science and science teaching in the State of                        Minnesota.  Six pairs of faculty, one physical scientist, and                   one science educator, from Minnesota colleges will cooperate                    in a nine week workshop.  They will examine  theories of                        conceptual change, develop and teach a three week workshop                      for lead elementary school teachers from public and private                     schools near their home institutions, and develop plans for                     improving their own physical science and science methods                        courses.  The workshop will provide the opportunity for                         faculty to change their own conceptions of teaching science                     as they put new ideas into practice.  It will also produce a                    set of practicing elementary school teachers  who espouse the                   same philosophy who will be able to support preservice                          teachers during field experiences and student teaching.                         During the following two years, the faculty pairs will assist                   their local lead teachers in implementing changes in their                      own districts.  Similarly, they will be assisted by the                         project staff and each other as they plan and implement new                     courses in science and science methods for preservice                           teachers.  The efforts of the faculty pairs will be studied                     during a comprehensive evaluation that will reveal the                          strengths and weaknesses of the model.                                                                                                                          This project should improve the teacher preparation programs                    of six colleges and at the University of Minnesota.  In                         addition, it will influence how science is taught in                            elementary schools in the districts in which the colleges are                   located.  The total cost sharing for the project from school                    districts and from the University of Minnesota is $228,590 or                   31.5% of the total project cost.",
