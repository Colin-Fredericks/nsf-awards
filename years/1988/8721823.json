 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program, supported by the Organic and Macromolecular                       section covers a broad area of synthetic organic chemistry.The                  synthesis by multistep processes of several naturally occurring                 and biologically active complex organic molecules is under                      study.  Most of the molecules under study are of unusual                        interest because of their biological activities. Some may be of                 value in the development of new human therapeutic agents.  Hand                 in hand with the objective of achieving simple and effective                    syntheses of specific target structures is the development of                   new general synthetic organic reactions and methods and                         demonstrating their usefulness in the chosen multistep                          synthetic problems.  The discovery of such methods amplifies                    the power of synthesis and extends its range of application to                  ever more formidable structures.  In the course of this effort,                 a deeper appreciation of various fields of chemistry, e.g.                      organometallic chemistry and chemical theory, can be gained.                    In the area of multistep synthesis the following specific                       projects are being carried out:  (1)  synthesis of chiral C15                   gingkolides; bilobalide and analogs; (2) synthesis of chiral                    C20 gingkolides and analogs; (3) synthesis of kadsuranone and                   other antagonists of platelet activating factor (PAF ac ether,                  or simply PAF); (4) synthesis of preclavulone-A and more                        complex marine eicosanoids derived therefrom; (5) synthesis of                  pseudopterosin; (6) synthesis of glycinoeclepin; (7) synthesis                  of venustatriol; (8) synthesis of biotin; (9) synthesis of                      protosterol; (10) synthesis of tricyclohexaprenol.                                                                                                              In the areas of new synthetic methodology a number of projects                  are directed at the important problem of enantioselectivity in                  synthesis including the following:  (1) further studies to                      extend and broaden the important discovery of catalytic,                        enantioselective reductions by borane; (2) enantioselective 1,2                 -addition of carbon to aldehydes and ketones; (3)                               enantioselective conjugate addition of cuprates and other                       organometallic reagents to enones; (4) catalytic                                enantioselective cyclopropanation; (5) new chiral controller                    groups and reagents. Finally, a number of new methods will be                   studied which ultimately will lead to new and practical methods                 of oxidation, C-C bond formations, and ring formation reactions.",
