 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year project will address the difficulties presented by the            transition from junior to senior high school mathematics by enhancing           the mathematical and pedagogical skills of teachers in a setting which          fosters cooperation between teachers at the two levels.  Each year,             forty underprepared teachers -- half from grades 7 and 8, and half from         grade 9 -- will participate in a six-week summer workshop that includes         courses in probability and statistics, as well as a seminar on issues in        mathematics education.  Each junior high teacher will work jointly on a         project with a high school teacher.  The academic-year follow-up                consists of classroom visitations by the project staff and nine                 workshop-seminars for participants.                                                                                                                             The project will enable participants to use probability and statistics          as a means of reinforcing basic skills while developing their students'         higher-order thinking skills.  It also provides a model of constructive         interaction between junior and senior high school teachers.  The project        represents a collaboration between the University of Alabama at                 Birmingham and the Birmingham Public Schools, each of which contributed         significant cost-sharing to the project.",
