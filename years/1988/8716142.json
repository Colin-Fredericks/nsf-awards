 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports a U.S. scientists to spend a                sabbatical from his university at two prestigious academic                      institutions in India, namely the Indian Institute of Science (IIS)             in Bangalore, and the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in New               Delhi.  During that period Dr. Raman will continue his current                  collaborative research on planetary boundary layer (PBL), monsoon               dynamics and air pollution, with scientists from the Center for                 Atmospheric Sciences (CAS) at IIS Bangalore and at IIT Delhi.  He               will increase his work on tropical boundary structures over land for            both convective and stable conditions and monsoon dynamics.  He will            participate in the design of a three-year experiment at CAS for the             study of the boundary layer structure in the monsoon trough normally            located along the Gangetic plains during Indian southwest monsoon.              At Delhi he will conduct research on air pollution meteorology and              the work on PBL parameterization for Regional Scale Weather                     Forecasting Models.  His contacts are Professors R.N. Iyengar at CAS,           Bangalore and M.P. Singh at IIT Delhi.                                                                                                                          Scope:  The P.I. is one of the leading experts in the U.S. on                   modeling of tropical weather, especially as related to the Indian               subcontinent.  He has long experience in conducting research with               Indian scientists under several grants from NSF.  One of the Indian             collaborators (Dr. Iyengar) is Acting Head of the Center for                    Atmospheric Sciences at the Indian Institute of Science, one of                 India's top research institutes with excellent staff and facilities             and with well planned research agenda.  Dr. M.P. Singh at the Indian            Institute of Technology in New Delhi is the Director of the Center              for Atmospheric Sciences, and has a large staff engaged primarily in            atmospheric modeling and air pollution studies.  Drs. Singh and Raman           have been collaborating for several years on a project that involved            sending U.S. students for field studies in India.  This project has             the potential to produce significant results.",
