 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Accomplishment-Based Renewal award will enable Professor              Golledge and his collaborators to continue their research on how                children and adults acquire, process, and store information about new           geographical environments.  The purpose of this research is to                  determine how people acquire the knowledge they need to navigate in             cities and other areas.  Geographical knowledge acquisition and use for         navigation is analyzed in both field and laboratory settings.                        The previous work on this topic conducted by Professor Golledge            and his research team is highly regarded.  It has increased our                 understanding of how people identify landmarks, learn routes, and               integrate such knowledge into mental images of neighborhoods and                cities.  This award will permit the investigators to elaborate those            understandings.  Research findings resulting from this project have             important implications for theories and models of how children and              adults learn about spatial relationships generally and how they come to         mentally visualize local and larger areas.",
