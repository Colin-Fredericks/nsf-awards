 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general areas of analytical and surface                  chemistry and inorganic, bioinorganic, and organometallic                       chemistry and addresses the broad subfield of electron transfer                 processes.  Dr. Hupp, who is supported in the Inorganic,                        Bioinorgaqnic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program under NSF                   grant CHE-8710014 and who is also a Presidential Young                          Investigator awardee in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry                    Program, is focussing his research efforts on two areas.  The                   first involves the development and characterization of new,                     electroactive polymeric materials from which large dimension                    structural arrays will be prepared.  These assemblies should                    enable the three dimensional control of redox site distribution                 and are expected to be applicable in the technologically important              areas of imaging displays and electrocatalysis.  Dr. Hupp's second              research focus centers on mechanistic studies of photolytically                 and thermally induced electron transfer reactions.  These studies               are relevant to an enhanced understanding of light-driven energy                conversion processes, particularly those involved in                            photosynthesis.                                                                                                                                                 This present action provides funds for the acquisition of a                     spectrophotometer with which the ultraviolet, visible, and near-                infrared spectral characteristics of species involved in electron               transfer processes of interest to Dr. Hupp can be studied.  This                instrument will be extremely useful to both of Dr. Hupp's NSF-                  supported research activities.",
