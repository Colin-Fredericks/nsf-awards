 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past, we have proposed a knowledge base framework called                 Object-Oriented Knowledge Base (OOKB) which successfully combines               the concepts of deductive database, object-oreiented programming                and logic programming.  In this research, we propose to extend                  the framework of object-oriented knowledge base with an efficient               knowledge base management system.  In particular, we propose the                following research tasks:                                                                                                                                       Knowledge Management:  In our research, we propose the necessary                constructs to describe our knowledge (meta-knowledge) about the                 system-level objects such as integrity constraints, deductive                   laws, classes, methods, and transactions.  We also propose to                   employ the meta-level knowledge to ensure the quality of                        knowledge in a dynamic environment where knowledge is updated                   frequently and to facilitate to control of knowledge bases.                                                                                                     Query Processing/Optimization:  In the context of query                         processing, we propose a program transformation approach to avoid               exhaustive search.  The transformation system employs rewriting                 rules to substitute pieces of a query with some semantically                    equivalent sub-queries that can be solved more efficiently.                     Subsequently, the conjuncts in the transformed query are reorderd               dynamically to minimize the evaluation cost.                                                                                                                    Concurreny Control:  Coupled with the meta-knowledge constructs                 proposed in (a), we propose that concurrency control (among                     concurrent operations to knowledge as well as data) can be                      object-oreiented such that it can be customized according to the                semantics of objects.  Also, we classify the possible conflicts                 into six categoried and propose that concurrency control should                 be performed at knowledge level as well as object level.",
