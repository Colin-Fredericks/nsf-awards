 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator (PI) will continue research in                  areas of diagnosis of multi-processor systems at the system level               and of Very Large Systems Integration (VLSI) intermodule routing.               Research in the first area assumes a computing system consisting                of a large number of autonomous interconnected modules which have               the capability of testing one another to identify faulty modules.               The PI will continue his work in developing adaptive diagnostic                 algorithms with parallel testing to improve fault testing time in               this kind of system, modifying the Kuhl-Reddy algorithm which                   includes incomplete information refining a simple diagnosis                     algorithm for n-cube multi-processor computing systems, and                     analyzing the relationship between distributed diagnosis and the                Byzantine Agreement.                                                                 The PI also will explore the diagnosis of fault problems                   associated with \"corners\" in VLSI conducting paths that connect                 terminals on a chip.  This research will include developing                     improved approximation algorithms for special cases of the                      vertex-coloring problem of graph theory that can be applied to                  multiple-layer routing problems associated with designing and                   testing conducting paths.",
