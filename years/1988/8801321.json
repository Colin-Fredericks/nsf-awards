 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to defray room and board costs for participants            attending the West Coast Regional Developmental Biology Conference in           1988.  The conference is to be held at Asilomar, California, on March 6-        9. The meeting will include 24 invited speakers and a formal poster             session in which all attendees will be invited to present their results         and ideas.  The invited speakers include professors, postdoctoral               fellows and graduate students; three additional graduate student                speakers will be chosen at the meeting based on their poster                    presentations.  The general topic of the meeting is specification of            cell type and pattern; this will be subdivided into five sessions:                1. Specification of cell type and pattern by intracellular factors.             2. Specification of cell type and pattern by cell-cell contact or             proximity.                                                                        3. Specification of cell type and pattern by diffusible factors.                4. Genetic approaches to cell type and pattern specification.                   5.Cell type-specific gene regulation.                                            These meetings have provided important opportunities for                     developmental biologists at all levels to meet with their colleagues            within the region.",
