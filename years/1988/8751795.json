 "awd_abstract_narration": "The New York Hall of Science is the only major science center in the New        York Metropolitan Area and serves a rapidly growing audience with both          public and school-based programs and exhibits.  Low income families and         members of diverse minority communities are a major part of its target          audience.  The present award will support a major 3,000 square foot             permanent exhibition on microbiology and microscopic organisms organized        around themes of disease, its causes, prevention and cure, benign and           beneficial microbial agents, and the nature of microscopic life.  The           exhibition will make extensive use of new microscopic display                   technologies for interactive exhibitry, with extensive formative                evaluation and testing of principal exhibit components.  Professional           publications, an exhibit monograph and low cost videotapes will be used         in national dissemination and a classroom kit based on the exhibit will         be circulated widely throughout the New York Metropolitan area.                                                                                                 This innovative project will form a significant part of the permanent           exhibits of this newly reorganized science center.  NSF support will            constitute approximately 28% of the $ 1.3 million total project cost.",
