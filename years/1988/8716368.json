 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research  proposed by Dr. Horn will comprise                        experiments designed to further our understanding of why there                  are so few species of herbivorous fishes in temperate and high                  latitudes of the ocean as compared to much larger numbers in                    tropical waters.  The experiments will focus on the  1) role of                 seaweed toughness in dietary choice of temperate-zone herbivorous               fish,  2) growth of these fish on diets of varying protein                      content and  3) the effect of temperature on food processing                    efficiencies and metabolic requirements of these cold-water                     herbivores.  These experiments will test hypotheses that form the               essential elements of a model of temperate-zone fish herbivory.                 This model predicts that 1) only relatively inactive fish can                   meet their energy demands at low environmental temperatures on an               all-seaweed diet and therefore that 2) a seaweed diet is                        energetically feasible for more active fish only during the                     warmer periods of the year.  The fishes to be studied are two                   abundant inshore California species--a sluggish year-round                      herbivore (Cebidichthys violaceus) from the rocky intertidal zone               and an active, seasonal herbivore (Sebastes mystinus) from the                  adjacent kelp bed community.",
