 "awd_abstract_narration": "Entry of heated brines into foreland shelf sediments of the                US Midcontinent accompanied the Ouachita orogeny during the                     Pennsylvanian and Permian.  The water brought heat and possibly                 other constituents at the same time to promote diagenesis in                    foreland areas and contributed to formation of oil and mineral                  deposits.  A diagenetic scenario involving lateral motion of hot                water at shallow depths differs from most models.                                    This research will attempt to establish the importance of                  this regional heating for Middle and Late Pennsylvanian sandstones              and limestones in southeastern Kansas.  Earlier work has shown                  that limestones and sandstones there acted separately during late               diagenesis, forming baroque dolomite-like cements from                          constituents derived from different sources.  The proposed                      research will develop a diagenetic model for a small pilot area.                The model will assess the importance of regional events and local               controls in diagenesis of the area and will integrate diagenesis                and sandstones and limestones.                                                       Research will include optical, cathodoluminescence, and back-              scattered electron microscopy to investigate relations of                       diagenetic phases and stratigraphy of the cements.  Fluid                       inclusion, isotope, and trace-element data will establish                       conditions of diagenesis and sources of constituents.",
