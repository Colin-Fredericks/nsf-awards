 "awd_abstract_narration": "These experiments are designed to explore the exact routes by                   which hormones have their effects on behavior.  We know that the                hormones associated with reproduction have profound effects on                  the behavior of humans and other animals.  Dr. Schneider will                   work with steroid hormones that are produced during pregnancy and               have measurable effects on the maternal behavior of the female                  during pregnancy and after the birth of her offspring.                                                                                                          Dr. Schneider will use house mice for this project because during               pregnancy the female typically increases the size of her nest in                preparation for the birth of her offspring.  This increase in                   nesting behavior can be mimicked in a nonpregnant female by                     injecting her with the pregnancy steroid, progesterone.  Dr.                    Schneider believes that progesterone changes the mother's                       behavior by way of brain mechanisms that are also involved in the               regulation of body temperature.  (House mice give birth all year                round, even during cold winters, and their young are born without               the ability to maintain their own body temperature.)  To unravel                the connection between the regulation of body temperature and the               control of maternal behavior, Dr. Schneider will (1) measure                    nesting, maternal care, and body temperature in mice that have                  progesterone implants in very precise brain areas to show where                 there may be overlap among the brain mechanisms controlling                     maternal behavior and temperature regulation, and (2) test the                  effects of a variety of steroids in these brain sites to see if                 the same ones influence both maternal nesting and body                          temperature.  Dr. Schneider will also measure the levels of                     steroids in the blood to find out if the action of progesterone                 on the brain changes the secretion of naturally occurring                       steroids from the ovaries or adrenal glands.                                                                                                                    Dr. Schneider's research will help to show how hormones prepare                 the mother for the birth and care of her offspring.  More                       generally, these studies may provide a better understanding of                  the mechanisms by which steroid hormones (commonly prescribed for               a variety of reasons: birth control, infertility, menopause,                    allergies) produce their primary and side effects on human                      behavior and physiology.",
