 "awd_abstract_narration": "The capability of modern instrumentation in materials science                 to provide large quantitative arrays of experimental data is                    outstripping the ability of many computer systems to analyze the                data.  The acquisition of this computer equipment will provide a                computing environment which will allow the full exploitation of                 the capabilities of advanced instrumentation.  It is designed,                  as well, to provide maximally effective access of the system                    users to the Cornell Production Supercomputer Facility.                         Anticipated use of the system includes work in ultra-high vacuum                scanning transmission electron microscopy, conventional very high               resolution transmission electron microscopy, scanning tunneling                 microscopy, near field scanning optical microscopy, optical                     sectioning and fluorescence microscopies, hyperthermal ion beam                 studies of surfaces, time resolved x-ray diffraction, and                       nanosecond resolved measurements of rapid melting and                           solidification.  In some of the applications the advanced                       computing capability will be used to extend the capabilities of                 standard techniques (e.g. image enhancement in electron                         microscopies); in others, the computation is a critical aspect of               the development of fundamentally new experimental techniques                    (e.g. near field and optical sectioning microscopies).                            Clearly, this capability will significantly enhance a number of               research projects supported by the Division of Materials                        Research.",
