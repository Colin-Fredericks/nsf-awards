 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reconstruction of an ecological system on a seriously                      disturbed arid site has been studied for six years in the context               of current ecological theory. The objectives have been to test a                number of ecological hypotheses, particularly regarding                         succession, and to develop methods for projecting the                           consequences of different management alternatives.  A series of                 controlled experiments has been performed on a surface coal mine                in southwestern Wyoming, and data have been collected on                        vegetation, soils, fungi, meteorology, invertebrates, and                       vertebrate wildlife succession on the sites.  During this final                 project phase the investigators will complete data analyses,                    synthesize data into major research publications and disseminate                information to a variety of user groups in both theoretical and                 applied fields.  Modeling efforts will integrate the study and                  result in the creation of a projection tool designed to indicate                the consequences of different management actions on site                        dynamics.                                                                            Project output should be of great importance in a                          fundamental ecological sense as well as to land resource managers               and to those involved in spoil land reclamation.                                     The institution continues to provide excellent support and                 facilities for the work.  The project team remains intact and                   excellent in its team efforts.",
