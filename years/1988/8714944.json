 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in the                                 mathematical analysis of interacting particle systems                           between a group of U.S. scientists headed by Joel Lebowitz                      of Rutgers University and five Brazilian mathematicians:                        E.D. Andjel, P.A. Ferrari, J.A. Galves and R.H. Schonmann                       of the Universidade de Sao Paulo and M.A. Vares of the                          Instituto de Matematica Pura e Aplicada (IMPA) of CNPq in                       Rio de Janeiro. The researchers will continue and                               strengthen a five year long collaboration in the analysis                       of interacting particle systems and their hydrodynamical                        limits, an active field of research in mathematics and                          physics. These latter limits relate interacting particle                        systems to hydrodynamical partial differential equations                        and are useful in understanding those equations.                                                                                                                This collaboration has been very fruitful, resulting in the                     publication of at least eleven papers on interacting                            particle systems.  The original motivation for this field                       arose from stochastic mechanics where the objective was to                      use probabilistic models in the study of the temporal                           evolution of systems with classical equilibrium states.                         Such models appear naturally, for example, as algorithms                        for making  Monte Carlo simulations of Gibbs measures.  It                      soon became clear that the same techniques could also be                        applied to models from biology, ecology, and the behavioral                     sciences.  Future work by the researchers will center on                        obtaining more information about interacting systems,                           including relating microscopic and macroscopic                                  fluctuations, extending previous results to the case where                      large deviations with unusual scalings are expected, and                        applying these results to more general settings, for                            example, particles moving under deterministic dynamics and                      interacting Brownian motions or random walks.",
