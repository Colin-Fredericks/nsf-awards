 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program is in the area of organometallic                              photochemistry. The results are expected to answer important                    questions concerning the mechanisms of light-induced reactions                  of organometallic compounds and may also provide useful                         methodology for the synthesis of thin films of organometallic                   compounds.                                                                                                                                                      The focus of the project is photochemical and thermal arene                     replacement reactions of transition metal complexes. New laser                  dye complexes of CpRu(+) and Cp(*)Ru(+) will be synthesized,and                 the emission and photochemical properties of these new                          chromophores will be investigated. Mechanistic studies of arene                 release from CpRe(arene), from CpMn(biphenyl) and from                          bis(arene)Re(+) will focus on the importance of hapticity                       changes in the photochemical and thermal reactions of                           metal-arene and related compounds. The differences between                      photochemical and thermal arene displacement will be                            investigated by kinetic studies and through spectroscopic                       identification of reaction intermediates. Reaction                              intermediates will be characterized using rapid scan diode                      array and FT-IR spectrometers. Flash photolysis studies will be                 initiated to measure the kinetics of metal-arene dynamics by                    transient absorption and emission lifetime measurements. The                    mechanism of epoxide polymerization by CpFe(arene)+ complexes                   to produce thin films will be studied, and this reaction will                   be extended to produce chiral polymers by using chiral iron                     complexes as the photochemically active species.",
