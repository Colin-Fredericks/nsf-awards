 "awd_abstract_narration": "The entomological collections at the Academy of Natural                    Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP) contain over three million insect               specimens from around the world.  It is a world center for                      systematic research on orthopterans (grasshoppers, crickets and                 their relatives).  The collection contains over 10,000 type                     specimens, including some of the earliest-described and commonest               species of insects.                                                                  At the current rate of growth, all storage space will soon                 be filled.  Presently, compactors occupy about 2/3 of the                       existing floor space, and this project will allow                               compactorization of the remaining collection, thus allowing a 25%               increase in storage capacity.                                                        The ANSP houses one of the larger collections of insects                   preserved in alcohol and on slides.  The greater part of this                   collection consists of aquatic insects, especially members of the               family Chironomidae (midges).  These flies, as well as the other                aquatic groups, constitute an important element of the freshwater               fauna and have been used as reliable indicators of water quality.               Curation of this collection has lagged relative to to other                     portions of the collection and a large part of it must be                       rehoused and properly curated.  This project will provide a                     curatorial assistant to accomplish this task under the guidance                 of Dr. Selwyn Roback, who assembled most of the collection and                  will be retiring soon.  In addition, a half-time curatorial                     assistant will be provided to work on the large alcoholic                       collection of spiders, mites and centipedes and on the Peale                    Collection, a separately maintained collection of butterflies and               moths that has scientific, artistic and historical value.",
