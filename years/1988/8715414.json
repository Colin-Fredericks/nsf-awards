 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      Robert K. Cheng of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory of the                      University of California, Berkeley, and Dr. I. Gokalp of the                    Centre de Recherches sur la Chimie de la Combustion et des                      Hautes Temperatures (CRCCHT) of CNRS, in Orleans, France.  The                  work will focus on an investigation of the fundamental                          properties of premixed turbulent flames stabilized in stagnation                point flows.  This particular flame configuration is considered                 ideal for testing numerical models of turbulent combustion,                     because its behavior closely approximates that of an idealized                  one-dimensional flame.  Two different types of flame                            configurations will be studied:  in California, the planar                      turbulent flame brush formed by the impinging of a flame on a                   flat plate; and in France, opposing flame jets.                                                                                                                 Both the French and American groups share the same approach to                  the study of turbulent flame dynamics, employing laser                          diagnostics to measure detailed statistical turbulence                          parameters.  The proposed collaboration will multiply the number                of types of flame configurations that can be studied using these                techniques.  The U.S. and French investigators have been                        collaborating informally for the last two years, and this                       collaboration has already resulted in two joint publications.                   Travel support provided by this grant will facilitate the                       continuation of this work, which has important practical                        ramifications in the design of high-efficiency apparatus, such                  as gas or oil burners, which utilize flames.",
