 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major goal of avian ecologists has been to quantify and                  explain patterns of species co-occurrence and community                         structure.  Until recently, most emphasis in this area was placed               on birds at temperate latitudes during the breeding season.                     However, because species may be subjected to the most stringent                 selective pressures during the nonbreeding seasons (winter and                  migration), ecologists in the 1980s have emphasized a year-round                approach to the study of bird community structure and foraging                  ecology.  In addition to those theoretical considerations, the                  unfortunate destruction of native tropical vegetation creates a                 need for immediate action to assess effects of habitat alteration               on overwintering migrant and resident bird species.  This study                 investigates a number of unresolved problems in neotropical bird                ecology on wintering grounds and in migration.  Specifically,                   effects of: (1) vegetation structure, (2) food resources, (3)                   presence of hetero- and conspecifics, and (4) season on the                     foraging ecology of and habitat use by migrant wood-warblers in                 Belize, Central America, and Tennessee will be assessed.                        Simultaneous quantification of the above variables will provide                 insight into their effects at the individual, population, and                   community levels.  Integration of these results can elucidate the               year-round ecological constraints imposed on populations of                     migrant neotropical birds that breed in temperate areas.",
