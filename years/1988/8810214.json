 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a fundamental study of crystallization of biological compounds          by the addition of organic non-solvents.  The reserch encompasses a             study of solubilities of eight model amino acids and two model                  antibiotics under different environmental conditions, and the data              will be used to formulate a theoretical model based on UNIFAC.  A               second study is on the kinetics of nucleation and crystal growth by a           micro interferometric technique.                                                                                                                                The development of a model describing the solubilities of complex               molecules, of the type to be studied in the proposed research, would            lead to significant advances in understanding the behavior of such              systems, and it should be of great value in understanding key factors           influencing the production of certain pharmaceutical and specialty              chemicals in general.",
