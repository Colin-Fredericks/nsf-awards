 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Paul                 Cox, Brigham Young University and Dr. Lars Bohlin, University of                Uppsala, Sweden.  The principal objective of the joint work is to               perform a comprehensive pharmacological screen of the medicinal                 plants of Samoa.  The Polynesians have significantly exploited                  their island plants for the development of an indigenous system of              ethnopharmacology.  In this joint project, the U.S. team headed by              Dr. Cox will be responsible for interviewing Samoan healers,                    recording their plant lore, collecting and identifying all                      medicinal plants used by them, and for the preparation of crude                 extracts.  The Swedish team headed by Bohlin will examine the                   extracts for pharmacological activity using both in vivo and in                                                                  __ ____     __                 vitro general and specific screens.  Crude extracts showing                     _____                                                                           pharmacological activity will be fractionated, and specific                     fractions responsible for the activity will be isolated.  The                   Swedish team will also prepare extracts for future structural                   determination.                                                                                                                                                  This international and interdisciplinary collaboration should                   provide a model for future ethnopharmacological investigations and              may potentially result in the discovery of new compounds with novel             pharmacological activity.",
