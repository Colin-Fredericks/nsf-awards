 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seven courses in the biology curriculum have been targeted for             inclusion of a molecular physiology component, both because of the role         played by molecular physiology in modern biology, and because these             seven courses involve both majors and non-majors at all levels of               undergraduate education.  Two spectrophotometers with flowcell,                 thermoelectric cell, and recorder interface, and one strip chart                recorder now are enabling students (a) to perform experiments in enzyme         and transport kinetics, (b) to conduct a variety of metabolic studies,          and (c) to pursue aspects of molecular physiology in their independent          research projects.                                                                                                                                              These experiences better inform undergraduate students about                    comtemporary biology and better prepare majors for advanced studies,            teaching careers, and professional work.  The grantee institution is            matching the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal              sources.",
