 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will investigate the factors promoting               variation in the size and organization of the bacterial                         chromosome.  By analysing isolates of Escherichia coli and other                enteric bacteria of known genetic and genealogical relationships,               he will examine many types of evolutionary events occurring above               the level of individual gene loci.  This research will address                  questions concerning: (1) the incidence of horizontal gene                      exchange, recombination and large-scale DNA rearrangements in                   natural populations, (2) variation in the physical maps of the E.               coli chromosome, (3) the extent of insertion and deletion of                    chromosomal DNA causing variation in genome size among natural                  isolates, (4) the chromosomal location and stability of                         transposable elements, and (5) the rate and evolutionary history                of genetic and chromosomal changes in enteric bacteria.                              To analyse these events among natural isolates, Dr. Ochman                 will:  (1) Assess the nucleotide variation in a large number of                 genes positioned around the E. coli chromosome to search for                    regions that have been affected by recombination, as evident by                 inconsistencies in the phylogenetic relationships among strains                 based on a particular gene.  (2) Produce physical maps of the                   chromosome for many strains of E. coli.  Large DNA fragments                    generated by restriction enzymes with very infrequent recognition               sequences are resolved by techniques such as pulsed-field gel                   electrophoresis and mapped by blot and hybridization procedures.                (3) Compare homologous traits- nucleotide sequences and physical                maps - among divergent taxa.  In total, these methods provide a                 broad approach to studying the dynamics of the bacterial genome.//",
