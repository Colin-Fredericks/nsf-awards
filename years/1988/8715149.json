Chanzy of the Centre de Recherche sur les                                       Macromolecules Vegetales, of CNRS in Grenoble, France,                          in the area of molecular imaging of organic                                     materials.  These materials are easily destroyed by                             the electron beams used in imaging inorganic                                    materials.  Therefore, special imaging techniques must                          be developed, which utilize low-energy beams without                            sacrificing resolution.  The objective of this work is                          to increase the resolution with which                                           electron-beam-derived molecular images of plant                                 polysaccharides can be obtained.  Electron-beam images                          will be produced, using the electron microscope at the                          collaborating French institution; the images will then                          be enhanced, using image-processing algorithms                                  developed by the U.S. investigator.  Laser                                      interferometry will be used to obtain parallel data on                          molecular structure in order to check the algorithms                            developed.                                                                                                                                                      The capabilities of the two laboratories and                                    investigators are complementary, with equipment and                             expertise for electron-beam imaging already available                           in France and image-processing expertise in the U.S.                            The techniques to be developed in France will be                                transferred to the U.S. laboratory, where they will be                          available for later use by the U.S. investigator in                             his studies of plant polymers.  These techniques will                           also be useful for the study of other beam-sensitive                            materials, such as viral samples or polymeric                                   photoresists.",
