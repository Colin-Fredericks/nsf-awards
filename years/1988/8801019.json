 "awd_abstract_narration": "In contemporary African nations, men and women often adapt                 differently to the post-colonial world.  While much is known                    about male responses, women's institutional responses have                      received less attention.                                                             To remedy this situation, the researcher will look at Hausa                female healers who belong to the Bori possession cult in Niger.                 She will analyze cultural, social, and health related aspects in                order to discover how the cult has historically adapted to recent               changes in Niger.  This research will establish how increasingly                women in West African societies utilize health related voluntary                associations in order to stabilize their social and power                       positions in rapidly changing situations.                                            Women are a major economic and social force in Hausa                       society.  Hausa cultural influence is pervasive and extends                     beyond Niger, from Nigeria to Egypt.  Understanding the behavior                of Hausa women is thus crucial to understanding all of northern                 Africa.",
