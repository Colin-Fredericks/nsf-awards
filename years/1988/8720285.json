 "awd_abstract_narration": "A coordinated theoretical and observational program to study the                relation between hydrodynamic and particle acceleration processes               in extended radio sources will be carried out.  This program is a               scientific and technical extension of past research which has                   contributed significantly to the empirical and physical                         understanding of compact and extended radio sources.                                                                                                            A new class of numerical simulations will be carried out, in which              results of microphysics calculations of particle acceleration in                shocks and turbulence will be incorporated, for the first time,                 into state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations.  The goals of                 the simulations include a better understanding of particle                      acceleration in astrophysical contexts as well as improved insight              into the relationships between radio source surface brightness and              the internal dynamics of the sources.  The observational program                will study the dependence of synchrotron emissivity on the                      inferred pressures in extended radio source shocks, and will                    let scientists search for and examine other features expected from              the simulations.  A unique view of the dynamics/emissivity                      relation will be produced through observations of the evolution of              knots in the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant.",
