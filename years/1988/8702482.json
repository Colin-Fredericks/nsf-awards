 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seaver Engineering Associates proposes to develop an                    expendable optical sensing system to measure oceanic depth and                  temperature (an optical bathythermograph, BT).                                          The commercial development of the expendable                            bathythermograph (XBT) in the 1960s began a revolution in the                   process of making oceanographic measurements.  The XBT alleviated               the need for a ship to stop at a location and laboriously lower                 and raise an instrument while recording, on deck, the                           measurements as they were transmitted up the electrical winch                   wire.  The XBT is merely thrown overboard while a ship is                       underway and its data is tramsmitted up a thin expendable wire.                 The ship never stops and, as a consequence, becomes far more                    efficient, dramatically reducing the time per measurement and                   increasing the quantity of data.  Literally hundreds of thousands               of XBT measurements are now taken every year.                                           The proposal by Seaver is to develop an optical expendable              BT.  Optics have a number of advantages over standard                           electromechanical measurement devices intended for ocean use                    including high data rates, low attenuation, light weight, non-                  corrosible, and unaffected by electrical grounding. Further, with               costs for optical fiber continually dropping, it is quite likely                that an optical system will become cheaper than present systems.                        Seaver demonstrated the feasibility of an optical pressure              and temperature sensor in Phase I of Small Business Innovation                  Research (SBIR) Program.  This proposal, for Phase II SBIR                      funding, is to develop a prototype instrument and to calibrate                  and test it.",
