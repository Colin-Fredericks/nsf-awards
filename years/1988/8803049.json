 "awd_abstract_narration": "This experimental and numerical research is in the area of thermal              processing.  The investigation will study the effects of the coupling           between the conduction in the material and the convective fluid flow,           the contributions of the boundary conditions at an upstream of the              point of emergence of the of the material, the augmentation by                  buoyancy forces in the fluid and by radiative loss, and the influence           of turbulence.  Interest also lies in the heat transfer rate at the             surface, the downstream temperature decay and the effect of the                 important physical variables such as material velocity, temperature             levels and material and fluid properties.  These aspects are important          in the simulation of the process and in the optimization, control and           design of the relevant physical system.  The results obtained will              contribute to a basic understanding of the underlying physical                  processes and will provide important inputs for improving and                   designing practical materials processing systems.                                                                                                               In a wide variety of applications related to the thermal processing of          materials, such as extrusion, rolling and continuous casting,                   continuously moving materials subjected to heat transfer environments           are encountered.  In many cases, the motion of the material itself              generates the fluid flow for the thermal transport and this is the              circumstance proposed for detailed experimental and numerical                   investigation in this research effort.  Though the problem is of                considerable practical and fundamental importance, little detailed              study has been undertaken to answer many of the basic issues that               arise and to provide the relevant inputs for process design.",
