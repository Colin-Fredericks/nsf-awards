 "awd_abstract_narration": "Behavioral studies carried out over the last 20 years indicate                  that many, perhaps most, types of animals detect the earth's                    magnetic field and use this source of directional information to                guide their movements.  Remarkably, however, among higher animals               and, in particular, land-dwelling vertebrates, the way in which                 the magnetic field is detected has not been determined.                                                                                                         Recent studies of the Eastern newt have shown that this                         salamander is an especially good subject for studying magnetic-                 field sensitivity because it exhibits much stronger responses to                earth-strength magnetic fields in the laboratory than have been                 observed for other vertebrates.  Furthermore, the Eastern newt                  exhibits two types of magnetic responses with different                         properties, suggesting that two different magnetoreception                      systems may be involved.                                                                                                                                        Dr. Phillips will carry out behavioral experiments designed to                  elucidate the sensory mechanism(s) responsible for detection of                 the earth's magnetic field.  Specifically, these experiments will               test the hypothesis that the Eastern newt has two different                     magnetoreception systems:  one system utilizing small particles                 of the mineral magnetite that act like tiny compass needles and a               second system that relies on specialized visual receptors that,                 in effect, \"see\" the magnetic field.  Determining how vertebrates               detect the earth's magnetic field and, in particular, whether the               visual system plays a role in this sensory capability is of                     considerable importance to our understanding of the detection and               processing of sensory information by vertebrates, including man.",
