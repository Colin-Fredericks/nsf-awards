 "awd_abstract_narration": "Contemporary high-frequency electromagnetic engineering problems                can involve full-vector wave interactions with complex,                         electrically-large, three-dimensional structures.  Numerical                    simulation of Maxwell's equations for such structures is of great               importance since the classical analytical tools for                             electrodynamics cannot deal with vector near fields that may be                 almost arbitrarily complex.                                                                                                                                     Two of the primary contemporary thrusts in numerically modeling                 such problems are:  (1) the frequency-domain integro-differential               equation approach with solution via the method of moments (MON);                and (2) the time-domain partial differential equation approach                  with solution via the finite-difference time-domain (FD-TD)                     method.  This research project will develop Connection Machine                  (CM) software for the latest versions of MOM and FD-TD, construct               benchmarks relative to Cray-based versions, and develop scaling                 rules for CM processing of ultra-large near-field data bases.                   This project will also extend a new spatial decomposition (SD)                  technique to the latest combined-field surface integral equation                versions of MOM.  SD is very promising for reducing the                         dimensionality and ill-conditioning of large MOM problems, and                  may permit existing computers to process very large EM models.",
