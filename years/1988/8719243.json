 "awd_abstract_narration": "An \"International Cloud Modelling Workshop\" will be held in                Toulouse, France on August 8-12, 1988.  This is the second                      workshop in a series with the primary goal being to promote                     constructive interaction between scientists working on theory,                  numerical models and those working with observations.                                The focus of this workshop will be on cloud microphysics and               participation will involve two phases.  First of all,                           participants will carry out numerical experimentation at their                  home institutions using data provided by the workshop organizers.               During the Workshop in Toulouse, participants will meet to                      compare model results against observations and against other                    modeling efforts.                                                                    The purpose of this award is to ensure participation of a                  strong contingent of US scientists at the meeting.  Selection of                recipients of travel support will be made upon the recommendation               of a panel of experts including representatives of the American                 Meteorological Society Committees on Weather Modification and                   Cloud Physics as well as members of the United States Workshop                  Organizing Committee.",
