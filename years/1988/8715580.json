 "awd_abstract_narration": "Consolidation is a process in which water is squeezed out of soils as           a function of time, with a resultant reduction in soil volume.  The             resulting problems involve time dependent settlement of buildings,              tanks, embankments, fills, and other \"structures.\"  In case of                  dredged materials and waste \"slimes\" from the mining industry, the              problem is usually that there are huge quantities of waste material             that we wish to concentrate to a smaller volume through the                     consolidation process.  \"Design\" involves predicting the rate of                consolidation so ample storage areas can be planned and used                    efficiently.  Classical analyses involve grossly simplifying                    assumptions and have limited accuracy, requiring that the answers be            adjusted using \"engineering judgment.\"  In this proposal, the PI                proposes research to develop analytical methods that account for                large strains, multidirectional water flow, and other such effects,             thus allowing realistic solutions to problems involving efficient and           economical disposal of such materials.",
