 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I                          project is in the general area of organic and                                   macromolecular chemistry and in the subfield of organic                         synthesis.  This research focusses on the development of                        efficient, chemical ways to introduce biotin into synthetic                     DNA fragments such that they can be subsequently detected                       with the streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase signaling                            system.  This nonradioactive DNA hybridization probe has                        several advantages over the radioactive labeling techniques                     currently in use including much longer shelf life, greater                      convenience and safety, high detectability, and the                             capability for automated analyses.  Such synthetic                              biotinylated oligonucleotides of mixed sequences can be                         used directly as hybridization probes for the rapid                             identification and isolation of specific genes.  The                            sensitivity of the method for the visual detection of the                       hybridized probes is sufficiently high that 0.5 femtomoles                      of plasmid DNA should be detectable.  The chemical                              synthesis of biotinylated DNA fragments will be carried out                     by the solid phase phosphoramidite method.                                                                                                                      The development of these biochemical probes should have                         significant impact on biomedical research and could find                        broad applications in the diagnosis of genetically                              determined conditions such as viral diseases and cancers.                       Whereas this Phase I activity focusses on oligonucleotides                      labeled with biotin, it should be possible to subsequently                      examine other types of nonradioactive labeling systems                          (e.g., fluorescent probes, electron spin resonance probes,                      photoaffinity labels) with potential applications in                            biochemical research.",
