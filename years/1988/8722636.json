 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of the initiation and growth mechanisms of                      filamentous carbon on nickel, cobalt, and the alloys of nickel,                 cobalt, and iron.  Computer.generated phase diagrams are used to                control solid \"surface\" and bulk compositions.  The gas phase                   consists of mixtures of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane,               hydrogen, and water.  Experiments are performed in an isothermal,               differential, gravimetric reactor.  Filament and solid structures               are observed using electron microscopy along with metallurgical                 etching.  Solid.phase identification is performed using X.ray                   and/or electron diffraction and magnetic susceptibility                         measurements.  Laser interferometry and laser speckle metrology                 are used to generate low.temperature \"surface\" phase diagrams and               explore crystalline orientation effects on filament initiation                  and growth.                                                                                                                                                     Carbon filaments grow as a result of catalytic decomposition of                 carbon.bearing gases on iron, nickel, or cobalt, or their alloys.               These filaments can be used in high.strength, low.weight                        composites.  However, they are also a serious corrosion problem                 for many transition.metal.based alloys and catalysts.",
