 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Grayson and his assistant will analyze archaeological faunal                remains excavated from the site of Le Flageolet I, which is                     located in the Perigord region of France.  Years of careful                     excavation at the site have revealed a series of superimposed                   cultural layers which are rich in animal remains as well as stone               tools.  Nine of these layers contain Aurignacian and Perigordian                cultural materials, the earliest of which are approximately                     35,000 years old, and thus, date to the last part of the most                   recent Ice Age.  These cultural layers document the first                       appearance of anatomically modern humans in Europe.  The team                   will analyze the faunal remains with innovative techniques to                   determine the extent to which these Paleolithic peoples obtained                animal food through hunting as opposed to scavenging.                                                                                                           Recent arguments maintain that the preceding Middle Paleolithic                 peoples were dependent on scavenging to obtain the flesh of at                  least larger mammals.  This position holds that fully efficient                 hunting did not emerge until about 35,000 years ago and that this               ability emerged as part of the complex of characteristics that                  marks behaviorally modern peoples.  While several Middle                        Paleolithic faunal series have been studied, they do not answer                 the question because no comparable assemblages younger than                     35,000 years have been analyzed.  This research will provide the                first such sample.                                                                                                                                              This research is important because it will increase our                         understanding of the forces which shaped human development.  Many               anthropologists have argued that humans evolved as hunters and                  that the skills necessary to hunt form an essential part of human               behavior and shaped its development.  Others believe that such is               not the case and that such hunting is relatively recent.  This                  research addresses the issue and thus, should shed light on the                 process which made us human.",
