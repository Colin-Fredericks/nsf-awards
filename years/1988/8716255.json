The objective of the investigation is to                     prepare superconducting alkaline earth-rare earth copper oxides                 via sol-gel synthetic techniques, and to study the physical                     properties of the materials made by this technique as compared                  with materials prepared via high temperature solid state                        reactions.  Sol-gel techniques involve the polycondensation of                  solution-phase metal complexes to form inorganic networks which                 ultimately form a gel.  Gels can be heated to relatively low                    temperatures (400 to 800\u001aC) to form metal oxide glasses or                      crystalline phases.  The program will emphasize study of gel                    evolution with temperature to form glasses and crystalline phases               using nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared spectroscopy, electron               spin resonance techniques, differential scanning calorimetry,                   thermal gravimetric analysis, and x-ray diffraction, as well as                 characterization of the properties of the specimens by measuring                electrical conductivity, and ac and dc magnetic susceptibility.                                                                                                      Advantages of sol-gel processing over solid state processing               include lower reaction temperatures, greater homogeneity, purity                and compositional control, and the ability to cost gels into                    various forms and shapes prior to final heating.  In the case of                superconducting oxides, these advantages will yield materials                   having higher quality and will allow fabrication into useful                    shapes.",
