 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry                  Program, Ronis is developing new statistical mechanic theories                  for static and dynamic properties of condensed systems.  This                   project involves a diverse set of topics ranging from                           developing theories of phase transitions and critical phenomena                 in condensed media to modelling micelles, membranes and                         biological systems such as gramicidin-A.                                                                                                                        Ronis is developing new and extending existing theories in                      statistical mechanics to static and dynamic problems in                         condensed systems.  The immediate goals are 1) to study the                     effects of solvent and backbone flexibility on time correlation                 functions which determine the  alkali-ion permeability in                       gramicidin-A; 2) to calculate the ionic potential of mean force                 near the mouth of a model gramicidin-A/membrane pore system; 3)                 to develop an improved theory of the ionic double layer near                    highly charged polarizable surfaces; 4) to extend his                           microscopic theory of membrane transport to diffusive transport                 in zeolites; 5) to study the effect of inter-particle                           correlations on phase transitions and size distributions in                     ionic micellar suspensions; 6) to develop a kinetic theory of                   binary mixture phase transitions in porous media; 7) to improve                 his theory of critical phenomena in turbulent flows by solving                  a self-consistent theory of the coupling of critical dynamics                   to the fluid motion flow; 8) to develop a theory of instability                 mechanisms and fluctuations in colloidal crystals; 9) to                        develop a theory of enhanced radiative energy transfer in small                 particles; and 10) to develop a theory of spinodal                              decomposition near the critical point.",
