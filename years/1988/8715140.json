 "awd_abstract_narration": "The region from 65 km to 95 km altitude is known as the                    mesosphere and the ionization produced in it by absorption of                   solar ultraviolet is known as the D region.  The ions and                       electrons initially produced are more likely to associate with                  molecules than is the case at higher altitudes, on account of the               higher ambient air densitites and smaller fractions of molecules                broken down to atomic form at those altitudes, as compared to the               most dense region of the ionosphere at say 200 km.  The chemical                reactions occurring are complex and not as well understood as at                higher altitudes.  The electron densitites are lower than at                    higher altitudes, and very low at night, so that one does not get               a strong return with radar.  Nevertheless, the region is                        important as an absorbing medium for transmission of radio waves,               and its ion chemistry and temperature and turbulence structure                  can be studied at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, and comparisons made with               complex models of the chemistry.  This award is to perform such                 measurements and to analyze more fully the results of previous                  measurements.",
