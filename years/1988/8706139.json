Areas studied are design aids for VLSI and VLSI                algorithms.  In the former the principal investigator studies                   optimal algorithms, heuristics, and multiple solutions for the                  rectilinear Steiner minimal tree problem.  He is also pursue new                questions in his study of optimal parallel prefix circuits.                     These include:  extending the class over which he can optimize,                 finding new applications of the parallel prefix method of                       computation and adapting the optimizer to an existing design                    tool.  In VLSI algorithms, he is continuing his investigation of                finding circuit algorithms that are worth being cast into                       silicon.  This is an expansion of his 1-selection algorithm work,               and includes lower bound proofs of algorithms.",
