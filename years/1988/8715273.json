 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Prof.                    John Burr of the University of Texas at Dallas and Prof. Paolo                  Comoglio of the University of Turin Medical School.  The src                    gene of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) is responsible for the ability                 of this virus to transform cells in culture and to induce tumors                in birds and other animals.  The investigators plan to determine                the mechanism by which the protein encoded by the oncogene (src)                of this virus results in a malignant transformation.  With this                 in mind, they want to identify those cellular proteins that are                 natural substrates for the protein.  They have obtained a                       library of monoclonal antibodies which are reactive against                     phosphotyrosine-containing proteins.  Using these antibodies,                   they have begun to identify and purify individual candidate                     substrate proteins.                                                                                                                                             The U.S. P.I.'s preliminary results on the purification and the                 generation of immunological reagents against the proteins                       discussed above are very encouraging.  The Italian P.I. is one                  of the world leaders in the use of anti-phosphotyrosine                         antibodies and the researchers are experienced collaborators.                   The investigators are addressing an important problem with                      significant implications concerning our knowledge of cell                       transformations and malignancies.",
