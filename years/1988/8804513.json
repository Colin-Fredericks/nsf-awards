 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will establish an REU Site at the University of                      Wisconsin-Madison in the department of Bacteriology.  This                      intensive eight-week summer research program will provide                       meaningful research experiences in microbiology and molecular                   biology to ten undergraduate students.   Women, minorities and                  the disabled, from institutions where research opportunities are                limited or non-existent will be especially recruited.  The long-                term objective of this program is to stimulate promising young                  scientists to pursue careers in research.  The Department of                    Bacteriology has an internationally recognized research faculty                 who are committed to both graduate and undergraduate education.                 Participating students will have the opportunity to work as part                of a dynamic research team at the forefront of basic research.                  They will be exposed to many modern microbiological, biochemical                and molecular techniques and will use state-of-the-art research                 equipment.  The Department's proven record of providing                         laboratory research opportunities for its own undergraduates will               insure success of the REU project.",
