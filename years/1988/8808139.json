 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal theme of this workshop is the molecular and                       developmental biology of Drosophila.  The various advantages of                 the fruit fly as an experimental system have made the analysis of               Drosophila gene function during development one of the fastest                  growing fields in biology.  One reason for this explosion is the                fact that Drosophila offers a singular advantage, namely, the                   opportunity to approach particular questions using a combination                of genetics, embryology, cellular and molecular biology.  If we                 are to gain insight into the rules underlying metazoan                          development, a multidisciplinary experimental approach has                      obvious advantages.  Yet, such an approach also poses the problem               that it is not often the case that a researcher masters                         completely all those disciplines, or is aware of all the latest                 advances.  Considering these facts, therefore, regular meetings                 of a diverse group of leading Drosophila workers are crucial.  It               is the intention of this EMBO workshop, entitled \"The Molecular                 and Developmental Biology of Drosophila\", to provide a forum for                the free exchange of information and for the establishment of                   numerous collaborations between representatives of many of the                  major Drosophila laboratories from around the world.                                                                                                            The modest funds provided will provide partial travel costs for                 approximately ten young American scientists to attend and                       actively participate in this highly regarded EMBO Workshop.  The                workshop itself is well-structured to effectively promote                       interdisciplinary exchange and to foster desirable collaboration.               The participation of young U.S. scientists is highly desirable.",
