Their study is aimed at                          enhancing the interpretation of satellite remote sensing                        data, with applications to geological, environmental, and                       agricultural problems.  The scientific objective is the                         development of image analysis algorithms especially suitable                    to specific applications of geological, environmental and                       resource evaluation problems.  Scientists from the Image                        Processing Center of Drexel University, Philadelphia, and                       from the Middle East Technical University in Ankara, Turkey,                    will also participate in the study.  This project provides                      funding for the travel and per diem costs for two visits                        between the U.S. and Turkish institutions, and for the cost                     of LANDSAT data (Land MSS, Thematic Mapper, SPOT), and for                      computer time.                                                                  Scope: The project is likely to benefit the U.S. scientists                     who are currently conducting research on geological problems                    at MIT Earth Resources Laboratory as well as the Turkish                        scientists working on agricultural and natural resources                        problems in that country.  It is expected that the                              development of algorithms for analyzing remote sensing data                     will greatly enhance the aquisition of information on the                       earth environment, as well as to specific areas by                              determinig food production, surface features related to                         mineral deposits, petroleum, geothermal sources as well as                      helping in land use planning and mapping of geological                          features.",
