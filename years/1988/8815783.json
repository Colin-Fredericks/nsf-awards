The research is to reisolate the                  chemical character of the Turkish Papaver plant species to determine            the alkaloidal fractions that occur in the species.  In addition, the           investigators will analyze the neutral and acidic extracts of these             plants because very little work has been carried out on these                   non-basic components.  All compounds obtained in sufficiently large             amounts will be forwarded to the National Institute of Health for               screening for anti-tumor and anti-HIV activity.  They will also be              tested commericially for agricultural use.                                                                                                                                                                                                      Scope:  This project is planned to have the Turkish P.I. identify and           _____                                                                           gather the natural plants in Turkey.  Plant extraction will be done             at Istanbul University followed by initial separation and                       identification of compounds.  The research data and samples then go             to Penn State University for higher level purification and                      identification of chemical components.  The Turkish P.I. will                   participate in this advanced research and data compilation.  The                advancement of the international exchange of scientific knowledge and           the training and use of developing countries scientists fulfills a              major objective of the Science in Developing Countries Program.",
