 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is for a three year institute to train a cadre of 50               mathematics teachers in grades 7-10 to learn modern mathematics                 concepts, develop programming skills and learn effective leadership and         teaching methods. The cadre, or lead teachers, are to work with other           teachers thereby affecting approximately 240 teachers throughout the            duration of the project. A problem solving approach is to be taken that         emphasizes algebra and geometry integrated with computing. The cadre are        qualified and highly motivated teachers, including  members of minority         and underrepresented groups, who are to serve as mentors for their              peers. The recruitment and selection process is to emphasize selection          of teachers in underrepresented groups. The first summer activities             consist of courses in mathematics, mathematical problem solving, and            discussions on instructional strategies lasting for four weeks. During          the academic year the cadre members attend additional courses and work          in the laboratory of the center. In their teaching they pilot test the          teaching modules that they develop in the workshop under the supervision        of the project staff. Classes and demonstration lessons are to be video         taped during the school year and used by the cadre members with other           teachers. During the second summer the cycle begins anew with an                additional 25 cadre members and the workshop involves members of the            earlier cadre group. The initial cadre also take additional courses             during the second summer and prepare to establish instructional settings        for other teachers. The third year of the project is to involve all             cadre members in working with other teachers, who are in turn observed          and video taped by the project staff.",
