 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous work on this grant has concentrated on the dynamics               of the dayside magnetosphere as determined from plasma                          measurements made on the Dynamics Explorer 1 spacecraft.  The                   area of prime emphasis in this research has been the injection of               solar-wind plasma through the polar cusp and its subsequent                     transport within the magnetosphere.  The new work will continue                 to focus on this area primarily using data from the Dynamics                    Explorer 1 spacecraft, but with correlative data from Isee-1,                   Isee-3, AMPTE, EISCAT, and ground stations in Antarctica, Alaska,               and Scandinavia.  In addition, significant effort will go toward                the study of the mapping of the low-latitude boundary layer to                  midaltitudes and of the dayside parallel and transverse                         acceleration of ions and electrons.  An important new phenomenon,               the flux transfer event (FTE) will be introduced in studying the                interactions of the magnetosheath with the ionosphere.                          Midaltitude signatures of FTE's, called reconnected flux tubes                  (RFT's), will be correlated with magnetopause FTE's and ground                  signatures of FTE effects in the ionosphere.  Confirmation of                   ground signatures of FTE's under the polar cusps will make                      available a vast set of FTE observations that can be used to                    study the behavior of flows in the low-latitude boundary layer.                      The importance of this work resides in the recognition that                FTE's represent a major source of magnetic energy for the                       magnetosphere.  Spacecraft data have been used to identify FTE's                and now this work will use ground based data to investigate                     ionosphere signatures.  This is one of the objectives of Geospace               Environment Modelling (GEM) and, therefore, this work can be                    regarded as a forerunner to GEM.",
