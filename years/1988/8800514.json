The algorithms will be                 aimed at the following types of problems: (1) for the mesh:                     computational geometry, including dynamic as well as static                     problems; (2) for the pyramid: restricted pictures which are                    defined by derived metrics; (3) for the mesh-of-trees and                       hypercube: fundamental data-movement operations, with application               to image analysis, computational geometry, and graph theory;                    also, a mapping will be developed that will allow pyramid                       algorithms to run efficiently on a mesh-of-trees; (4) for the                   mesh with a reconfigurable bus: fundamental data-movement                       operations, image analysis, and graph theory; also, a                           demonstration will be provided that this model combines the                     advantages of a number of other architectures; and (5) for the                  parallel random access machine: dynamic computational geometry.                 Algorithms to solve problems in image analysis and computational                geometry will be implemented on a hypercube multiprocessor, where               we will concentrate on advanced data reduction techniques and                   load-balancing issues that arise when data reduction is                         performed.",
