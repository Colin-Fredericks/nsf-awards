 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cold Spring Harbor Symposia have been held each summer                 since 1933, with the exception of the years of World War II.                    Each year a subject is chosen that seems to be at the stage where               a general scrutiny and review is needed.  The topic for each                    Symposium is arrived at by discussion with a large number of                    people.  The 1988 annual Symposium, entitled \"The Molecular                     Biology of Signal Transduction\", will be held at the Cold Spring                Harbor Laboratory from May 25-June 1, l988.  It is expected that                350-400 scientists will attend.  The meeting will follow the                    traditional Cold Spring Harbor Symposium format and will consist                of 12 formal sessions over seven days.  All of the speakers are                 encouraged to present their latest results.  The proceedings of                 each meeting are published by the Laboratory.                                        Since 1933 the annual Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on                       Quantitative Biology have brought together scientists from all                  over the world to present and discuss both formally and                         informally, exciting areas in the forefront of biology.  This                   year's symposium on \"The Molecular Biology of Signal                            Transduction\" promises to be another excellent contribution to                  the consolidation of new knowledge and dissemination of the                     latest new research results in this fast moving and extremely                   important field.",
