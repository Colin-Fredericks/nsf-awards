The U.S. work will be coordinated by Dr. George                      Krauss of the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) and the Indian                     work will be coordinated by Dr. V. Ramaswamy of the Research                    and Development Center, Steel Authority of India Limited                        (SAIL) in Ranchi, India.  Most of the specimen preparations,                    processing and testing on a bench scale as well as some pilot                   plant processing will be performed in India.  The U.S.                          investigators will concentrate on special analysis and                          interpretation of results.  The projects and the cooperating                    scientists are:                                                                                                                                                 1.

Scope:  The projects to be supported are of great interest to                   U.S. and Indian scientists for understanding the mechanics of                   production of better steel materials for various applications.                  They were developed during and following an Indo-U.S. workshop                  on Steel Research held in India in January 1986.                                                                                                                Funding:  The projects are being funded under two grants.
