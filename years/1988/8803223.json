Its work is also aimed at                   upgrading the quality of statistical information on which                       important basic research and public policy decisions are founded.               The committee, composed of distinguished statisticians and other                scientists of eminence, identifies problem areas in which                       statistical questions are pivotal, and carries out studies which                evaluate these questions comprehensively and seek to provide                    feasible solutions. Broad support for the committee's                           developmental activities and basic operating costs is provided by               a consortium of federal agencies led by the National Science                    Foundation. Each agency contributes an annual sum proportionate                 to its interest in the committee's yearly agenda and the size of                its own research budget. The award recommended at present                       represents the foundation's financial participation in the                      consortium for Fiscal Year 1988. The award also carries                         notification of the foundation's intention to make similar                      contributions to the committee's upkeep in future years,                        contingent upon satisfactory scientific progress and the                        availability of funds.",
