 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although the disciplines of immunobiology and parasitology have            always been closely aligned, only within the last 20 years have                 parasitologists started to address fundamental questions regarding              the mechanisms of immune interaction between parasites and their                hosts.  Mammals, in particular mice, rats, non.human primates and               humans, have predominated as the host systems of choice for                     immunoparasitological studies, and the resulting research has                   produced many basic discoveries new to the immunological world.                 However, the successful integration of these two disciplines has come           only through the recognition ofthe potential for creating new                   information from investigating the immunology of parasite-host                  systems, and a willingness of both immunologists and parasitologists            to collaborate actively in their research efforts.  The purpose of              the symposium, \"Phylogeny of Immune Defense Mechanisms in Parasitic             Infections,\" is to encourage an expansion of this collaborative                 interaction between comparative immunologists working with a                    diversity of animal species, from mammals to invertebrates, and                 immunoparasitologists investigating similar host species. Invited               speakers will review the current knowledge of parasite immunity in              hosts representing a variety of animal phyla, will compare and                  contrast responses of a variety of hosts to different parasites, and            identify areas and questions in need of further study.  Although the            symposium is oriented primarily towards individuals with interests in           immunobiology and/or parasitology, it should have broad appeal to               those interested in invertebrate biology, cell biology, and                     biochemistry since many of the immunoparasitological problems to be             discussed are amenable to interdisciplinary approaches.  Student                interaction will be strongly encouraged through a contributed paper             session following the theme of the symposium.",
