 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to research and build a parallel                    input/output (I/O) system for a shared-memory multiprocessor.  The main         applications intended for this system are parallel database operations          with a target performance of 1000 transactions per second.  This                project is a natural extension of work done at the University of                California, Berkeley in shared-memory multiprocessor architecture (SPUR         project) and database management systems (INGRES and POSTGRES).                                                                                                 While many research results have been obtained in the area of processor         and memory design by a number of research groups, considerable less             effort has been directed towards the issues of I/O design.  As                  processor speeds increase, it becomes more obvious that I/O operations          constitute the bottleneck of parallel systems. Disk technology is now           at the stage where it can provide cost effective high I/O bandwidth.                                                                                            The specific research objectives are:  (1) to investigate new ways to           couple large numbers of I/O devices to multiprocessors without                  affecting the limited memory system bandwidth; (2) to explore                   architectures for I/O processors; and (3) to implement hardware assists         for database applications such as stable memories, string manipulation          co-processors and hardware coherency and logging mechanisms.                    This proposal is strongly recommended for funding because:  (1) the             principal investigators research records are excellent and the research         environment is extremely stimulating--thus there is a high chance of            success; (2) there is a great need for research in the parallel                 processing area covered by this project and it is expected that the             impact of this research will be significant.",
