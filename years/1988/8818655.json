 "awd_abstract_narration": "The New Jersey Marine Sciences Consortium, in conjunction with                  the New York/New Jersey Port Authority, the National Oceanic and                Atmospheric Administration, and the U.S.- Japan Foundation                      proposes to design, coordinate, execute, and control an                         International Symposium on Coastal Ocean Space Utilization.  This               Conference will bring together leading ocean experts from                       science, technology, industry, and government to consider                       questions of how to effectively use ocean space.  The Conference                will be composed of panels to examine the social and technical                  aspects of living and working on and in the ocean.  Speakers will               be recruited from at least eight nations.  It will be a closed                  conference limited to about 200 persons brought together for the                purpose of interacting and developing new ideas.  Experts will be               drawn from science, technology, industry, and government.                       Special emphasis will be on the multi-use aspects of the coastal                oceans, avoidance of user conflicts and future technological                    needs.                                                                                                                                                          This symposium will furnish an International Forum in which                     consideration of major technical issues and problems will                       highlight the most promising research opportunities in the ocean.               Thus, one of the most important products of the Conference will                 be its identification and guidance of the most promising ocean                  engineering research possibilities.",
