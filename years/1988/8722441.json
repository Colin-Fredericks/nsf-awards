A strong presence at this meeting is                          extremely important in view of the ever-increasing strength of                  the Japanese chemical community.  Increased visibility of U.S.                  chemists will be beneficial to fruitful interactions between                    the two scientific communities.  The possibility of travel                      support through this grant will be advertised and the                           applications will be reviewed by a panel of senior scientists.                  Professional, ethnic, and geographic considerations will be                     considered in the final selection of grantees.  This travel                     grant is being funded by the Organic and Macromolecular                         Chemistry Program.",
