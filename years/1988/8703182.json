 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mammalian high molecular weight aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases                 are associated in a multi-enzyme complex in contrast to the                     free soluble enzymes in lowere organisma.  The objectives of                    this award are to elucidate the structure and function of these                 complex entities and to establish the principles which govern                   the protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions.  Three lines                  of inquiry are planned.  The first is analyze the structural                    and functional interactions of the synthetase complex with the                  protein biosythetic machinery.  The second is to determine the                  structures of the individual synthetases and associated                         proteins in the complex through molecular cloning and                           sequencing of the respective cDNAs.  The last is to develop a                   protein foot-printing method to determine the structural                        elements involved in the protein-protein and protein-RNA                        interactions.                                                                        Supramolecular protein-RNA complexes are extremely                         important in the function of living cells.  The results of                      these studies will lead to a better understanding of how such                   complexes in general, and the synthetase complex in particular,                 are assembled and endabled to function in mammalian and other                   living systems.",
