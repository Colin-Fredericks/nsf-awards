McHugh of the Chemical Engineering                   Department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.                   The research is in the area of polymer membrane formation, an                   area in which Dr. McHugh is conducting extensive research under                 an NSF Grant from the CBT Division.  Dr. Yilmaz will be                         primarily involved in a number of mathematical modeling aspects                 of the research, since he is currently one of the best qualified                scientists working on the modeling of membrane formations.  New                 membrane formation processes are relevant to the growth of the                  technological base in Turkey and other developing countries, as                 they are proving to be more energy efficient, cost effective                    alternatives to the traditional unit separation processes.                                                                                                      Scope:  This project allows a bright young scientist from                       Turkey, who recently obtained his doctorate in the U.S. to                      participate effectively in on-going, United States based                        research of significant relevance to his country, to other                      developing countries and to the U.S.  This proposal's objectives                meets the Science in Developing Countries objectives very well.",
