 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most chloroplast proteins are encoded in the nucleus,                           synthesized in the cytoplasm as higher molecular weight                         precursors and imported into chloroplasts posttranslationally.                  Our long term goal is to understand how this import process                     occurs.  Protein import will be studied in an in vitro                          reconstituted assay.  In this assay, radiolabeled precursor                     proteins are first synthesized by in vitro transcription and                    translation of cloned precursor genes and then incubated with                   isolated intact chloroplasts.  The present studies will focus                   on two particular aspects of the import process.  The first                     is the mechanism whereby precursor proteins get translocated                    across the two envelope membranes.  Efforts will be made to                     identify translocation intermediates in order to gain a more                    complete description of the stages in the import process.                       Efforts will also be made to identify proteins of the                           chloroplast envelope membranes that are involved in precursor                   import.  The second aspect of the proposed studies will be to                   investigate the pathway and mechanisms whereby                                  cytoplasmically synthesized proteins are transported to the                     thylakoid lumen.  This process is particularly interesting                      because these proteins cross three membranes between their                      site of synthesis and their final location.%%%                                                                                                                  The insights gained from this work will be important in two                     respects.  First, they will add to basic knowledge regarding                    the targeting of cytoplasmically synthesized proteins to                        their proper locations in eukaryotic cells.  Second, these                      results will have practical application during efforts to                       alter the metabolism of chloroplasts by genetic                                 engineering.***//",
