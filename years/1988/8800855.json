 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting Facility at the Bigelow                     Laboratory of Ocean Sciences will further develop the                           operation and methodology of flow cytometric applications to                    marine biology/oceanography.  This multi-user facility has                      been instrumental in adapting flow cytometry, a technology                      developed for use in the biomedical research community, for                     ocean science research.  With this technique, a stream of                       phytoplankton cells or other microscopic particles is passed                    through a laser light beam.  Different cells and particles                      can be enumerated and classified according to how they                          fluoresce or react in response to the laser light.  Analysis                    of the fluoresced signal can yield important information on                     cell size, cellular constituents, and metabolic condition.                                                                                                      Work will continue to develop appropriate flow cytometry                        standards and items useful for intercalibration of phyto-                       plankton data.  The Facility will be available for use by                       guest investigators.  Coordination with industry will promote                   further development and modifications to basic flow cytometry                   instrumentation for oceanographic research.  Improvements and                   modifications will be directed towards towards a) expanding                     dynamic range of the instruments (4-decade log representa-                      tion), b) increasing the specific volume analyzed, c)                           incorporating volume sensing as well as light scatter,  d)                      automating an on-line sampler for a pump profiling system,                      and e) making the system more rugged for shipboard use.",
