 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support U.S. participation in a seminar on the                  \"Developmental Biology of the Ascidian\" organized jointly by                    Professor Charles Lambert of California State University,                       Fullerton and Dr. Takaharu Numakunai of Tohoku University, Japan.               Six U.S. researchers will meet with Japanese scientists in August               1988 at the Asamushi Marine Biological Station of the Tohoku                    University.  Topics of ascidian biology to be discussed include:                the molecular basis of fertilization and cell differentiation                   during cleavage, control of the reproductive cycle, controls of                 colony formation and recognition, the accumulation and function of              metal ions during development, the mechanism of metamorphosis, the              formation of complex extracellular structures, and the nature of                substances made by ascidians which are toxic to viruses, bacteria               and tumor cells.                                                                                                                                                Ascidians, as the most primitive of the living chordates, are                   ideal organisms for studying basic questions in developmental                   biology and may teach us much about the development and evolution               of vertebrates.  Remarkable strides have been made over the last                five years in our understanding of many aspects of ascidian                     development.  This joint U.S.-Japan seminar will provide a                      much-needed forum for the exchange of research results and ideas                between ascidian biologists in our two countries.",
