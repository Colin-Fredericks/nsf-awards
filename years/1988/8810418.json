 "awd_abstract_narration": "Protein kinases are an important class of regulatory enzymes in                 all cells but are particularly important in the nervous system.                 When these enzymes are activated within cells in response to                    extracellular signals, they transfer phosphate to serine,                       threonine, or tyrosine residues on other proteins.  This transfer               may alter protein folding and function.  In this way, protein                   kinases regulate cellular function.  In the studies proposed                    here, a brain protein kinase that is activated by transient high                calcium concentrations will be studied in the genetic organism,                 Drosophila melanogaster (the fruit fly).  Mammalian genes for                   this enzyme have been sequenced.  The genes encoding this                       important brain enzyme in the fly will be sequenced and mapped                  within the Drosophila genome.  This approach will facilitate the                generation of mutants in the kinase and will allow studies of the               behavior of flies with mutant kinase genes.                                                                                                                     These studies will significantly advance our understanding of the               basic molecular mechanisms that underlie information processing                 and storage in nervous systems.",
