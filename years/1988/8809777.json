 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are encouraging the spread of VLSI design education to a wider range         of institutions.  The increased availability of VLSI design courses and         fabrication through MOSIS is important not only because of educational          relevance, but also because of the industrial need for designers with           VLSI skills.  We plan to help with the entry of VLSI design into                curricula at institutions that are otherwise not able to cope with the          relatively costly initial steps, which are teacher preparation and              installation of computer hardware and software appropriate for                  computer-aided design.                                                          The proposed educators conference and exposition are efficient means            for spreading know-how needed for informed entry into VLSI education.           The technical leadership for this event will come from Mr. Paul                 Losleben.  He is one of the pioneers in VLSI fabrication service and            particularly well qualified to lead the proposed effort.  He has                delineated a sound plan.  The requested funds, which are modest, are            adroitly leveraged.  The proposed conference and exposition are                 promising, practical and cost-effective steps for helping the expansion         of VLSI design education in U.S. institutions.",
