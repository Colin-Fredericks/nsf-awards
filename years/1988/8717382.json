 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Manufacturing Studies Board will establish a series of                  committees to analyze research directions and to develop a                      strategic research framework for technologies specifically                      related to manufacturing.  To accomplish this, the committee                    will:  (1) identify and prioritize manufacturing-related                        technologies and disciplines to produce a comprehensive                         manufacturing research agenda for the National Science Foundation               (NSF) and the U.S. research community, and (2) conduct a series                 of analyses of the technologies and disciplines in the research                 agenda to determine the current state of the art, research                      activities, and needed future research initiatives.  The                        resulting reports are expected to provide the NSF, as well as                   academic and industrial researchers, with an authoritative basis                for focusing their research and funding activities.  The                        activities of the committees are intended to be steps in a                      dynamic process that will adapt as technologies and the                         competitive environment change.",
