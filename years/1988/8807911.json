 "awd_abstract_narration": "Naturally emitted nitrogen oxides are of biogeochemical                    significance in terms of local nitrogen budgets and influences on               atmospheric chemistry.  Two of the most important nitrogen oxides               in the context are nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO).                   Present evidence suggests that tropical soils may be primary                    source of N2O on a global basis and that pastures converted from                tropical forests may be especially active sources of N2O.                       Because neotropical forests are being converted to pastures on                  such a large scale, it is evident that the neotropical forest-                  to-pasture transition is the most important kind of ecosystem in                which N2O flux measurements should be made.                                          Much less is known about NO flux than about N2O, but                       available data suggest that NO may be more important as a                       naturally emitted nitrogen oxide from tropical soils than is N2O.               Data strongly indicate that NO fluxes should be measured along                  with N2O fluxes if tropical soils are to be evaluated as an NOx                 source to the atmosphere.                                                            This research entails field measurements of N2O and NO flux                from replicated plots representing primary forest, secondary                    forest, and pastures on relatively fertile alluvial soils and                   relatively infertile residual soils in the Caribbean Lowlands of                Costa Rica.  These measurements together with concurrent                        measurements of soil properties such as H2O content and NH4+                    concentration will not only provide an estimate of annual fluxes                from soils to the atmosphere, but will provide a statistical                    means to screen for potential causal relations.  Such                           multivariate analyses will be related to field and laboratory                   experiments to define causal factors driving these fluxes.                            The overall importance of this research derives from two                  primary sources.  First, the oxides of nitrogen under study are                 felt to the major components of the array of atmospheric                        \"greenhouse\" gases that contribute to global climate changes.  As               well, the study will yield important fundamental information                    regarding the system effects of land use changes in tropical                    environments.  In this context it should produce significant                    results of wide utility.",
