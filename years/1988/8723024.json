 "awd_abstract_narration": "Varved sediment in the Santa Barbara Basin is a unique recorder                 of temperate-subarctic and subtropical flora and fauna which                    preserves an annual signal through anaerobic deposition.  Effects               of climatic change are greatly magnified by fluctuations in the                 productivity of surface waters and of preservation at the                       seafloor.  For example, the introduction of subtropic biota                     during strong El Nino events coincides with decreased                           bioproductivity in the photic zone and with increases                           oxygenation of the otherwise anoxic bottom waters.  In this                     interdisciplinary research project sediment cores from Santa                    Barbara Basin off California will first be studied by physical                  and chemical means to identify periods, within the last 600                     years, when climate changed rapidly of fluctuated strongly.                     These abrupt changes will then be scrutinized in detail, for                    changes in diatom flora and foraminiferal fauna, both planktonic                and benthic, and for shifts in geochemical and isotopic                         parameters.  The resulting multidisciplinary time series are to                 be interpreted in terms of changes in the oceanographic                         conditions of the California Current, using calibrations worked                 out previously.  The results are to be compared with information                from tree rings and ice records from North America and other                    regions of the Northern hemisphere.  The aim is to assess the                   frequency of unusual events in the past, their expression in the                California Current as far as it can be read from its varved                     record, and the teleconnections, if any, with climatic changes                  elsewhere.",
