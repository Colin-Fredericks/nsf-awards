 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Devonian Period was a time of diversification among                    early land plants, and the Gaspe Penninsula of Canada and Maine                 hold a rich fossil record of these primitive groups.  Dr.                       Patricia Gensel has requested continued support for her efforts                 to collect, prepare, and describe representatives of several of                 the early lineages of land plants found there.  Electron                        microscoy and computer-aided 3-dimensional synthesis of thin                    sections will be used to study and reconstruct tissue structures.               Variability will be studied in order to better delimit the                      species and genera present.                                                          The proposed work has important implications beyond the                    samples to be described.  Her descriptive work will add                         significantly to our understanding of the anatomy and growth of                 these plants, and of their ecological circumstances and                         evolutionary relationships.  These observations will lead to more               sophisticated analyses of ancestor-descendant relationships, and                they have potential to reshape the current classification of                    early land plants.",
