 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in coral reef communities has been directed towards learning           why single-celled algae, the zoothanthellae, live in animal cells such          as those of corals and anenomes.  A popular assumption has been that            the host cell provides a high nutrient environment in otherwise                 nutrient poor waters.  Drs. Cook and Muller-Parker have shown that              zooxanthellae, the algal symbionts of corals and other reef                     invertebrates, can be limited by inorganic nutrients.  This research            project addresses the question of nutrient limitation with an emphasis          on the effect of nutrient status on productivity of the zoothanthellae          and on the relative contribution of dissolved versus host-derived               sources to the nutrient budgets of these algae.  Biochemical and                physiological techniques will be applied to both laboratory cultures            and in situ coral reef populations.  Results will help answer                   questions relating to the regulation and control of symbiotic systems,          mechanisms of nutrient transport and the roles of zooxanthellae in              coral reef carbon and nutrient recycling processes.",
