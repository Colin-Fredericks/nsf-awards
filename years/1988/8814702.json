 "awd_abstract_narration": "The presence of a nontrivial symmetry group can profoundly                 affect the dynamics of a physical system.  In particular, it has                been recently appreciated that the instabilities or bifurcations                observed in such systems typically exhibit highly nongeneric                    features when symmetry breaking occurs.  This project is to study               the nonlinear mathematical models with detailed investigation of                specific physical systems.  Particular emphasis is placed on the                symmetry groups 0(2) and S0(2) because of their relevance to                    applications, and on the dynamics arising from multiple                         instabilities of mode interactions.  The technique to be applied                are those of equivariant bifurcation theory, center manifold                    reduction, and normal form analysis.   The goal is to obtain an                 understanding of symmetry breaking transitions between pre-                     chaotic states as well as the impact of symmetry on the                         transition to chaos.  For specific fluid systems with circular                  symmetry one expects to obtain results which may be tested in                   numerical and laboratory experiments.",
