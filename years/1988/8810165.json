 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this research are the characterization of pollen                   specific genes and genes expressed in both pollen and in                        sporophytic tissues and an identification of cis-acting                         regulatory sequence elements and trans-acting regulatory                        factors and their genes.  The immediate objectives of the                       proposed research are:  (i) to completely sequence the coding                   and 5' and 3' flanking regions of two pollen specific genes                     and two genes that are expressed both in pollen and in                          vegetative tissue; (ii) to identify cis-acting regulatory                       elements required for pollen expression by the use of cloned                    genes and DNA footprinting following binding with nuclear                       proteins; (iii) to determine the developmental time course of                   activation of trans-acting nuclear factors; (iv) to determine                   the organization in the chromosome, of pollen and sporophyte                    expressed genes, and (v) to determine by in situ                                hybridization the sites of localization of specific mRNAs in                    the male gametophyte.%%%                                                                                                                                        The male gametophyte (pollen grain-pollen tube) plays a very                    important part in the life cycle of flowering plants.  It                       produces two sperm cells and transports them through the                        tissues of the style and into the embryo sac in the ovule in                    the immediate vicinity of the egg and central cell.  In the                     double fertilization that follows, fusion of the sperm cells                    with the egg and central cell gives rise to the zygote and                      primary endosperm cell respectively.  The embryo and                            endosperm of crop plants are of vital importance to the                         nutrition of humans and domesticated animals.  The results of                   these studies could help us to better utilize pollen                            selection as a tool in plant breeding.  The isolation and                       characterization of pollen specific promoters will be of                        value in plant biotechnology in the engineering of male                         sterile lines for the production of hybrid seed.***",
