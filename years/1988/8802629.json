 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Hill and his collaborators will continue their research in                  the Tugen Hills region of Kenya and conduct an additional three                 seasons of fieldwork.  Within this area fossiliferous sediments,                in five major formations, range from older than 14 million years                to less than 2.4 million years ago.  In addition to a wide range                of mammalian species, these sediments have yielded two important                primate remains:  a Proconsul (early ape) specimen dated to                     approximately 12 million years ago and a hominid (human) with an                age of ca. 5 million years.  This is the oldest known hominid                   specimen.                                                                                                                                                       The group will continue their systematic examination of the Tugen               Hills and in particular focus on sediments which have the                       potential to yield significant primate fossils.  The                            stratigraphic sequence will be refined and absolute ages                        determined by K/Ar and paleomagnetic dating techniques.  This                   region is particularly important because it fills an important                  gap in the human paleontological record.  From areas in both                    Africa and other parts of the world, good samples of higher                     primates and associated fauna are available for the period from                 32 to 14 million years ago and also for a subsequent period from                3.6 million years to the present.  However, information                         concerning the intervening time, from 14 to 4 million years is                  lacking.  The best available relevant section in Africa is                      provided by the Tugen Hills, and thus, research there is                        important.                                                                                                                                                      In a broader perspective this project is significant because it                 helps to trace the development of the human species.  To                        understand ourselves as we are today, it is necessary to trace                  our long-term history and to elucidate the processes which are                  reflected therein.",
