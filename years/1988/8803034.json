 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Federal Construction Council (FCC), established in 1953, is a               continuing activity of the Building Research Board (BRB) of the                 National Academy of Sciences.  Its fundamental purpose is to provide            a common base for technical studies by those federal agencies that              are responsible for the design, construction, and operation of                  federal government facilities or for construction-related research.             Because the FCC is the only organization in the United States in                which the various autonomous federal construction agencies meet                 regularly to identify and resolve common problems, it fulfills a                unique and vital function.  This grant provides partial support of              the Council.                                                                    During 1988, work will continue on the development of a conceptual              framework for an integrated computer data base encompassing the                 entire construction process.  The program titles of five advisory               studies included in the 1988 program include:  Integrated Data Base             Development (Phase VI); Assessing the Impact on Federal Agencies of             the Use of Building Codes as Design Criteria; Improving the                     Operation, Maintenance, and Repair of Federal Facilities; Criteria              for Selecting and Evaluating Heating, Ventilating, and Air-                     conditioning (HVAC) Systems for Buildings; and the Use of Risk                  Appraisal in the Development of Design Criteria for Facilities.                 NSF involvement in the FCC provides an important link for input to              the development of activities in the area of structures,                        construction, and building research, particularly as it relates                 to the NSF Structures and Building Systems Program.  Reports                    resulting from FCC activities will be prepared in sufficient                    quantity to ensure distribution to the sponsors, committee                      members, and to other interested parties.  In accordance with the               NAS policy, such reports also may be made available to the public               without restrictions.",
