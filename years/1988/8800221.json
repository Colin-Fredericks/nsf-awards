 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to evaluate the energetics of                 an inducible chemical defense in an insect.  The species that                   will be used, Diploptera punctata (a Pacific Island cockroach),                 is known to synthesize and store a mixture of quinones which it                 sprays at predators.  It has recently been shown that this                      chemical defense is under endogenous control.  Therefore, it is                 possible to obtain individuals with and without defensive                       quinones.                                                                                                                                                       How the total energy budget of a polymorphic organism is affected               under different expressions of the trait will be determined.  Of                particular interest is a test of energetic compromise:  the idea                that because organisms operate under limited energy budgets, an                 elaboration or hypertrophy in one part must be accompanied by a                 reduction elsewhere.  The total energy budgets for defended and                 undefended cockroaches in two different feeding regimes will be                 estimated by oxygen consumption measurements.  Size and fecundity               will be measured to assess a possible reallocation of energy                    between growth or reproduction and chemical defense.  The results               will show whether reallocation of energy occurs within a fixed                  energy budget or whether the total energy budget is increased to                accommodate the costs of an induced chemical defense.                                                                                                           The project will be supported by funds provided for a one-year                  postdoctoral research fellowship to Dr. Catherine Loudon, who                   will conduct the studies at Cornell University.",
