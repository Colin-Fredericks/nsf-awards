 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hazardous waste management is a world wide concern.  The                   French Ministry of Environment is initiating an                                 Industry/University Cooperative Research Center with a consortium               of French universities to address this area.  If this Center is                 successfully initiated, it represents an opportunity of                         complementary research with which the New Jersey Institute of                   Technology's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for                Hazardous Waste Management might interact.  Such a collaboration                could occur as part of a new experimental program, International                Industry-University-Government Cooperative Research Initiative.                      This award funds a case study of the French efforts to                     establish an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for                Hazardous Waste Management.  Upon the completion of French                      activities initiating the Center, the New Jersey Institute of                   Technology is to publish a report detailing the case history and                its success.  If the Center is successfully formed with a                       significant number of companies providing support, a second phase               of the award funds a study to design an international cooperative               research program.  The study will address potential research areas              and organizational ties that need to be developed to have an                    International Industry-University-Government Cooperative Research               Initiative.                                                                          The Principal Investigator and colleague are internationally               recognized experts and have both the industrial and international               contacts necessary to perform the studies.                                           The Program Manager recommends the New Jersey Institute of                 Technology be awarded $45,000 for a two (2) year continuing grant.              The first phase is recommended for $25,000 for one (1) year.  The               second phase of $20,000 for one (1) year from the Directorate for               Science, Technological and International Affairs will be                        contingent upon NSF evaluation of the phase one report indicating               the success of the French Center.",
