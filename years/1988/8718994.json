 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project provides support for travel and field                research for Dr. Trevor Price and a graduate student to study tghe              development and evolution of plumage patterns and their possible role           in speciation, in a continental genus of birds, the Old World Leaf              Warblers.  The fieldwork will be in the Kashmir area of India.                  Laboratory work, for measurement to quantify morphological variation            will follow.  Recently developed quantitative genetic methods and               theories of pattern formation will be applied to reconstruct                    selection pressures which occurred during evolution of the plumage              patterns.  The results are to contribute to the understanding of the            development of evolution in bird populations.                                                                                                                   Scope:  The P.I. has established formal contacts with India's                   Department of Forest and Wildlife and has received permission to                conduct the proposed work.  He will be collaborating with scientists            from that Department and from Bombay Natural History Society.  The              research is likely to contribute to the body of knowledge on the                ecology and natural evoluation of birds, and is also likely to                  enhance U.S.-Indian collaboration in this field.",
