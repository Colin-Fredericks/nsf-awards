 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Gurr wants to determine, in molecular terms, how the biosynthesis of        the alpha and beta subunits of thyrotropin (TSH) is regulated by thyroid        hormone (T3).  He previously demonstrated that T3 inhibits the                  transcription of alpha and beta TSH genes, and the inhibition of TSH            beta gene transcription was more marked than that of alpha.  He now             wants to identify cis-acting DNA sequence elements and trans-acting             factors which modulate the response of alpha and beta TSH to T3 and             which determine tissue-specific TSH alpha and beta gene activity.  The          binding sites for the T3 receptor on the alpha and beta genes will be           delineated by DNAase footprinting and methylation protection, using T3          receptor protein which has been synthesized in vitro from T3 receptor           cDNA.  Other specific trans-acting factors interacting with these genes         will be identified in nuclear extracts from thyrotropic tumors.  Genomic        footprinting will be used to assess the relevance of the in vitro               binding data to the situation in intact chromatin.  Cis-acting sequence         elements and trans-acting factors which are involved in determining             tissue specific alpha and beta TSH gene expression will be identified           using in vitro transcription, with nuclear extracts from thyrotropic            tumors and tissues in which the alpha and beta TSH genes are not                expressed, e.g., liver and kidney.                                                                                                                              These experiments are important since they will demonstrate the                 mechanism by which hormones are able to regulate gene expression within         specific tissues.  While many investigators are working on this general         problem, Dr. Gurr is studying the negative regulation of a hormone which        is composed of 2 subunits, one common to other pituitary hormones and           one that is unique, and is an example of feedback inhibition of a               substance which regulates its production.",
