Twelve students who have completed          their junior year will be selected from the high schools of Ohio,               Indiana, and Kentucky.  Young Scholars will spend 6 weeks during the            summer of 1987-88 and 1988-89 in residence at Miami University.                 Students will attend formal lecture presentations and research seminars         in the morning, Monday through Friday, and perform research experiments         in molecular biology research projects in the laboratories of selected          faculty research mentors from the Botany, Microbiology, and Zoology             Departments in the afternoons.  Additionally, Young Scholars will               attend informal seminars on career opportunities in molecular biology,          on the college admission process, and the scientific ethics, risk, and          social responsibilities of recombinant DNA researchers.  Miami's                residence hall staff will arrange different social, cultural, and               sports activities for the Young Scholars.",
