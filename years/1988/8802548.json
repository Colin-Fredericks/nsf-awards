The committee, in its        fourth year, successfully completed the following                               projects:  (1) Recommendations for the Strong-motion Program in                 the United States and (2) Review of Phase I of the National                     Earthquake Engineering Experimental Facility (NEEEF) Study.                     In its fifth year of operation, the committee will continue to                  oversee the completion of the following three projects:  (1)                    Earthquake Engineering for Concrete Dams, (2) Seismic Policy                    Adoption and Implementation, and (3) Seismic Effects on Large                   Underground Structures.  The committee also proposes to begin the               following two new programs:  (1) U.S.- PRC Earthquake                           Engineering Program, and (2) Conference on Strategic Planning to  Reduce        the Potential Economic Impact of Earthquake Hazard                              Worldwide.",
