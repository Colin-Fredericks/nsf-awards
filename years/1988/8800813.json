 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program provides renewed support for a project                        concerned with the organometallic chemistry of the actinide and                 lanthanide elements. The actinide elements include the very                     heavy metals, such as uranium, whereas the lanthanide elements,                 also known as the \"rare earths,\" include the less familiar                      metals, such as neodynium and yttrium which find practical uses                 in lasers. These elements are of substantial current interest                   to organometallic chemists because they have been found to                      react in unusual and synthetically useful ways with organic                     compounds.                                                                                                                                                      The project is a broad exploration of the chemical properties                   and mechanisms of reactions of organometallic compounds of the                  f-group elements. The goal is to develop and understand new                     chemistry based on the unusual structural and thermodynamic                     properties and reactivity of these metal ions. Chemical                         transformations (both stoichiometric and catalytic) to be                       studied include metal-centered H-H, C-H and C-C activation                      processes, as well as olefin insertion, modification and                        oligomerization processes. Emphasis will be placed also on the                  synthesis and properties of complexes having new types of                       ligands and new formal oxidation states. The long range goal is                 to understand those structural and electronic factors which                     control chemical reactivity of these elements, and to                           capitalize on features which stimulate new or enhanced modes of                 reactivity.",
