 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a three-year cooperative research project in            physics between Professor Pierre Meystre, Optical Sciences Center, The          University of Arizona, and Professor Herbert Walther, Director, Max             Planck Institute for Quantum Optics, Garching, Federal Republic of              Germany.  The scientists will study selected aspects of the dynamics of         one or a few atoms located in optical cavities with dimensions                  approximating the wavelength of light radiated by that atom.  Because           of quantum effects, the radiative properties of atoms in such systems           differ significantly from those of the same atoms in free space.  A             major effort will be directed toward the study of the microscopic               maser.  An important feature of this device is that its operating               regime can be varied from truly classical to truly quantum mechanical,          thus allowing one to monitor, for example, how classical instabilities          and chaos are modified as the system approaches the quantum regime.  In         another important aspect of this work, the collaborating scientists             will study the conditions under which radiation with intensity                  fluctuations below those of conventional lasers (subpoissonian light)           can be produced.                                                                                                                                                This cooperative study in cavity quantum electrodynamics is aimed at            understanding, at a fundamental level, what causes the radiation of             coherent light (laser light).  Professor Meystre and his research group         are theoretically oriented in this area, and Professor Walther and his          colleagues in Garching have the only existing experimental facilities           capable of testing the theoretical predictions of the Meystre group.            The German laboratory also has a Cray-XMP supercomputer which will be           available to Professor Meystre for these studies.  The work is expected         to present new clues toward the understanding of the correspondence             between quantum and classical phenomena in so-called dissipative                systems, that is, systems in which energy is not conserved.",
