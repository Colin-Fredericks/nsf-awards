 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will continue his work on two                  topics.  The first one called multistage testing can be seen as                 the practical compromise between the standard fixed sample size                 methods and the optimal sequential methods.  Sequential one-at-a-               time testing procedures have significant practical problems.                    Previous work of the investigator has shown that asymptotic                     optimality can be achieved by a three stage procedure where the                 size of the sample may depend on the previous stage.  Multistage                procedures change the error probabilities of the problem in                     complex ways.  Dr. Lorden will study the error probabilities and                the choice of successive sample sizes.                                               The second problem is detecting the change in the underlying               distribution as soon after it occurs, as possible.  The new                     method will employ Bayes procedures to utilize the prior                        information on the location of the change point.                                     In sequential tests, both the standard Neyman-type approach                and the Bayesian approach have proved to be valuable.  Dr. Lorden               investigates a partial-Bayes method in which a weighted average                 of the expected sample size is minimized subjected to the                       required error probabilities.",
