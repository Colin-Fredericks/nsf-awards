 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program in organoboron chemistry is being supported by the                 Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program.  The vast                         majority of molecules in natural systems exist in only a right-                 or left-handed form.  This phenomenon was discovered by                         Pasteur.  This work will develop new routes to these right- or                  left-handed forms using organoboron compounds as reagents.                      These organoboron compounds are being developed as synthetic                    tools to facilitate new and economic pathways to the complex                    molecules that occur in nature.                                                                                                                                 The hydroboration reaction makes organoboranes readily                          available.  Research in this area has extended the                              applicability to the synthesis of cyclic, polycyclic and                        various partially alkylated organoboranes.  A recently                          developed method of enhancing the optical purity of mono- and                   diisopinocompheylalkylboranes to essentially 100%                               enantiomerically pure boronic esters opens possibilities for                    preparing a variety of chiral boranes in essentially 100%                       enantiomeric purity.  The reactions of organoboranes commonly                   proceed with complete retention.  For the first time, it is                     possible to develop a procedure for the synthesis of optically                  pure enantiomers.  To explore this possibility, it is planned                   to search for new reactions leading to valuable compounds not                   now available, such as terminal acetylenes, mercaptans,                         nitriles, etc.  A systematic study will be made to modify                       certain existing reactions to accommodate relatively hindered                   optically active groups.  The utility of various homologating                   agents will be explored for the homologation of boracyclanes                    and vinylborane derivatives.  The homologation of                               B-alkyl-9-borabicyclo\u01313.3.1!nonane derivatives to alpha-amino                   acid derivatives will be examined.  The synthesis of various                    stereodefined vinylorganoboranes will be made and studied for                   their utility in the synthesis of a wide variety of unsaturated                 organic compounds.",
