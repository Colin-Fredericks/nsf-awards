 "awd_abstract_narration": "The group singing of the African pygmies is a highly                       intricate form of social interaction.  The Biaka pygmies of                     Central African Republic, Cameroon and the Congo have developed                 this form of expression into a mode that reflects the egalitarian               structure of the society.  The goals of this project are to                     determine what an individual must know in order to participate in               Biaka social interaction as expressed in music and to describe                  the processes of musical creation within a closed, egalitarian                  community.  The student will attempt to convey Biaka                            understandings of their musical performance and of their culture.                    Anthropological analyses are increasingly concerned with                   performance as the structuring of experience, but rarely do they                describe the details of the structures as they emerge within                    actual performances as this study will do.  Specifically,                       essemble music as performance concentrates cultural knowledge in                patterns of interaction, cueing, and non-verbal communicative                   modes.  This study in ethnomosicology will provide creative input               into traditional questions of social structure, gender roles,                   social process, symbolism, and culture change.",
