 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jean Taylor will continue her work on surfaces of minimum                  energy. She will focus her attention on minimizing energy                       functionals which do not possess directional uniformity, this is                known as anisotropism. The techniques to be used come from a                    branch of the calculus of variations, geometric measure theory,                 which is having an ever increasing impact on many areas of                      geometric analysis. This work has applications in materials                     research and some joint projects with John Cahn, a metallurgist,                will be continued. One of her main objectives will be to                        understand the geometric consequences of minimization of crystal-               type anisotropic surface energies. In a slightly different                      direction she will try to develop and employ combinatorial                      techniques of area minimization. These latter techniques become                 appropriate in the polyhedral situations which frequently arise.                     The energy functionals have an integral representation                     inwhich the integrand, known as the free energy, is defined on                  the unit sphere. The free energy in turn gives rise to the Wulff                shape, which is the obect of most of Taylor's studies. She will                 study several new types of singularities in these surfaces and                  some new rules for orientations in heterogeneous nucleation,                    which have been predicted in some of her earlier work with Cahn.                Some of this will involve allowing edge energies in the integral                being minimized. Other investigations will study the evolution of               the minimizing surfaces as the energy function is allowed to                    vary.",
