 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this investigation is to determine the presence               of short-period variability in the flow of Ice Stream B, West                   Antarctica and to measure the propagation of any observable                     motion events along the ice stream.                                                                                                                             The results of this study, when combined with the borehole                      measurements (basal water pressure, motion at and within the                    bed), will lead to a more complete understanding of the                         mechanisms which govern ice stream flow and fast glacier motion                 in general.                                                                                                                                                     A linear array of high-resolution vertical wire strain meters and               geophones will continuously monitor temporal changes in the                     strain field and seismic activity over a one to two-year period.                The array will be centered at the Upstream B drill site and will                overlap with a strain grid.  Flow velocity at the drill site will               be measured daily during the field season.  Taken together, these               measurements will delineate any flow variations which arise from                changing conditions at the basal interface.  As such, the                       proposed research will form an important and integral part of the               borehole drilling program on Ice Stream B.",
