 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to investigate the molecular             mechanisms underlying the determination of cell fate in embryonic               development.  In this study the engrailed gene of Drosophila, a gene            that is essential for the determination of the anterior and posterior           cell lineages of body segments, will be analyzed.  Dr. O'Farrell has            proposed to develop a new assay which will enable him to follow and             analyze the fate of individual cells in early development.  The second          major specific aim is to investigate regulatory elements of the                 engrailed gene as defined by other genes that interact with engrailed.          By applying both approaches this study will define when and where               determination of patterns of engrailed expression occurs and will define        events controlling pattern regulation.                                               Identification of the developmental fate of the descendants of the         cells that express the engrailed gene at the blastoderm stage of the            Drosophila embryo is important for an understanding of the genetic              regulation of segmentation.  The method of marking cells will be a              useful technique which will benefit all developmental biologists                studying Drosophila.",
