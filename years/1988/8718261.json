 "awd_abstract_narration": "Measurements will be made of the rheological properties of suspensions          of fibers in Newtonian fluids.  Two techniques, falling ball rheometry          and rotational viscometry, will be used and the results compared.The            influence of fiber volume fraction, fiber aspect ratio, and fiber               orientation will be studied.  Complimentary studies for suspensions of          spheres are being carried out by the principal investigator with                industrial and national laboratory collaboration.  If time permits,             joint work with a theoretician will model the falling ball                      experiments.                                                                                                                                                    The research should assist in understanding the flow of fluids with             complex microstructure such as are used in preparing fiber reinforced           structures and possibly in influencing the structure of the final               product.  There is a possibility that the experimental results would            stimulate theoreticians to develop very different approaches to the             modelling of suspension rheology.",
