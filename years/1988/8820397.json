 "awd_abstract_narration": "The symposium will be a five-hour nationwide video telecast with active         audience participation.  The emphasis will be on multidisciplinary              aspects of computing technology and applications covering the following         areas:                                                                                                                                                          VLSI, design automation, software engineering, personal computing,              office automation,  machine intelligence, robotics, and test technology.                                                                                        The goal of the interdisciplinary satellite symposium is to:                         a.  Present the state-of-the-art and future trends in rapidly                       evolving computer-based technologies;                                       b.  Suggest directions for fruitful interactions between computing                  technologies and resulting innovative applications;                         c.  Provide a forum for dialogue and interaction                                    between individuals (professionals, faculty, and students) in                   different segments of computer science, computer technology,                    and user communities.                                                                                                                                  The National Science Foundation will sponsor the participation of               approximately 10 minority colleges so that they may benefit from this           highly leveraged technical initiative.  As a companion submission to            the IEEE request the Black College Satellite Network will evaluate the          IEEE-sponsored satellite teleconference.  In addition to providing              downlink services to viewers, BCNS will develop and coordinate the              implementation of a uniform evaluation instrument at the minority               university receive sites.  Evaluation coordinators will be identified           by the deans or department chairs at each participating institution.            Variables to be considered are teleconference logistics, format,                thematic content and effectiveness in providing orientational                   information, outreach and enhanced curriculum offerings.  Results will          address the issues of faculty and student enrichment, student pipeline          quality and quantity and institutional infrastructure impact.",
