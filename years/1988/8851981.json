 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project improves the cell and molecular biology curriculum by         providing equipment to (1) develop a hands-on, instrument-based course          in Microscopy; (2) improve the quality and effectiveness of                     laboratories in existing courses in Cell Biology, Developmental                 Biology, Immunology, and Biological Methods and Instrumentation; and            (3) add current technology in microscopy to the available options in            the department's undergraduate research program.                                                                                                                     The equipment includes three high quality light microscopes                equipped with optics and accessories designed for multiple                      applications of brightfield, phase, polarizing and epi-fluorescence,            and a state-or-the-art image processing and analysis system.  These new         microscopes (along with two existing transmission and x-ray analytical          scanning electron microscopes) will be interfaced by film and video             with the image processor.  The integrated imaging system will be                applied in \"bench-type\" laboratory courses to real experimental                 situations.  This instrument-intensive approach allows students to gain         the experience required to operate modern equipment and the critical            thinking and appreciation required to design modern experiments.  It is         expected to produce graduates who are better equipped for and more              likely to undertake post-graduate studies.                                                                                                                           The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
