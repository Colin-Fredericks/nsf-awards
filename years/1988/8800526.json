 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sheldon Chang will continue his work on minimal surfaces.                  The origins of this subject lie in the study of soap films.                     Because of the surface tension in these films they naturally form               minimal surfaces. That is, for a given boundary they have minimum               area of all surfaces with this boundary. In the mathematical                    theory this property translates into a curvature property of the                surface. Nowadays surfaces with zero mean curvature are referred                to as minimal surfaces. Chang's research is concerned with the                  existence of minimal surfaces within a given surface. This is a                 very natural and important extension since such minimal surfaces                provide a natural extension of the notion of geodesic, that is,                 minimum length path, in the surface.                                                 Chang has developed remarkable expertise in the rather                     inaccessible topic of geometric measure theory. Many of the most                exciting developments in minimal surface theory have made use of                this theory. He will build on recent work of others concerning                  integral currents and varifolds to attack these problems. The                   major focus of the work will be to study the topological type of                these minimal surfaces and the size of their set of                             singularities. Probably the most difficult hurdle to overcome                   will be to find techniques which apply to the high codimensional                situation.",
