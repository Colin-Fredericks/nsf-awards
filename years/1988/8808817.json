 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to determine whether combining                 mathematical models of flow and small scale mixing with kinetic                 models for the neutralization-precipitation of aluminum in water                treatment processes could predict the nature of the speciation of               aluminum that occurs during fast-base neutralization in small,                  batch turbine reactors.  While equilibrium chemical models have                 advanced the understanding of the chemistry of the aluminum system              and its efficacy as a chemical coagulant for the treatment of                   potable waters, current approaches are unable to provide a                      prediction of the commonly observed effects of variable mixing and              reactant injection techniques on final aluminum product                         distribution during treatment of drinking waters with aluminum                  coagulants.  This project involves a study of the kinetics of                   aluminum product transformation in near-homogeneous base                        neutralization experiments (stopped-flow technique).  Membrane                  filtration techniques and photon correlation spectroscopy will be               used to monitor the formation of aluminum polymers and precipitate              particles.  The kinetic data will be incorporated in trial kinetic              expressions and combined with specification for large and small                 scale mixing (\"micromixing\") of aluminum and base in turbulent                  reactors.  The predictions of this mathematical model will be                   compared with experimental results for aluminum product speciation              in larger scale aluminum neutralization studies with variable                   mixing and reactant injection techniques.                                                                                                                       Results of this work are likely to be applied toward improving the              engineering design of water and wastewater treatment processes and              systems.",
