 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cosmology came of age as a science during the 20th century                      because of the structuring of cosmological observation and                      theory around the Big Bang model of an expanding, evolving                      universe.  Yet even though Big Bang Cosmology was undeniably                    scientific, it was scientific in a special way:  Theory was                     always much richer than its empirical base.  Hence, finding                     theoretical problems which interacted crucially with the limited                data set was a difficult and delicate problem.  In many                         instances, cosmologists found themselves forced to rely upon very               general metaphysical principles, principles such as \"The                        Uniformity of Nature,\" \"Causality,\" and \"Simplicity,\" as                        decision criteria in the selection among competing problem                      solutions.  Indeed, it can be argued that it was precisely these                sorts of principles which opened the way for today's inflationary               cosmologies.  Big Bang cosmology offers a rich source for                       historians and philosophers of science interested in the                        dynamical interplay between empirical, theoretical and                          philosophical forces during the birth and development of a major                scientific research programme.  Professors Gale and Urani hope to               examine under this study the dynamical interplay of these forces.",
