 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year project seeks to increase black students' interest and            achievement in mathematics and science by improving the quality of the          instruction that they receive in junior high school.  The participants,         who will be 52 underprepared teachers from the Saint Louis area, will           deepen and broaden their knowledge of mathematics and science content,          update their teaching skills and become familiar with instructional uses        of the computer in these disciplines.  During the six-week summer               workshops, the 24 science teachers will take courses in biology,                physical science, and mathematics for science teachers, while the 28            mathematics teachers will take courses in mathematics topics and in             microcomputers.  Both groups will also discuss teaching methodology, as         well as participate in a seminar on issues in minority education.               During the academic year there will be monthly seminars for the                 participants, as well as classroom visitations by the project staff.                                                                                            Visiting consultants, including black chemists and engineers, will              enhance the participants' awareness of issues in minority education and         assist the Principal Investigator in securing community and parental            support for mathematics and science education.  The evaluation will             assess the project's effect on teaching strategies and on students'             attitude and achievement.                                                                                                                                       The project provides a model for other urban areas with large minority          populations to follow in increasing the representation of blacks in             mathematics and science.                                                                                                                                        The university's cost-sharing contribution amounts to 20% of the NSF            award.  The participants' schools will provide additional support for           the project, including computers and instructional materials.",
