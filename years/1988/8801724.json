 "awd_abstract_narration": "The upper atmosphere is irradiated by ultraviolet and X                    radiation from the sun that ionizes and dissociates and                         electronically excites molecules and atoms.  The resulting                      optical emission can be detected at the ground during the morning               and evening twilight periods, when the upper atmosphere is still                being irradiated by the sun but the troposphere is not, so the                  bright blue sky no longer overwhelms the fainter upper                          atmosphere emissions.  The spectrum of the upper atmosphere                     emissions, as detected with modern spectroscopic equipment,                     contains more than enough information to reveal the upper                       atmosphere composition and temperature, and thus the important                  day to day and seasonal solar cycle and magnetic activity                       variations.  An analysis of the data involves comparisons with                  numerical models of the photochemical processes resulting from                  the solar irradiation.                                                               The Aeronomy community through the CEDAR planning document                 have endorsed a program of twilight spectroscopic observations to               provide the composition information.  This award is for a pilot                 program to develop this capability, and involves 5 universities                 and a private company, with experimentalists using several types                of spectrographic equipment, working with theoreticians in a                    cooperative program.",
