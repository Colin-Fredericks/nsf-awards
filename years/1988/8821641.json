 "awd_abstract_narration": "Volcanic aerosols, both fine silicate dust and gas-derived acid                 droplets, are thought to be important in affecting climate by                   reducing the amount of solar radiation reaching the earth's                     surface.  Polar ice cores provide the only medium in which both                 the soluble gas-derived impurities and the insoluble silicate                   particles from volcanic eruptions are preserved.  These volcanic                layers of high acidity can be identified in the ice cores by a                  method of d.c. electrical conductivity.  Petrologic studies of the              sulfur and chlorine content of glass inclusions in phenocrysts of               tephra will be used to estimate the total mass of volatiles                     released in volcanic eruptions.                                                                                                                                 The main objective of the study is to determine the chemical                    composition of ice in layers of high electrical conductivity                    (acidity) in a Greenland ice core due to fallout from certain                   well-known volcanic eruptions and to identify the chemical                      compounds (acids) responsible for the acidity.  Petrologic                      estimates of the volatiles associated with these eruptions will                 also be made in order to compare with the ice core work.",
