 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this research are to improve the design                   and analysis methods currently used for advanced composite rotary-              wing structures.  The outcome of the research involves the                      development of:  (1) a refined structural theory for nonhomogeneous             anisotropic beams, and (2) an optimum design methodology for loaded-            shape-critical applications.  The refined beam theory is developed by           extending existing one-dimensional anisotropic beam theories to                 include the effects of nonhomogeneity and transverse shear.  This               theory, which is an extension of Timoshenko's beam theory, uses an              extended set of shear correction factors that are determined by                 Saint-Venant's elasticity solutions optimization techniques to                  determine the initial shape of a flexible blade weight is minimized,            the stresses and stability boundaries are checked, and the design               variables include the blade geometry and material definition.                   These design methods will impact the future design of rotary-wing               structures.  Composite materials will be used more intelligently and            blade shapes may changes as a result.  Major improvements in blade              propulsive efficiency are possible, which would result in substantial           fuel savings for the next generation of aircraft.",
