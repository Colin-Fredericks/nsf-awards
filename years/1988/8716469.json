 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thymidine is usually incorporated directly into DNA by                  bacterioplankton, but there are a number of environments where it               is extensively metabolized.  South San Francisco Bay, California                (SSFB) is one of these.  Substantial amounts of 3H from methyl-                 \u01313H!-thymidine are found in RNA, protein, and a fraction                        extracted by 80% ethanol.  A much larger proportion of the label                from 6-\u01313H!-thymidine is found in DNA, and none of it appears in                the 80% enthanol. A much larger proportion of the label from 6-                 \u01313H!-thymidine is found in DNA, and none of it appears in the 80%               ethanol extractable fraction.  As a result, bacterial                           productivity estimates differ by factors of up to 10 for the same               sample.  Additional data suggest that isotope dilution analysis                 of precursor pool specific activity doesn't work in SSFB either.                These results are in sharp contrast with Monterey Bay experiments               where thymidine incorporation is \"normal\": the majority goes into               DNA, there is no difference between methyl- and 6-labeled                       thymidine, and isotope dilution seems to work.                                          The proposed study will investigate this phenomenon in                  detail.  The overall goal is to determine the physiological or                  environmental basis for the difference between SSFB and \"normal\"                coastal populations and to use this information to adapt the                    thymidine method to SSFB and other environments where                           bacterioplankton have similar physiologies (meso- and                           bathypelagic waters, other coastal waters, hypolimnia of some                   lakes).  Specific objectives are to test the hypotheses that 1)                 the methyl group is rapidly exchanged with an unlabeled pool in                 the cells, 2) ring carbon or 6-tritiated thymidine will provide                 better estimates of DNA synthesis rates in these environments,                  and 3) the physiological basis for the difference is due to                     larger DNA and TdR fluxes in SSFB and greater dependence of SSFB                bacterioplankton on thymidine  as a carbon, nitrogen and energy                 source relative to \"normal\" coastal populations.",
