 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work covers two main areas of research in high performance                 transaction systems:  structures for integrity and concurrency and              models for analyzing and simulating such systems.  The first area is            concerned with methods for guaranteeing integrity, recoverability and           high performance for transactions having long duration and user                 interaction.  A new level of concurrency control has been introduced to         provide a transaction-like session that would have these properties,            but that would not degrade performance and availability as much as a            true long duration transaction would.  A language for defining and              manipulating this new level of concurrency is being developed.  This            language will be implemented on an elaborate network emulation that has         already been developed.  The second part of the proposed research               concerns the problem of modelling the performance of concurrency                control and buffer management algorithms for database systems.  A new           stochastic model of data access has been introduced.  This model                reflects the observed behavior of real database systems better than the         existing models.  Although access to data granules is highly                    nonuniform, this new model is analytically tractable and easy to                simulate.  A prototype simulator has already been developed, and                various buffer and cache management algorithms are being tested.",
