 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. Stuart A. Lipton and a colleague at                     Children's Hospital Corporation to collaborate in research on retinal           ganglion cells with Dr. Heinz Wassle, Department of Neuroanatomy, Max           Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt, West Germany.  The            general objective of their research is to gain a better understanding           of the interactions of neurotransmitters in the mammalian retina.               The particular objective of their collaboration is to identify the              nature of the chemicals operating in specific synapses onto retinal             ganglion cells.  The U.S. team has developed uniquely successful                techniques for identifying and culturing in vitro mature retinal                ganglion cells from mammals.  They have also adapted the patch-clamp            recording technique to this system.  The German group has perfected             methods to identify and culture in vitro mature retinal bipolar                 cells, a major cell type that synapses onto retinal ganglions, and              they are performing patch-clamp experiments on these bipolar                    neurons.  The use of these two disparate neuronal cell types from the           retina is central to the collaboration; maintaining a particular                neuron in culture from a mature mammalian central nervous system is             quite difficult.  Through joint experiments, they will co-culture the           two types of neurons and produce synapses between them.  Then,                  glutamate-like substances previously found to affect solitary                   ganglion cells will be tested for their effects on endogenous                   synaptic activity in ganglion cells located among clusters of other             retinal cells in cultures.                                                                                                                                      The proposed joint experiments on co-cultured retinal ganglion and              bipolar cells will enable these collaborators to verify the effects             of putative glutamate-like neurotransmitters at synapses.  Their                research should result in characterizing the first known chemical               transmitter between identified neurons entirely within the mammalian            brain.  This will contribute in a significant way to improved                   understanding of the mammalian central nervous system.",
