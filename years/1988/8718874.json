 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will do theoretical research on superconductivity and                    other properties of granular materials.  Studies will be made of                the superconductive glass state; the predicted properties of this               state have been observed by several groups in samples of high Tc                superconducting oxide ceramics, and are the subject of intense                  theoretical and experimental interest.  Other proposed work in                  superconductivity includes studies of the dynamical properties of               superconducting arrays, both ordered and disordered, and with and               without an applied magnetic field, and various properties of                    composite and polycrystalline superconductors.  Additional work                 is proposed in the area of non-linear optical properties but also               including the mechanical properties of a composite of a brittle                 and a ductile material, and on Faraday rotation in granular                     magnetic materials.  The work will be carried out by a variety of               methods including numerical simulations, exact analytic results,                and mean-field theories.",
