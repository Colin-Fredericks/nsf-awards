 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a Joint US-France Seminar on                            Partial Differential Equations and Continuum Models of                          Phase Transitions, to be jointly organized by Prof.                             Marshall Slemrod, University of Wisconsin-Madison, and                          Prof. Michel Rascle, University of Nice, France. The                            seminar, to be held in Nice in January, 1988, will                              bring together researchers from France and the US to                            discuss the formulation and solution of nonlinear                               partial differential equations in the fields of                                 mechanics, metallurgy, and solid state physics.   The                           main subjects to be addressed include crystal defects,                          van der Waals fluids, liquid crystals, numerical                                simulation, and current problems in both solid state                            physics and industrial technology.  Particular                                  emphasis will be placed on problems which evolve in                             time.                                                                                                                                                           It is especially appropriate to hold this seminar in                            France at this time, because 1987-88 has been denoted                           the Special Year of Nonlinear Phenomena by the French                           National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  This                           seminar will focus on solutions to differential                                 equations that arise in the study of phase                                      transitions, which have a nonstandard mathematical                              structure.  Building on recent advances in                                      theoretical, applied, and numerical mathematics, this                           will be the first such seminar to emphasize dynamical                           problems, and should produce results of use in the                              solution of problems in solid-state and semiconductor                           electronics and in fluid mechanics.",
