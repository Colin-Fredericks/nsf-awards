 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent impacts of molecular and cellular biology on the                theoretical framework of every biological subdiscipline are causing             large numbers of undergraduates in this department of enroll in                 cellular and molecular biology courses.  Sophisticated aspects of               molecular and cellular theory presented in lecture require students to          reference the current literature frequently, and to engage in                   appropriate laboratory exercises.  These pressures made previously              available instructional instrumentation grossly inadequate, forcing             the use of obsolete experimental designs.                                                                                                                            This project is alleviating these difficulties by providing two            refrigerated centrifuges, an ultracentrifuge and rotors, an inverted            fluorescence photomicroscope, eight horizontal electrophoresis                  stations, a DNA sequencing system, apparatus for the separation of              chromosome-sized DNA fragments, deep freeze, incubator/shaker, five             UV/VIS recording spectrophotometers, vacuum oven, photographic                  recording system for agarose gels, and a water purification system.             The result is to provide sufficient numbers of modern centrifuges and           spectrophotometers to execute smoothly laboratory experiments on                subcellular fractionation, enzyme reaction kinetics, and molecular              cloning; to permit curricular change in the form of advanced laboratory         exercises such as macromolecular localization and DNA sequencing; and           to make available state-of-the-art instrumentation for student research         projects in all fields of biology.                                                                                                                                   The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
