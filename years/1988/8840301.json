 "awd_abstract_narration": "Those familiar with the weather off the California coast can               attest to the variability of cloudiness.  Sometimes a deck of                   strato-cumulus clouds may persist for hundreds of miles for hours               or days.  At other times such a layer of clouds may form and                    break up within a relatively short period of time.                                   Cloud-top entrainment instability is the mechanism whereby a               stratocumulus deck breaks up into scattered cumulus clouds.  It                 is generally accepted that the onset of the process depends on                  the temperature and mixing ratio discontinuity across the                       inversion.  That is, whenever the equivalent potential                          temperature difference is smaller than a critical value, the                    inversion is unstable and entrainment can occur freely.  However,               recent evidence suggests that despite this instability the cloud                deck may remain solid.  This requires that other mechanisms                     sustain the entrainment instability; some examples include                      turbulence within the cloud layer, coupling between the cloud and               subcloud layers, and shear induced entrainment.  Under this                     grant, Dr. David Rogers will study these physical mechanisms                    using a mesoscale model of the planetary boundary layer over the                ocean.  The results should increase our understanding of the                    evolution of marine stratocumulus.",
