 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intracellular digestion is a basic function of cells.  The                 membranes enclosing the digestive compartments protect the cell                 from the toxic chemicals, microorganisms, and extreme acidity,                  and are involved in transport of nutrients into the cell's                      cytosol.  In Paramecia, these functions are carried out                         efficiently in the digestive vacuoles by the sequential addition                and/or retrieval of several morphologically and functionally                    distinct pools of membrane vesicles: discoidal vesicles, which                  provide membranes for vacuole formation; acidosomes, which are                  involved in acidification of the digestive vacuoles;and                         lysosomes, which contain the acid hydrolases responsible for                    macromolecular digestion.  The degraded products are transported                from within the digestive vacuoles to the cytosol, to be used for               the cell's growth.                                                                   These various intracellular membrane-bound compartments will               be separately isolated and biochemically characterized, using a                 variety of approaches including monoclonal antibodies, free-flow                electrophoresis, gradient density centrifugation, magnetic                      separation, in vitro fusion studies, pulse-chase experiments, and               lysosomotropic drugs.  The results of these studies will not only               provide us with a better understanding of how intracellular                     digestion is carried out and regulated in phagocytic                            protozoa, but will also provide important new insights into the                 fundamental problem of eukaryotic intracellular membrane                        trafficking and compartmentalization in general.",
