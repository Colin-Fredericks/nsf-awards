 "awd_abstract_narration": "Elucidation of the biochemical mechanisms involved in the                      storage of information in the nervous system is a fundamental                   problem in neurobiology.  Studies of the processes underlying the               phenomenon of long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic                          transmission at excitatory synapses elicited by brief bursts of                 high frequency stimulation have identified several components                   postulated to play a critical role in the way some patterns of                  electrical activity can alter the efficacy of synaptic                          transmission.  In particular, the properties of one subclass of                 receptors for the acidic amino acid, L-glutamate, appear to be                  responsible for the induction of LTP in some telencephalic                      pathways, while the long-term changes in synaptic efficacy might                depend on the activation of a calcium-dependent protease                        (calpain) and the partial proteolysis of a cytoskeletal protein,                fodrin or brain spectrin.  We have developed new techniques to                  study both the recognition site and the functional properties of                different classes of glutamate receptors and have identified a                  number of regulatory mechanisms that could underlie various types               of physiological plasticity.  More specifically, we can now study               the properties of the recognition sites for at least 3 classes of               glutamate receptors using binding techniques and various radio-                 labeled 3H-ligands.  The functional properties of the same                      receptors in the same membrane fractions can also be studied                    following their reconstitution in artificial lipid bilayers.  The               specific goals of the present proposal are to i) determine the                  functional characteristics of adult glutamate receptors                         reconstituted in artifical lipid bilayers; ii) determine the                    regulatory mechanisms involved in glutamate receptor function                   using biochemical and biophysical techniques; iii) study the                    possibility that local dendritic synthesis of specific proteins                 is involved in the maintenance of LTP; and iv) test the                         involvement of specific biochemical mechanisms in LTP and                       learning and memory.  It is our hope that these studies will                    provide a more detailed description of the biochemical events                   occurring during learning as well as new pharmacological tools to               specifically manipulate these processes.                                         ***//",
