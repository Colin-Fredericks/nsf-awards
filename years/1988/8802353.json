 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is the continuation of a study using a               combination of immunochemistry, protein chemistry, and molecular                biology to ascertain the properties of immunoglobulins of                       primitive species and to identify and characterize the genes                    specifying them.  Particular attention will be given to                         rearranging elements (variable, joining and constant regions),                  the multiplicity of these elements, and their arrangement.  The                 focus of future studies will be:  1. characterization of Ig light               chains of two carcharhine sharks, the tiger shark (Galeocerdo                   cuvieri) and the sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus)                          (elasmobranchs), and 2. completion of the characterization of                   genes of a teleost fish (the goldfish, Carassius auratus) that                  are homologous to human V beta gene sequences.  One goldfish V                  beta homolog has already been characterized and will serve as a                 probe for screening of genomic and cDNA libraries of lower                      species and, potentially, of protochordates.  Extremely little is               known about the protein structure of shark light chains and                     nothing is known of the details of lamprey Ig or putative                       protoimmunoglobulins such as that found in the tunicate.                        Similarly, little is known about the genes encoding these                       proteins--the types of elements, their multiplicity, their                      sequence, and their arrangement.  The goldfish V beta gene                      fragment described here represents the first example of the                     isolation of an Ig-like T cell receptor gene from a non-mammalian               species.                                                                            Immunoglobulin molecules belong to a family of proteins that                are involved in self-recognition and self-defense in all                        vertebrates and possibly in some invertebrates.  The best known                 member of the immunoglobulin family of molecules are the                        antibodies.  The evolution of the immunoglobulins is not                        understood and, until recently, had been studied very little.                   The information to be obtained from this research will allow us                 to draw meaningful conclusions regarding the variable and                       constant region structure of immunoglobulins of primitive                       vertebrate species and should shed light upon the genetic events                underlying the origins of this important family of molecules.",
