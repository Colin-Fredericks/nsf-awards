Miller of Temple University and Dr. Russell Babcock, Mr. Peter                  Harrison and Ms. Bette Willis of the James Cook University,                     Townsville, Australia related to the multi-species, mass spawning               of corals on the Great Barrier Reef.  Eggs and sperm collected                  during mass spawnings at several locations will be subjected to                 laboratory observation and manipulation to determine (1) what                   prevents self-fertilization in the sperm/egg bundles released by                hermaphroditic corals and (2) the mechanisms which prevent                      hybridization when large numbers of species spawn simultaneously.               The timing of egg maturation in relation to spawning will be                    determined by direct observation.  Sperm chemotaxis, and its                    species specificity, will be evaluated by observing the behavior of             sperm when exposed to single and multiple species' egg extracts.                                                                                                The mass multi-species spawning of corals is an important                       phenomenon in the ecology of the Great Barrier Reef.  The                       Australian investigators, as part of the Coral Reproduction Group               at James Cook University, provide the project with extensive                    working knowledge of the Great Barrier Reef corals, as well as                  excellent laboratory and support facilities.  Dr. Miller is a                   seasoned developmental biologist and a leading specialist on                    sperm-egg chemotaxis.",
