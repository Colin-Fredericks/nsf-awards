 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Sanders will conduct synoptic research in three                  areas through analysis of observations. The first is the                        development of organized systems of deep cumulonimbus clouds,                   which produce many dangerous and damaging phenomena ranging                     from heavy rain to tornadoes.  Professor Sanders will study                     where, when, and why they form, in and near the United States,                  using existing hourly maps over two to three years of                           persistent intense radar echoes, and using a special set of                     sounding and other data in the central United States for a                      particular case.  The second is the development of frontal                      systems, both near the surface and in the higher tropospheric                   levels.  Professor Sanders will look at a form of sloping roll                  circulation that often develops as part of the process of                       frontal formation and is responsible for lines of heavy rainfall                with little precipitation between and for alternating vertical                  layers of saturated and very dry air.  The third is a further                   study of the development of cyclonic storms near the surface.                   Both the initial formation aloft and the later influence on                     events at low levels will be examined.",
