 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research proposes direct tests of the applicability of                resource-based competition theory to turbid aquatic ecosystems.                 It is hypothesized that experimental gradients of nitrogen,                     phosphorus, and clay turbidity will lead to predictable and                     repeatable changes in phytoplankton community structure in 0.33                 cubic meter laboratory tanks.  Subsequent field tests will be                   made to determine whether these trends can be repeated using in                 situ enclosures.  Moreover, this research recognizes the                        potential importance of sedimentation losses in determining                     phytoplankton community structure, and will quantify their                      effects.                                                                             Because measurements will also be made of zooplankton                      biomass and community structure, this research also complements                 ongoing studies of the effects of nutrients and inorganic                       suspended matter on aquatic food webs, currently being made                     elsewhere.  It is intended that the proposed research will                      provide additional information on the ecological effects of                     suspended sediments, and will allow us to better predict the                    impact of future nutrient and erosion controls.  This research                  should thus assist in the development of rational guidelines for                the control of non-point source pollution to freshwater lakes and               reservoirs.",
