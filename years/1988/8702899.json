 "awd_abstract_narration": "Old stellar populations in galaxies will be studied and used as                 cosmological probes.  The work falls logically into two areas:                  the study of old stellar populations and integrated spectra per                 se and the use of old stellar populations, specifically                         elliptical (E) and spherical (SO) galaxies, as tracers of                       irregularities in the local Hubble expansion of the universe.  In               the latter work, a project using E galaxies that has given                      evidence of a bulk motion at 600-700 km s-1 with respect to the                 cosmic restframe of a large sphere of galaxies around us out to                 6000 km s-1 in radius will be expanded.  This motion of the                     galaxies could provide a powerful constraint on cosmological                    theories and needs to be tested and probed in every possible way.               To this end, a comprehensive analysis of N-body universe models                 as a means to illuminate potential pitfalls in Hubble flow                      studies of this type will be carried out.  Completely new and                   independent estimates of the motions of nearby SO galaxies will                 be obtained to compare with those of Es.                                                                                                                        In the area of old stellar populations, a project will be                       continued to determine the metallicities and element abundance                  ratios in E galaxies and globular clusters.  An empirical                       calibration of absorption-line features in G dwarf and K giant                  stars versus temperature, abundance, and surface gravity will be                completed.  These results will be compared to theoretical                       synthetic spectra, and, when a satisfactory understanding of                    stellar spectra is achieved, there will be a synthesizing of                    integrated spectra of galaxies.  Long-slit spectra of elliptical                galaxies will also be analyzed for radial abundance gradients,                  and new, high-quality, high-resolution stellar spectra will be                  used to explore small composition differences among globular                    cluster stars.",
