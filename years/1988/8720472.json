 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent research as formulated a preliminary procedure, based               on heliotropism in Australian (Bitter Springs) columnar                         stromatolites, that has an exciting potential for deducing ancient              Earth-Sun-Moon dynamics and plate movements over most of the                    Earth's existence.  The heliotropic model is supported by                       observations of heliotropism in present day stromatolites forming               in the hot springs at Yellowstone National Parks and in Shark Bay,              Western Australia.  There is considerable evidence that                         stromatolite laminae (ancient and present) often represent day-                 night sequences, which combined with observed sinusoidal columnar               growth patterns due to changing seasonal solar inclination                      (annual) provides information of days per year, lunar distance,                 obliquity of the ecliptic, etc.  Preservation of the paleomagnetic              field combined with the spin-axis north-south direction of the                  heliotropically inclined columns provides information on magnetic               pole and continental plate locations and orientations.  Useful                  paleomagnetic fields have been observed in random selection of                  stromatolite columns of various minerals and ages.  Research                    objectives for the first year's effort are: 1) conduct a                        literature and letter search to formalize locations and geological              ages of useful columnar stromatolites on each continent, 2)                     collect specimens from a second site known to have columnar                     stromatolites with probably utility (Tindir region, east-central                Alaska), 3) perform laboratory analyses of existing specimens from              central Australia and specimens from the Tindir region in Alaska,               4) monitor stromatolitic growth at Yellowstone as a function of                 environmental factors.  The second year will include analytical                 modeling of geophysical parameters using stromatolitic evidence.",
