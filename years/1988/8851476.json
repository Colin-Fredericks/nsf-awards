 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides two state-of-the-art microcomputer systems to             replace obsolete PDP-11 minicomputers and associated first generation           microprocessor trainers.  These systems are networked to a basic and an         advanced microprocessor training laboratory.  Each laboratory                   incorporates 12 workstations; consisting of a terminal, an Educational          Computer Board and a solderless breadboard for experiments.  The basic          laboratory uses an 8-bit microprocessor and is used to instruct                 electronic engineering technology majors and non-majors; including              future technology education teachers.  The advanced laboratory is used          to provide instruction in microprocessor systems to the four-year               graduates of the Electronic Engineering Technology and the Industrial           Electronics Programs.   This laboratory upgrade significantly improves          the quality of education offered by the Department of Industrial and            Engineering Technology by proving common equipment throughout the               laboratory program and increased laboratory productivity through better         hardware and software reliability.                                                                                                                                 This award is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.",
