 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year collaborative project in neutron             physics under the U.S.-Austria Cooperative Science Program.  The U.S.           investigators are Professor Herbert J. Bernstein, Hampshire College;            Professor Michael A. Horne, Stonehill College; and Professor Clifford           G. Shull, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Hampshire College.          Their Austrian collaborators are Professor Dr. Helmut Rauch and                 Professor Dr. Anton Zeilinger, both of the Atomic Institute of the              Austrian Universities, Vienna.  The cooperative project will focus on           very cold neutron (VCN) experiments and on the development of neutron           Fresnel lenses.  Previous neutron optics experimentation has made use           of neutrons in two energy regions, so-called thermal neutrons and               ultra-cold neutrons.  A source of intermediate-energy neutrons,                 referred to as very cold neutrons, will soon be available at the                Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) High Flux Reactor in Grenoble, France,             where much of the work of the Austrian researchers in this project is           carried out.  The availability of neutrons in this energy range,                corresponding to neutron wavelengths of 80 to 100 Angstroms, will allow         the cooperating scientists to perform various fundamental experiments           and to extend their previous research to this interesting new                   wavelength region.  Professors Bernstein and Horne will provide                 theoretical support of these VCN experiments.  The second project               involves a cooperative study of neutron Fresnel lenses, with a view             toward achieving workable lenses for focusing a neutron beam.  The U.S.         and Austrian groups have carried out complementary research and design          activities directed toward the development of such lenses.  By                  combining their respective efforts, the scientists expect to hasten the         attainment of this goal.                                                                                                                                        These experiments and their associated theoretical investigations are           expected to increase our understanding of the basic properties of               neutrons and their interaction with matter.  The neutron is the most            massive particle yet used to routinely demonstrate wave-like                    properties.  This makes neutron interferometry one of the most                  sensitive probes of matter, and it is thus an extremely useful tool for         studying fundamental quantum physics.",
