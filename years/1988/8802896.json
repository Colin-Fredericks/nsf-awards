 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of the location and demographic characteristics of              households that have purchased earthquake insurance in California.  The         location of a sample of households with and without earthquake insurance        for both northern and southern California will be compared with geologic        characteristics (such as proximity to the San Andreas fault) to                 determine the existence of adverse selection.  This portion of the study        will utilize a major geographic information system to plot the location         of 5000 or more households and compare them to geologic characteristics         as well as census tract information.  The second part of the study will         involve a sample survey of households with and without insurance in             order to ascertain the economic and demographic characteristics that            differentiate these two populations.  The two portions of the research          will provide important baseline data upon which a better understanding          of recent shifts in household-level decision-making with respect to             earthquake insurance purchase will be obtained and will also provide            information on which more enlightened policy can be based.",
