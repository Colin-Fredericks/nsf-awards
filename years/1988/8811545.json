 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this research effort are to enhance the power          density capabilities of the lithium iodine (PZVP) battery system and            to provide an in-depth understanding of the role of the cathode in the          battery rate limiting mechanism particularly with respect to discharge          current.                                                                        The plan of research is as follows.  First the batteries will be                fabricated employing the new cathode preparation procedure.  General            discharge behavior at low rates will be determined for comparison to            conventional batteries.  High rate discharge performance will then be           evaluated.  In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the cathode               modification a number of methods will be utilized.  Laser holographic           interferometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy will be used          in-situ to monitor the uniformity of discharge and the lithium iodide           electrolyte conductivity respectively.  Post-test scanning electron             microscopy will be employed to determine the influence of the                   modification on discharte product formation and correlation with in-            situ testing results.  Depending on the results obtained further                cathode preparation modifications may be included.                              Potentially an order of magnitude increase in power delivery                    capability is attainable by modifying cell chemistry and manufacturing          procedure.  This enhanced battery system could find new application in          a broader class of implant devices including multi-input/output                 programmable pacemakers, implantable defibrillators, implantable drug           delivery systems as well as other important industrial and deep space           applications.",
