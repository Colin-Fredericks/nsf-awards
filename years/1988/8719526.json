 "awd_abstract_narration": "Relativistic nuclear field theories are being studied as                   an alternative to the description of the nucleus as a classical                 quantum many-body system.  Particular effort is being directed                  at the problem of accurately calculating quantum corrections to                 the mean field equations and identifying signatures of such                     corrections in experimental data.  The problem of correctly                     incorporating the pion into quantum hadrodynamics (QHD), where                  the fundamental constituents are taken as baryons and mesons,                   is also a major objective.  This problem is closely related to                  the calculation of quantum corrections, and it provides a                       vehicle for exploring several nonperturbative approaches.                            This research is directed toward the development of a                      description of the nucleus which properly incorporates                          subnucleonic particles and interactions discovered in high                      reactions and seeks to unify nuclear physics to the unifying                    theory of quantum chromodynamics.",
