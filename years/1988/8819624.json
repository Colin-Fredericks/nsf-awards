 "awd_abstract_narration": "New automatic theorem proving techniques are examined and evalu-                ated by foundationally verifying well known theorems in pure                    mathematics.  The investigator has already used object-oriented                 inference techniques to verify the Stone representation theorem                 for Boolean lattices from the axioms of set theory.  The new                    inference techniques are evaluated by measuring the amount of                   user-given detail needed to foundationally verify Bledsoe's ten                 challenge problems.  The inference techniques to be evaluated                   include new forward chaining constraint propagation techniques, a               forward chaining mechanism for mathematical induction, automated                focus control for object-oriented inference, and a sound mechan-                ism for verifying and applying user-defined algorithms.                                                                                                         Automatic reasoning is one of the central problems of artificial                intelligence, with potential for application in software and                    hardware verification, deductive data retrieval, online docu-                   mentation systems, and computer-aided instruction in mathematics                and the sciences.  This research seeks to establish that auto-                  matic inference can be used in practice and that progress is                    being made toward ever more effective methods.",
