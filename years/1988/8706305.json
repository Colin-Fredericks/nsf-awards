 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Rochester Museum and Science Center seeks support to purchase               storage equipment and equip a conservation laboratory,  This equipment          will be used to house the museum's 1,000,000 item collection of                 historic Senecas-Iroquois archaeological materials.  This systematic            collection was excavated over a 65-year period and includes material            from every known Seneca village of the 1550-1820 A.D. period.  While            the collections are already heavily used, the improvements in storage           facilities in light of updated collections management techniques, will          make them available to an even wider anthropological community.                 The museum has a long-standing commitment to its collections.  It is            currently constructing a new storage and research facility that will            replace and significantly improve the existing facility and equipment           that was built in 1940.  It is anticipated that the new storage                 facility and collections maintenance plan will stop the rapid rate of           deterioration  currently affecting the collection.                              This collection is a major scientific resource and a primary anthropol-         ogical data base.  It is unique for researchers in that it represents           the only sequence for a major northeastern tribe which is unbroken and          which contains sufficient materials from multiple sites to allow                extensive documentation and comparisons.  The materials tell anthropol-         ogists a great deal about contact between Native Americans and Europe-          ans and are the principle resource for interpreting Seneca-Iroquois             culture throughout a period of rapid change.",
