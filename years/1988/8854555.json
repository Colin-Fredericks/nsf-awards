 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to restructure the first half of the           engineering curriculum in terms of objectives, content, and                     instructional methodology.  The content is organized in three new               interwoven areas: Fundamentals of Engineering (FE); Mathematical and            Scientific Foundations of Engineering (MSFE); and Engineering                   Laboratory (EL).  FE changes, unifies,integrates and presents in a              different way the material now contained in several courses in several          departments.  MSFE changes, unifies, integrates and presents in a               different way the material now contained in several courses in                  mathematics, chemistry, physics and biology.  EL provides significant           new experiences in laboratory theory and practice.  Central to the              changes is that the three areas are coupled and synchronized to                 complement one another.  This manner of organizing the content is               expected to be more effective for student learning and more efficient           in the use of student time.  This should allow more material to be              included in this part of the curriculum and help the student to                 understand better the interrelationships between the various topics.            Methods for presentation are heavily oriented toward interactive                computer use and the use of electronic media.  Both content and                 methodology focus on the fundamentals of engineering as the unifying            theme, the intimate relations with science and mathematics, and the             reliance on experimental methods.  The co-op program introduces a new           area called Professional and Personal Enrichment (PPE).  This area              focuses on developing a culture for life-long learning by providing a           variety of self-directed enriching educational experiences.  Matching           funds commited by the institution exceed NSF funds for this project.",
