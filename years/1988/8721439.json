The instrument will greatly benefit the                       research of six young members of the Biology Departament at West                Virginia University who are engaged in a variety of molecular                   biological studies.  Studies include:  examination of the                       formation of 3-methyladenine in DNA and its repair at a                         biochemical and molecular level including isolation of the gene                 for the repair enzyme 3MA-DNA glycosylase; molecular analysis of                the structure and regulation of the Drosophila gene cubitus                     interruptus with the long-term goal of understanding the nature                 of heterochromatin and euchromatin; molecular analysis of a                     developmentally regulated actin gene in the sea urchin as a means               of understanding temporal and spatial gene regulation during                    development; characterization of the pheromones involved in                     sexual differentiation and mutational and subsequent molecular                  analysis of the genes involved in sexual development of the                     fungus Phycomyces blakesleeanus; molecular analysis of the turtle               delta-crystallin and tau-crystallin genes with the goal of                      understanding how these proteins are produced in such large                     quantities during lens differentiation; and investigation of                    glycosyltransferase activity in cell membranes from cultured                    human colonic epithelial cells and analysis of the mRNA                         population from colon tissue.  Support is strongly recommended.",
