 "awd_abstract_narration": "Processes affecting the pigment content, spectral                          absorption, and photochemical properties of biogenic detritus                   derived from phytoplankton will be investigated.  It is                         hypothesized that the rates of photooxidation of detrital                       chlorophylls, pheopigments, and carotenoids are coupled                         through a degradation, and the question of mechanism will be                    addressed in laboratory experiments, some employing a model                     system for detrital pigments.  The effect of grazer community                   composition on the spectral character of biogenic detritus                      will be examined.  Pigment content, spectral absorption, and                    the rates of light-dependent pigment bleaching will be                          determined for the particulate wastes of copepods and                           heterothrophic protozoans.  Pigments will be analyed by high                    performance liquid chromatography.  Particulate absorption                      spectra (filtered material) will be partitioned into                            component spectra by solvent extraction.  The potential                         absorption of a relatively light-stable detrital fraction, of                   humic-like spectral character, will be assessed.                                     The microscopic plants that are responsible for most                       of the ocean's biological production contain pigments for                       absorbing sunlight just as their terrestrial counterparts do.                   These pigments have long been used to quantify marine                           phytoplankton through direct chemical analysis of the amount                    of chlorophyll present in a given body of water.  Recently,                     the discovery that phytoplankton distributions can be measured                  remotely based on the color they impart to the water has                        opened up exciting opportunities for the large scale analysis                   of marine production.  Nelson's work on the pigment                             differences associated with various marine grazing                              environments may result in the ability to extract much more                     ecological information from remotely collected optical                          data than just the static differences in plant biomass.  The                    approach of examining the mechanisms of pigment degration may                   allow for the actual analysis of biological dynamics such as                    marine food web dynamics and particle flux.",
