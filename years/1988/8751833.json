 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a broad expansion of a program that has had ten years of                successful piloting and tryouts throughout the country, but particularly        in California. It had some previous National Science Foundation and U.          S. Department of Education funding.                                                                                                                             This garden-based program for grades K-6 will expand the proposers'             current life science program into a comprehensive elementary science            program. It offers an explicit plan to involve students in a substantial        number of good hands-on experiences; and it offers teachers friendly and        manageable materials. The materials for hands-on work are not only              familiar to most teachers, but in terms of their quantities and cost,           are both affordable and manageable.                                                                                                                             The Life Lab Science Program integrates conceptual learning and                 practical applications to demonstrate to students how science relates to        everyday life. They learn, for example, how their bodies, like plants,          need nutrients that are available from various sources. This learning is        gained through chemical experiments with, and data analysis of,                 nutrients in soil. A variety of learnings are derived from this work,           including some relating to ecology, ethical issues, and decision-making.                                                                                        Roberta M. Jaffe and Gary W. Appel, the Co-Principal Investigators, of          Life Lab Science Program, Inc. (a non-profit organization), will have           the support of their own staff and advisors, schools from around the            country, and a major educational publisher. Addison-Wesley Publishing           Company will provide strong staff and financial support from development        through dissemination and teacher training, and assures potential for           broad use of this program in our schools.                                                                                                                       Addison-Wesley will provide support in the amount of $2,238,500.                                                                                                This proposal was submitted in response to the Program Solicitation,            \"Programs for Elementary School Science Instruction II,\" which                  encourages \"troika\" partnerships among publishers, school systems, and          scientists/science educators.",
