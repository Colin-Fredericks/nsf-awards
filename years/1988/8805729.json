 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nucleotide sequence data from DNA and RNA have become the                  most exciting basis on which to infer evolutionary relationships.               However, biologists currently are better able to generate these                 data than to analyze them, owing to the lack of appropriate and                 well-tested statistical methods.  Dr. James Cavender is a                       mathematician interested in the use of these data for                           constructing evolutionary trees, and he proposes an algebraic                   analysis of a new technique authored recently by Dr. James Lake.                This new approach (\"evolutionary parsimony\") takes into account                 the different probabilities associated with different types of                  nucleotide change.  The proposed research would explore the                     limits of this new method, establish the asumptions on which it                 is based, and the degree to which these statistical assumptions                 are true.                                                                            The proposed research has the potential for openning a new                 approach to the use of nucleotide sequence data.  Developing and                testing this method would have wide impact in systematic and                    evolutionary biology, and in genetics, molecular biology, and                   biochemistry as well.",
