 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed investigation includes theoretical and computational               studies. The underlying concept was presented earlier by the author.            The idea stems from the geometrical nature of the deformations which            often occur in thin shells, plates, arches and beams; these                     deformations are usually characterized by small strains but often               accompanied by finite rotations.  These features have far-reaching              consequences in the contemporary procedures for approximating such              structures by the method of finite elements.  Since the strains are             small, relative rotations are small within elements.  Consequently,             one can describe the deformations of the individual element by linear           equations and, if the material is hookean, the entire description of            the element is given by linear equations.  Then the occurrence of               finite rotations and the associated nonlinearities can be introduced            in the formation of the global matrix.                                          The foregoing observations suggest practical advantages in the                  application and formulation of the models which are used to describe            the thin structures and to predict their response.  However, many               questions remain unanswered, questions about the accuracy of such               formulation, applicability of convergence criteria, and practical               advantages and disadvantages of such procedures.  The purpose of the            proposal is to seek the answers by scrutinizing the theoretical                 bases, the alternative functionals, stationary and/or extremal                  criteria.  Recent                                                               formulations of the complementary functionals provide means to                  that end.  Computational programs for numerical and symbolic                    investigations are other means for exploring and for testing the                practicality of the results.",
