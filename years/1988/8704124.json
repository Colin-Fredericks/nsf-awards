 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to investigate how the virulent satellite RNA C                      intensifies the symptoms of its helper virus, Turnip Crinkle                    Virus (TCV).  RNA C differs from the TCV avirulent satellites RNA               D and RNA F primarily by the presence of a 3'TCV-homologous                     domain.  We will analyze whether this 3' domain is responsible                  for satellite symptom production by infecting turnip with                       chimeric transcripts composed of the avirulent satellites linked                to the 3' domain of RNA C, and assaying for infectivity and                     symptoms.  We will also create a comprehensive set of site-                     specific mutations throughout RNA C in order to further specify                 the region(s) of the satellite involved in symptom production.                  By determining the secondary structure of RNA C, we will                        correlate disruption of secondary structure with satellite                      replication and plant disease morphology.  We will test two                     models for RNA C's mode of action:  l) RNA C binds to cellular                  factor(s) thereby acting to titrate out these factors necessary                 for basic cellular metabolism or, 2) RNA C aneals to putative                   plant U7 RNA and thereby interfers with histone mRNA processing                 leading to plants with a diseased morphology.  This second model                is based on the observation that RNA C is complementary to 83% of               sea urchin U7 RNA.  This study will lay the groundwork for                      establishing the molecular basis of disease production in plants                by small non-protein coding RNAs.",
