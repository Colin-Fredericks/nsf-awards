 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to study the regulation of organ-specific                    gene expression in plants.  The mechanisms are most easily                      conceptualized as trans-acting factors that interact with                       some cis-acting sequence determinants.  In this proposal we                     detail experiments designed to molecularly clone and                            characterize both cis-acting and trans-acting factors                           responsible for organ-specific gene expression in tobacco.                      Sytems allowing the in vitro purification and manipulation of                   genes and their subsequent reintroduction into cells are                        required.  the totipotency of plants and existence of                           efficient transformation systems make plants excellent model                    systems for such studies.  Tobacco genomic clones that have                     been isolated are expressed at high levels specifically in                      either leaves or roots.  Putative regulatory regions from                       these genes will be fused to a reporter gene and these                          constructions transformed into tobaco cells via                                 Agrobacterium-mediated vectors.  After plant regeneration,                      the organ-specific expression of the reporter gene will be                      determined.  Some of the regulatory regions are likely to                       confer organ-specific gene expression and will be further                       analyzed.  A generalized cloning strategy will be developed                     that allows the isolation of cDNA clones encoding proteins                      that bind particular DNA sequences.  A system in which the                      precise limits of the DNA binding sequence need not be known                    has been sought.  In fact, regions of several hundred base                      pairs may be used.  The selection system exploits an                            observation that the binding of a protein between an Upstream                   Activating Sequence (UAS) and the GAL1 gene of yeast                            interrupts GAL1 expression.  With this system cDNA libraries                    may be screened for specific trans-acting factors.  This                        system may be used in concert with defined cis-acting                           sequences to identify and characterize trans-acting factors                     responsible for organ-specific gene expression.                                                                                                                 Although all cells of an organism contain the same DNA, it is                   clear that genes are expressed selectively in different                         cells.  Some situations have been defined that implicate                        specific DNA regions, named enhancers, and specific factors                     which interact with those enhancer regions as controlling                       regions and factors for such differential expression.                           However, the development of a system as described above could                   vastly increase the rate of obtaining such information.",
