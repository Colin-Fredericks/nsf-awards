 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pigments found in the membranes of certain bacteria are of                  a chemical nature surprisingly like that of pigments employed                   in the chemistry of vision in animals. The bacterial pigments                   clearly have a much different function than do the                              corresponding pigments found in the human eye. However, some of                 the fundemental reactions in both systems are very similar in                   nature.  This project in the Organic and Macromolecular                         Chemistry Program is designed to investigate the basic                          chemistry of the biological function of these bacterial                         pigments.                                                                                                                                                       At least three membrane proteins possessing retinal as the                      chromophore have been isolated from the ancient bacterium                       Halobacterium halobium:  bacteriorhodopsin (bR) which pumps                     protons across the membrane, halorhodopsin (hR) which                           translocates chloride ions across the membrane, and sensory                     rhodopsin (sR) which is responsible for the phototactic                         behavior of H. halobium.  Because the bacteria are grown in                     concentrated sodium chloride solution without much fear of                      contamination, and because the above-mentioned pigments are                     among the simplest of membrane proteins, they are ideally                       suited for studying membrane related phenomena.  The pigments                   are thus attracting wide interest from the various scientific                   disciplines.  The objective is to investigate the mechanism of                  the pigment functions on a molecular structural basis, the                      approach being studies on pigment analogs that have been                        incorporated with various synthetic retinals and/or labeled                     amino acids.  The main targets are:  (i) determination of the                   tertiary structure of bR by photoaffinity labeling and other                    means; (ii) delineation of structural factors of the                            chromophoric moiety required for proton pumping in bR; and                      (iii) clarification of the sequence of events occurring within                  bR leading to the transfer of protons.  Related studies with sR                 and hR will also be performed.  Fourier transform infrared                      (FTIR) difference spectroscopy as well as other spectroscopic                   techniques will be used.  Such studies will contribute to our                   understanding of membrane transport, a central but little                       understood theme.",
