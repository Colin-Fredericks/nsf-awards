 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable collaborative research between                           Dr. Richard Radtke of the University of Hawaii and                              Dr. Robert Gauldie of the Fisheries Research Center, Ministry of                Agriculture and Fisheries, Wellington, New Zealand.  They will                  conduct research aimed at extracting life history and physiological             information on fish from structural and chemical analyses of fish               otoliths.  Yearly, daily and population rhythmic patterns in fish               maintained under experimental conditions will be correlated with                otolith macro- and micro-structure as observed by light and                     scanning electron microscopy.  Chemical analyses of otolith                     carbonate for stable isotopic and elemental concentrations will be              used to examine experimentally entrained changes in chemistry which             in wild fish would constitute the history of an individual fish.                Microprobe analyses will be used to interpret short-term changes in             temperature.                                                                                                                                                    The combination of structural and chemical analyses of fish                     otoliths can potentially yield life history profiles for individual             fish, together with information on the environmental history of the             fish.  Such information will increase our understanding of the                  processes underlying recruitment and growth rate and would make it              possible to link growth and mortality rates to nutritional and                  environmental occurrences.  The analytical equipment available in               Dr. Gauldie's laboratory, together with the complementary skills of             Drs. Gauldie and Radtke, make this collaborative effort                         particularly attractive.",
