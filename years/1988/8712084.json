 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical and computational studies on the important                          classic problem of the dynamics of galactic gas flows and the                   roles played by the gas in the structure and dynamics of galaxies               will be carried out.  Normal and barred spiral galaxies will be a               major focus of the research of the wealth of improved and                       detailed observational data that has become available in recent                 years, now making possible new definitive tests and comparisons                 with observations.  Cloud-particle galactic gas dynamics and                    continuum gas dynamics are essential in the multipronged program                of research.  Detailed simulations of full galactic disks and                   higher resolution simulations of selected local regions will be                 studied in parallel to better understand the relationship between               grand design and local spiral arm morphologies.  The effects of                 self gravitation among clouds, magnetic field interactions, and                 star formation processes will also be primary areas of focus.                   The local effective viscosity of the cloud is determined                        from the cloud-particle simulations and used to produce a                       generalized continuum gas dynamical description of galactic gas                 flows that properly simulates the average transport properties of               the cloudy interstellar medium (ISM).  The utilization of                       computational simulation in this work is a topic of great                       significance at the present time and is a separate major thrust                 area.  The high spatial resolution of the simulations will be                   utilized to make definitive comparisons with observations and                   provide careful tests for theoretical predictions based on local                stability analyses.",
