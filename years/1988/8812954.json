 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological processes can produce large quantities of ethanol,                   i-propanol, lactic acid, and 1-Butanol at moderate cost from renewable          biological resources.  The acid catalyzed dehydration of these                  bioproducts in supercritical water can result in high yields of the             important high value petrochemicals ethylene, propylene, acrylicacid,           and 1-Butene at pressures exceeding 22 MPa.  Thus these industrially            important monomers can be produced from dilute aqueous phase solutions          of the biological substrate at pressures appropriate for the direct             synthesis of polymeric plastics, such as polyethylene and                       polypropylene.  Similarly, furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural can            be obtained from pentoses and hexoses in high yields.  These                    furaldehydes are used industrially to synthesize resins.                        Unfortunately, parasitic reactions compete to consume the                       bio-substrate and reduce the yield of the high-value monomer.  The              objectives of this research are to identify the mechanisms and                  kinetics of these competing reactions in order to determine conditions          and catalysts which optimize yields of the double bond forming                  dehydration reactions.  The key element of this work is its emphasis            of near and supercritical water as a reaction medium.                                                                                                           Hawaii and many of the developing tropical countries (such as Thailand          and the Philippines) could enjoy a resurgence of their agricultural             economies if higher value uses for the fermentation                             products of sucrose were identified.  Similarly, Nebraska,                      Kansas, Iowa, and other mid-western states would benefit from                   alternative, higher value uses for ethanol, lactic acid, and                    other fermentation products of the corn products industry.  The                 production of plastics, resins, and petrochemical intermediates                 from bio-materials is perhaps the most promising option for                     improving the economics of sugar- and corn-based agricultural                   economies.  Prior work has revealed the promise of catalysis in                 supercritical water as a new method for producing petrochemicals from           bio-materials.  This research will lay the foundation for                       industry to exploit this new reaction chemistry.",
