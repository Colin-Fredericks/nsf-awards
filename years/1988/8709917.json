 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Marshall Islands are a major morphologic and geologic               feature of the western Pacific.  Their origin has been ascribed                 to the passage of the Mesozoic Pacific plate over hotspots or,                  alternately, to the occurrence of widespread, mid-plate                         volcanism.  Drilling on Bikini and Enewetak atolls, surveying and               dredging on neighboring seamounts and guyots, and ocean drilling                carried out during DSDP-IPOD operations, have shown that the                    numerous atolls and adjoining presently submerged reef-capped                   seamounts are the result of Eocene and Cretaceous(?) to Recent                  reef growth on Eocene and Cretaceous(?) volcanic foundations that               were erupted atop the subsiding Pacific plate of Jurassic age.                  The morphology, internal facies geometry, and diagenetic history                of the limestone sections below the atolls and within the                       submerged reef-caps have been controlled be sea-level                           fluctuations induced by the waxing and waning of glaciers during                the Cenozoic era.  Studies to date indicate that the Marshall                   Islands region has subsided ~1500m since latest Cretaceous or                   Early Eocene time.  This anomalously fast rate of subsidence on a               lithospheric plate of Early(?) Jurassic age has been ascribed to                a mid-plate thermal rejuvenation and uplift of the plate.                               Research supported in this award has as its objectives the              bathymetric and seismic mapping and sampling of submerged, reef-                capped seamounts and guyouts in the Marshall Islands.  These                    studies will provide data with which to determine the subsidence                history of this anomalous region and to determine the facies                    geometry, diagenetic history, and timing of cessation of reef                   growth of the submerged seamounts and guyouts as these relate to                sea-level fluctuations.  The data will also be used in planning                 future drilling in this area.",
