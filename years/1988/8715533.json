 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are observational data that can be explained more easily if               there is non-luminous (dark) matter in galaxies.  The effects of                the dark matter can be studied by comparing the theoretical                     models with observations.  This research is to study the effects                of dark matter and the research plan is divided into four basic                 topics:                                                                                                                                                         - An observational study of NGC5666 - an elliptical galaxy with a                 disk of gas that provides a unique opportunity for the study                    of the mass distribution of an elliptical galaxy.                             - Observations of the rotation curves of dwarf galaxies.                        - A broad look at modeling dark halos of galaxies.  The results                   of careful fitting of existing data will be shown.  These                       techniques will be used to fit the new observational material.                  The need to include \"core pulling\" in detailed models will be                   shown.  While these phenomena have been generically described                   by a number of investigators, they have not yet been                            incorporated in model building.                                               - Simulations of the evolution of the expansion and recollapse of                 a protogalaxy.                                                                                                                                                The common theme that unites these projects is that they are all                aimed at determining the form and distribution of dark matter.                  The simulations are needed to relate these quantities to the                    properties of dark matter at the time of galaxy formation and at                still earlier times.                                                                                                                                            Finally the research will give results about galaxy halos:  Are                 they cold, warm or hot?  Are uniformities in properties due to                  nature or nurture?",
