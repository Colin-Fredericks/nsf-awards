 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the last twenty years, there has been a movement among                American trial judges to make the facilitation of pre-trial                     settlement part of their role.  Innovative judges are devising                  techniques and procedures designed to encourage litigants who                   file suits in their courts to settle before trial, and in the                   process they are subtly redefining what it means to be a judge.                 Although academics and the legal community were instrumental in                 developing and popularizing the theory of alternative dispute                   resolution, there has been mixed reaction regarding the                         enthusiasm with which judges have embraced the idea that they                   have a role in promoting settlement.  To date, there have been                  few scientific studies of civil settlement.  We know that                       settlement negotiations take place and usually succeed, but we                  know little about how or why they succeed.                                           This project will consider the implications of this movement               and in particular will study the judicial mediation of cases                    brought by individuals seeking remedies against institutions for                alleged violation of statutory, common-law, or constitutional                   rights.  The goals of the research are to describe the steps                    involved in judicial mediation, to map the types of arguments                   raised and pursued in this form of dispute resolution, and to                   analyze the transformation of contentions and positions that                    occurs in the process of reaching settlement in public-law cases.               Twenty-five cases will be intensively studied using observation,                recording of settlement-conference sessions, pre and post                       conference interviews with all participants in the settlement                   effort, and a set of follow-up interviews with public-interest                  lawyers designed to elucidate further the perspective of                        litigators on findings derived from the case material.                               Facilitation of settlement in civil litigation is an                       activity of American trial judges that is growing in                            significance.  This research will lay a foundation for the                      development of empirically-based theory about informal processes                for resolving disputes.  Not only will it offer a theory of the                 course of judicial mediation, but a very significant goal of the                research is to determine how disputes are resolved and rights                   fare in judge-hosted settlement discussions.",
