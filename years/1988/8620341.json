 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to purchase a versatile state-of-                  the-art photomicroscope unit for the communal use of twelve                     investigators in the Department of Molecular Biology.  The                      Department is new but has already obtained international                        prominence in the areas of x-ray crystallography NMR                            spectroscopy, computer graphics, and organic chemistry.   The                   photomicroscope is critical for the conduct of research on:  gap                junction communication, genetic analysis of chlamydomonas                       motility, regulation of expression of lens fibre junctions,                     genetic analysis of cell division in yeast, specific gene                       expression in mammalian hippocampus, expression of hemin p. 70 in               bone marrow cells and other tissues, survival of salmonella in                  macrophages, developmentally regulated expression of trypanosoma                cruizi surface proteins, color variation in serratia marescens,                 genetic control of morphogenesis in dictyostelium discoidium and                molecular studies of entamoeba histolytica, characterization of a               cytoskeletal protein in the m-line of muscle, and importance of                 fluorescence microscopy for antineoplastic selectivity                          amplification.  Additionally the photomicroscope will enable the                department to expand its activities into new areas such as                      fluorescence signals, low-light intensification or enhancement                  procedures, and time-lapse video analysis for embryonic                         development studies.",
