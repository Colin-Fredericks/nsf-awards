 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of the planned research projects is the integration            of process design and process control.  Specifically, the development           of economically viable approaches to be used at the design stage of a           process to analyze for controllability/operability problems.  The PI            plans to look at three areas:  (1) the effect of process structure on           process controllability/operability, (2) correlation of transient               performance with process parameters (available from steady state data)          and (3) the use of composition measurements to improve distillation             column control.                                                                                                                                                 Chemical plants can be viewed as being built up from a small number of          basic structures.  Irrespective of the type of unit or units involved,          this structure affects overall process performance.  A defining set of          basic structures might include series-parallel, recombining, and                recycle structures.  The latter are widely used in the chemical                 industry for economic reasons and can have a drastic effect on both             the open loop and the closed loop performance of a system.  The goal            of this research is to determine the effect that recycle processing             configurations have on process operability/controllability and to               correlate this effect with design parameters.  Two examples will be             used to illustrate the control problem caused by recycle structures:            evaporator configurations and recycle systems involving distillation            towers, heat exchangers, and industrial reactors.  Control system               performance will be related to key design variables such as                     throughput, holdup, heat integration, and recycle ratio of mass and/or          energy.                                                                                                                                                         The PI has developed a method using a dimensionless number called the           relative disturbance gain (RDG) which when used in conjunction with             the calculated relative gain (RGA) can be employed to assess a                  process' transient behavior based on steady state information.  In              essence what the RDG measures is whether the closure of other loops in          a multiloop system produces favorable or unfavorable interaction in             terms of transient performance of the loop under consideration.                 Ultimately the PI plans to relate correlating parameters to key design          variables and to integrate RGA, RDG and measured peak properties into           an expert system.",
