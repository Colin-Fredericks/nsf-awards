 "awd_abstract_narration": "Regioselectivity in organic reactions is an important goal for                  chemists.  In addition to increasing yields of desired products,                separation costs are minimized.  Enzymes are the most efficient                 regioselective catalysts, however, they are not hardy enough for                most industrial processes.  Zeolites, with their molecular-sized                channels and cavities, have many of the properties of enzymes.                  They are able to select specific molecules according to size,                   orient these molecules into a particular conformation and supply                reactive sites.                                                                                                                                                 The research plan for this proposal is to design and synthesize                 ZSM-5 zeolite crystals with internal catalytic interfaces                       separating areas of high and low Al concentration.  The research                work will also establish physical techniques, concentrating on                  NMR, to demonstrate the presence and evaluate the quality of                    these interfaces.",
