 "awd_abstract_narration": "This science teacher development project at North Carolina                      central University will provide middle school teachers with                     updated content concepts, materials and curriculum                              development.  Twenty-five middle school teachers (grades 5-8,                   earth science teachers) will be enrolled in a semester                          workshop held during the spring semester of the academic year                   1988-89.  The ten week program will include fourteen three                      hour evening sessions and four day long Saturday field trips.                   The workshop will review new concepts, effective ways of                        incorporating contemporary issues, the use of computer                          assisted instruction and the importance of field experiences                    in the curriculum.                                                                                                                                              Major areas of study will focus on four basic units:                            Introduction to Earth Systems, Atmospheric Systems,                             Geological System and Hydrological Systems.  A field trip is                    scheduled for each major unit.  The formal workshops will                       emphasize laboratory activities which illustrate the four                       basic units and can be used, with minimal modifications, in                     the classroom. During the follow-up phase participants will                     work under the direction of the workshop staff to implement                     the workshop materials into existing courses.  Upon                             successful completion of the project, teachers will be                          awarded six continuing education units or three hours of                        graduate credit.                                                                                                                                                This project is important to the Teacher Enhancement Program                    since it addresses an area which has been ignored in our                        middle school curriculum.  it also allows teachers the                          opportunity to assume ownership of the curricular materials                     use in their classrooms.",
