 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most transportation actions regarding disaster conditions cannot be             tested or evaluated in a laboratory or inferred from normal                     situations.  They have to be acquired through real-life experiences             which in the case of an earthquake is a rare occurrence.  The most              significant events in the transportation and transportation-related             field that followed the October 1, 1987 Whittier earthquake is the              organized evacuations of special facilities such as convalescent                homes, hospitals and public and high rise buildings.                                                                                                            The main focus of this study will be on analyzing and evaluating the            immediate and short-term actions of these evacuations and comparing             the results in terms of evacuation times, training needs,                       transportation requirements and operational problems.                                                                                                           Special emphasis will be placed on the evacuation of the health care            facilities such as the Long Beach naval Hospital.  In that regard, an           interactive computer program will be developed to simulate the                  evacuation of a health care facility under natural disasters.  The              data from the evacuation of the Naval Hospital will be used to test             and calibrate the model.  The model outputs will provide an evaluation          of the system performance under different evacuation conditions.  The           model is intended to be a                                                       decision support tool that can assist the facility manager to                   determine the best allocation of resources to efficiently execute               a quick and smooth evacuation.",
