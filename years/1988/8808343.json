The P.I. will visit Dr.                   Titus' laboratory to learn techniques for raising various life                  forms of aquatic plants and will gain experience from rearing                   propagules from Lake George.  Herbivore effects will be studied                 in aquaria and through field sampling, and survey work will be                  done to locate lakes in which future experiments can be done.                   Other planning work includes conducting pilot trials on spot                    herbicide use, gathering field data on plant emergence, and                     finding means to count individual (genetically identical) plants                in stands of clones.                                                                                                                                                 These ROW supported planning activities will prepare the                   P.I. for developing a competitive research project on macrophyte                ecology.  The research thrust will be on effects of reproductive                structure (e.g., rhizomes, turions) on plant success or on the                  effects of herbivores on aquatic plant community structure.  Both               areas are promising avenues for future proposals.",
