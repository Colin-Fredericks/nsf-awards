 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of U.S. researchers in a              seminar on the \"Mapping of Operator Algebras,\" organized jointly by             Professor Richard Kadison of the University of Pennsylvania and                 Professor Huzihiro Araki of Kyoto University, Japan.  United                    States, Japanese and invited third-country participants will meet               at the University of Pennsylvania during May 1988.  The seminar                 will be devoted to discussions of recent developments in the                    subject of mappings of operator algebras and to the applications                that have been and are being made of these developments to our                  understanding of non-commutative analysis and geometry.                                                                                                         The field of operator algebras is rapidly advancing, with                       scientists from both the United States and Japan at the forefront               of this research.  This seminar will provide a forum for the                    exchange of ideas, particularly in the application of operator                  algebras to other fields of science such as physics.",
