 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent experiences with funding and managing U.S. activities               in international assessments of science and mathematics                         achievement have demonstrated a number of problems such as high                 rates of non-response and uneven survey methodology.  As a                      result, the National Academy of Sciences has proposed the                       establishment of a U.S. Board on International Comparative                      Studies in Education.  The general purpose of this board would be               to oversee U.S. involvement in international comparisons of                     education, particularly in student achievement.  More specific                  purposes would be to (1) provide a forum for information and                    discussion; (2) endorse U.S. participation in international                     studies; (3) assist in planning the conduct and funding of                      studies; (4) establish standards regarding quality of study                     design, data collection and analysis procedures, and report                     preparation; and (5) assist in the dissemination of study                       findings.  The studies of special concern for the near future are               those conducted under the aegis of the International Association                for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA).",
