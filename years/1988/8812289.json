 "awd_abstract_narration": "The bithorax complex (BX-C) plays a key role in the                             determination and maintenance of segmental identity during                      development of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.  This                    large gene complex is well characterized genetically and is now                 slowly yielding to molecular analysis.  However, the                            means by which the genes of the BX-C are so precisley                           regulated are not understood, and characterization of the                       huge regulatory regions of the complex has just begun.  The work                described in this proposal contributes to the molecular analysis                of the abdominal region of the BX-C, addressing                                 specifically the question, what is the role of the infra-                       abdominal-5,7 (iab-5,7) region?  Does it serve as a large                       cis-regulatory region for the adjacent Abdominal-B gene?                        What is the function of the transcripts encoded within this                     region? Is the entire region essential for normal function?                     Four major projects are proposed: (1) Recovery of new                           mutations within the iab-5,7 region using mutagenic agents which                cause small deletions or insertions.  (2)                                       Characerization of Abdominal-B transcript distribution in                       mutants of the iab-5,7 region by Northern analysis and in                       situ hybridization to RNA in embryonic tissue sections.  (3)                    Analysis of transcripts encoded within the iab-5,7 region by                    Northern analysis and isolation and characterization of                         cDNAs. (4) Determination of the genomic sequence of the                         entire region.                                                                                                                                                  These studies will contribute to our understanding of some of                   the complex genetic functions and interactions that occur                       during the development of a higher eukaryote.",
