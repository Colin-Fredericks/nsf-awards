 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Snow Entomological Museum at the University of Kansas is               a valuable and important resource for the study of systematic                   entomology.  The collection is strong in almost all major groups                of insects, particularly North American representatives, and in                 some (e.g., bees, water bugs, leafhoppers and scorpion-flies) the               Museum's holdings are worldwide in scope and rank among the best                in the world.                                                                        Recently, there has been a great increase in concern for the               conservation of diverse forms of life and the loss of diversity                 through destruction of natural habitats, such as tropical rain                  forests.  Museums of natural history are the repositories of                    examples of animal and plant diversity.  And since tree-fourths                 of all known species of animals are insects, entomological                      museums are facing a growing number of requests to store                        specimens (samples of diversity) and to lend these to researchers               studying the systematics or classification of insects.                               This projects will help the Snow Entomological Museum to                   increase its usefulness to the scientific community.  Added                     technical assistance will speed the processing of loan requests.                Visiting specialists will be brought to the Museum to sort from                 unidentified materials those specimens useful to their own                      research or that of colleagues studying related groups of                       insects.  Equipment provided by the grant (e.g., insect drawers)                will greatly increase the Museum's ability to deal with space                   needs resulting from detailed identification of specimens.",
