 "awd_abstract_narration": "Even though seismic isolation is growing very rapidly, data on                  response of isolated structures to actual earthquakes is still                  lacking.  This research helps fill this void by using isolation                 systems in a full-size building and obtaining data on relative                  response between isolated and nonisolated structures.  This latter              benefit results from the unique design of the test facility, located            at Tohoku University near Sendai, Japan.  The test facility consists            of two identical full-size three-story buildings built side by side,            except that one structure is seismically isolated and the other is              not.  The facility is easily adapted to use a variety of isolation              systems.  Since Sendai is a very seismically active area, considerable          data can be obtained in a short period of time.                                                                                                                 This research program will use base isolation systems (at Sendai) for           which bearings have been extensively tested in the laboratory.  The             research project results provide sets of data of individual bearings            in an actual building.  The system response of the adjacent                     nonisolated structure provides data for comparative purposes.",
