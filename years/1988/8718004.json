 "awd_abstract_narration": "The exotic nitrogen-fixing tree Myrica faya invades young                       volcanic sites in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.  Growth of                    native plants in these sites is strongly limited by low nitrogen                availability, and it has been demonstrated that invasion by                     Myrica substantially alters both nitrogen inputs and nitrogen                   availability in areas where it is abundant.  It is believed that                this invasion will alter population dynamics, community                         structure, and ecosystem-level nutrient cycling in native                       ecosystems of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.  The reproductive                 biology of Myrica makes it a successful invader, and its unique                 (to that area) physiology changes system-level productivity and                 nutrient cycling.  Analyses of biological invasions such as this                one offer the opportunity to determine how individual species can               regulate ecosystem dynamics, and integrate the approaches of                    physiological, population, community, and ecosystem-level ecology               in an ecosystem study.                                                                                                                                          The research team for this project has an excellent track record                for collaborative work and productivity.  Facilities for the work               at both Stanford and the University of Hawaii are quite good in                 cooperation by the National Park Service and by NASA are first                  rate.",
