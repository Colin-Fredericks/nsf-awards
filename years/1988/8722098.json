 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Herbig will carry out observations which are designed to                    provide important new clues to the source of the diffuse                        interstellar bands which have been puzzling astronomers for many                years.  In an effort to correlate the strengths of the diffuse                  bands with local properties of the interstellar medium, Dr. Herbig              will carry out high precision observations of stars imbedded in                 ionized hydrogen clouds and of stars behind clouds in which the                 coatings of interstellar dust grains have been removed.  Dr.                    Herbig will also search for the signature of interstellar                       polyatomic carbon molecules which have been suggested as a carrier              of the diffuse bands.                                                                                                                                           A classical problem of stellar spectroscopy remains unsolved after              many years; the source of the diffuse interstellar bands is still               a mystery.  New instrumentation, such as charge coupled devices                 and reticon arrays, makes a renewed observational effort to solve               this problem worthwhile.  Dr. Herbig is in an excellent position                to provide new clues to the resolution of this puzzle.",
