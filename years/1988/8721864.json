 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to quantify and determine the                  stability of aluminum-organic complexes that can occur in water                 draining from forested drainage basins that are impacted by acid                deposition.  Water-soluble organic compounds derived from forest                canopy litter can play a critical role in the mobilization of                   aluminum in forest soils, but relatively little is known                        concerning their complexes with aluminum.  In this project, a                   systematic investigation of these complexes is being undertaken                 involving studies of the acid-base chemistry of water-soluble                   forest leaf litter; studies of aluminum complexes with leaf                     litter ligands using infrared, electron spin resonance, and                     fluorescence excitation spectroscopy; comparative, quantitative                 studies of aluminum-leaf litter complexes with compleximetric and               fluorimetric methods, and calculation of pH-independent stability               constants for aluminum-leaf litter ligand complexes.                                                                                                            The chemical speciation of aluminum in natural waters has emerged               as a problem of critical importance because of the effect that                  acidic deposition from atmospheric pollutants has on solution of                aluminum compounds in soil, and the impact of those compounds on                water quality.  This research may lead to insights into how water               may be decontaminated by proper engineering design and management               of drainage basins.",
