 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to characterize diverse                   iterative design processes qualitatively by means of a simple                   graphical construction.  This construction, sometimes referred                  to as the \"basins of attraction,\" is a graphical summary of how                 the design process proceeds from many different starting                        points, or initial designs.  Results of this research will                      provide a global view of iterative design processes - a window                  through which a wide range of behavior may be observed                          qualitatively.  It will reveal the existence of extreme                         sensitivity to initial conditions that can plague certain                       iterative processes.  It may prove to be a convenient graphical                 characterization of specific design phenomenon, such as fully-                  stressed vs. non-fully-stressed design, or Hardy Cross' hybrid                  action in design iteration.  Perhaps more importantly, it will                  provide a common denominator with which to compare and contrast                 very dissimilar design processes, revealing similarities                        between methods that are not normally considered to be closely                  related, or conversely, revealing substantial differences                       between similar processes, such as Newton and quasi-Newton                      methods.",
