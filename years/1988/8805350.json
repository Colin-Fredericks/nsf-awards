 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modelling of the South American upwelling coastal ecosystem must           consider the impact of ancient El Nino events (Middle and Early                 Holocene, Pleistocene, and Tertiary).  Such events may have varied in           average frequency of occurrence and/or strength, or may have been               absent altogether.  Documentation of ancient El Ninos is of paramount           significance because of the role such events may have played in (1)             the cultural development of Andean and coastal maritime civilizations,          (2) the biogeographic development of Quaternary littoral faunas, and            (3) the evolution of the pelagic ecosystem.  The published geological           support for ancient El Nino events fails to simultaneously satisfy two          requisite criteria:  (1) evidence of discrete El Nino-associated events         and (2) evidence of oceanic warming along the west coast of South               America.                                                                             It is proposed to satisfy both criteria by application of growth           increment and geochemical analyses to the extensive molluscan record of         coastal Peru.  The 1982-1983 El Nino event was encoded in morphologic,          isotopic, and trace elemental patterns of bivalve shell growth and we           will apply these techniques to the study of ancient mollusks obtained           form the following sources along the coast of Peru:  (1) post-Columbian         dump sites, (2) pre-Columbian shell middens, (3) transgressive shelf            shell lags, (4) raised marine terraces, and (5) marine sedimentary              rocks.  This will provide a temporal span from historical times back            to the Pliocene.",
