 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent work in this laboratory has shown that the common                   mineral goethite is an important new low temperature oxygen                     isotope geothermometer in combination with silica, carbonate or                 phosphate.  A potentially important development in these studies                has been the discovery of a CO2 component in natural goethites                  that might serve as a quantitative indicator of CO2 partial                     pressures.  The proposed studies include experiments to calibrate               the temperature dependence of the hematite-water oxygen isotope                 fractionation, substantiation of the goethite-water oxygen isotope              curve, and further investigation of the CO2 component in goethite               as a possible indicator of ancient P(CO2) values.  Additional                   efforts will include infrared work to study both the amounts and                chemical speciation of the CO2 in goethite.  This knowledge will                be applied to Phanerozoic oolitic hematitic and goethitic                       ironstones representing ore-grade concentrations of chemically                  precipitated, oxidized iron which formed during two extended                    \"pulses\" in the Phanerozoic.  These pulses generally coincided                  with periods of high eustatic sea level, flooded continents, and                rapid rates of sea-floor spreading.  The study should yield                     information on surface or near-surface temperatures, water-rock                 interactions and possibly CO2 partial pressures in the local                    environment.  More generally, such data could provide insight into              plaeoclimate and possible secular variations in seawater 0-18/0-16              ratios at a time when there was continental glaciation in the                   southern hemisphere, thus increasing our knowledge of conditions                during an interval of considerable interest in the Phanerozoic.",
