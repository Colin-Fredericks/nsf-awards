 "awd_abstract_narration": "Heat pipes are devices which transport heat with only a small thermal           resistance.  This characteristic is the result of phase change                  processes--evaporation and condensation--which occur at either end of           the pipe.  Critical issues in the efficient operation of a heat pipe            are the transport of vapor and liquid between the ends.                                                                                                         The proposal deals with three fundamental issues which affect the               operation of heat pipes:  (1) the distribution of noncondensable gases          and other gaseous or vapor species, (2) condensation of vapor in the            wick structure that is placed in the heat pipe to facilitate liquid             transfer, and (3) transient effects during start-up, shut-down, and             changes in heat load.  The proposed research consists of a succession           of modeling efforts, each structured to include previously unaccounted          phenomena.  To facilitate the inclusion of these effects, the integral          forms of the conservation equations will be used rather than the more           complex differential forms.  Experiments will be performed to support           and verify the analytical predictions.",
