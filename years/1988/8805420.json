 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will establish a Research Experience for                             Undergraduates Site at the State University of New York-Fredonia.               The project will foster the intellectual and emotional                          development of 10 undergraduate participants by involving them in               an investigation of plant-pollinator interactions.  The research                will focus on the role that amino acids play in attracting insect               pollinators to floral nectars.  Participants in this project will               collect nectars and quantify their sugar and amino acid                         compositions using High Performance Liquid Chromatography.  In                  addition, they will study the behavioral response of various                    pollinators to amino acids in the nectars of plants.                                                                                                            This project will be divided into two parts, summer (1988) and                  winter(1989).  The eight summer weeks will offer one week of                    introduction to theory and methods, three weeks of directed                     research on group projects, and four weeks of independent,                      participant-originated projects.  During the fall semester,                     participants will analyze the results of their individual                       projects.  They will return to Fredonia in January, 1989, when                  they will prepare oral presentations of their projects to be                    presented at the Eastern College Science Conference (ECSC) in                   April 1989.                                                                                                                                                     Student researchers in this project will develop through 1) an                  increased understanding of ecology, behavior, evolution,                        biochemistry, and chemical instrumentation 2) hands-on experience               with specific field and laboratory research techniques, 3)                      practice in critical reading and analytical thinking, and 4)                    acquisition of a variety of research support skills.  All of                    these accomplishments will enhance the emotional maturity of                    participants, help to define their career choice as scientists                  and, in some cases, raise their aspirations.",
