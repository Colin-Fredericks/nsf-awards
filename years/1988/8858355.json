 "awd_abstract_narration": "This recommended award provides research support to Dr. Brandeau under          the Foundation's Presidential Young Investigator Awards (PYIA)                  program.                                                                                                                                                        The research concerns the development and solution of mathematical              models of production systems, with focus on facility location,                  manufacturing, and health care delivery systems.  Specifically she is           developing analytical solutions for a variety of planar location                models, analytical worst case bounds for composite heuristics in job            shop scheduling, and a medical school financial planning model.  These          are all extensions from her previous research.                                                                                                                  Dr. Brandeau has made significant contributions to her field of                 engineering and has potential to become a leader in academic research           and education.                                                                                                                                                  The objectives of the Presidential Young Investigator Award program             are to provide research support to the nations most outstanding and             promising young science and engineering faculty.  The awards are                intended to improve the capability of U.S. academic institutions to             respond to the demand for highly qualified science and engineering              personnel for academic and industrial research and teaching.  In                accordance with these objectives, a Presidential Young Investigator             Award is recommended for Dr. Brandeau.                                                                                                                          This is a five year continuing grant, with expected future funding              levels of $62,500 for FY89, FY90, FY91, and FY92.",
