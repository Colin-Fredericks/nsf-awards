 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Sheng Hsien Lin of Arizona State                  University for several short term visits to collaborate with                    Prof. E. W. Schlag of the Technical University of Munich.  They are             studying the mechanisms of laser-stimulated desorption or                       vaporization of adsorbed molecules from solid surfaces, using both              infrared and ultraviolet-visible lasers.  They plan to continue                 their investigation of spectral shifts and electronic relaxation of             van der Waals complexes.  In addition, they will study the                      spectroscopic properties and dynamical processes of benzene and                 other dimers and the photoisomerization of an aromatic molecule                 embedded in a cluster as a function of cluster size.  They will also            carry out a theoretical study of photoionization threshold                      spectroscopy on van der Waals clusters to show that this leads to               more accurate determination of ionization potential and provides                information on the structure and vibrational frequencies of the                 cluster.                                                                                                                                                        Professor Lin is carrying out state of the art theoretical research             on problems of great current interest in chemistry - studies of                 laser-stimulated vaporization of molecules from surfaces and of the             spectral properties of van der Waals complexes.  Such work requires             input from experiments.  Collaboration with Dr. Schlag and his                  outstanding group of experimentalists provides this very necessary              interaction.  Their prior collaboration has produced a number of                significant contributions.  Current plans for further collaboration             promise valuable new insights into the processes that take place in             a molecule after it has absorbed energy from light.",
