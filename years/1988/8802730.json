 "awd_abstract_narration": "A joint U.S. - France workshop entitled \"Computer Algebra and                   Differential Equations\" will be held in Grenoble, France from May               24 to May 27, 1988.  The organizing committee consists of Jean                  Della Dora, Evelyne Tournier (both of the TIM3 Laboratory at                    Grenoble) and Michael F. Singer  (at North Carolina State                       University in Raleigh, N.C.).                                                                                                                                   In recent years, there have been several advances in the theory of              formal solutions of differential equations.  These have included                deeper understanding of power series, asymptotic and closed form                solutions of differential equations and difference equations.  At               the same time, computer algebra systems have become more and more               sophisticated and offer the opportunity to automate these ideas.                The present workshop is planned to allow workers in computer                    algebra to learn of the theoretical developments and at the same                time make the researchers in theoretical areas aware of questions               arising in the design of computer algebra systems.  Professors B.               Malgrange, J.P. Ramis and M.F. Singer will deliver a series of                  expository lectures on various aspects of formal solutions of                   differential equations and there will also be a few additional                  short talks.  Time will be allowed for the participants to study                the material presented as well as hold informal discussions.                    Attendance will be limited to about 50 people; 25 from France and               25 from the United States.  By limiting the attendance the                      organizers hope to enhance the conditions leading to a fruitful                 exchange of ideas.  Academic Press has agreed to publish the                    proceedings of this conference.",
