 "awd_abstract_narration": "Temperature is one of the greatest limiting factors to                  successful aquaculture ventures in temperature climates.  Because               of this many US companies, that developed important shrimp                      culture technologies, have moved to more tropical climates to                   start shrimp farms, and sell the shrimp to the US.  This project                proposes to develop an aquaculture system to culture shrimp in                  temperate areas.  A greenhouse will be built over a portion of                  the shrimp ponds and initially used as an enclosed nursery within               the pond.  As the shrimp grow and the weather becomes warmer,                   additional sections of the pond will received water warmed by the               greenhouse. In this way, it will be possible to start growing                   shrimp earlier in the year.  If successful, this approach will                  add about 45 days to the growing season, and will produce a                     larger marketable shrimp and improve the economic viability of                  the culture operation.",
