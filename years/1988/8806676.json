Raymond Bauer and Joel Martin have organized a                        symposium on the reproductive biology of the Crustacea, scheduled               for the December 1988 meeting of the American Society of                        Zoologists (ASZ).  The three major themes of the symposium are                  1) the chemical, visual, and acoustic mechanisms used by                        crustaceans for attracting mates, 2) courting and mating                        behavior, and 3) the morphological variation and functional                     considerations of mating structures.  Research on these phenomena               has accelerated in the past decade, and the proposed symposium                  will be the first attempt to integrate them.  A synthesis of                    these areas would illuminate the evolutionary role of mate                      selection, reproductive structures and mating behavior.  The                    symposium is being cosponsored by the Invertebrate Zoology                      Division of the ASZ and by the Crustacean Society.  The day-long                symposium will include 12 invited speakers and several sessions                 of contributed technical presentations.  The organizers plan to                 publish a proceedings volume of corresponding manuscripts.                           The proposed symposium and proceedings volume have important               potential impact on a number of areas.  Researchers on other                    arthropod groups, such as the insects, will gain insight into the               larger questions of evolution of reproductive systems.                          Ecologists will gain valuable new data on population and                        reproductive biology of a diversity of crustaceans, which are                   commonly used environmental indicators.  Most of all, the                       symposium will set in motion a generation of highly integrative                 research on evolution, reproductive biology, and mating behavior.",
