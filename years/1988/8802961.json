 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Puerto Rico proposes the establishment of a Center            for Tropical and Carribean Research.  Researchers at the Center will            study the following areas:  Tropical Marine Natural Products, Tropical          Terrestrial ecology, Geology in the Caribbean, and Natural Hazards              Mitigation.  The tropical marine ecosystems of the shallow and deep             water of Puerto Rico are noted for their wide environmental and biotic          diversity.  Similarly, Puerto Rico, along with Hawaii, has the only             other tropical rain forest in the United States.  Puerto Rico is also           located within a seismically active plate boundary.  All of the                 factors provide a logical rationale for Puerto Rico's multidisplinary           approach to research.  The Center will be used to motivate minority             students at all educational levels to consider careers in science and           engineering.  In addition, the Center will develop strategies to                strengthen partnerships with industry and other major research                  institutions.                                                                                                                                                   This project meets the major goal of the Minority Research Centers of           Excellence (MRCE) program:  to increase the minority presence in                science and engineering by making substantial resources available to            upgrade the research capabilities of the most productive minority               institutions.  The project will at the same time enable this                    institution to use research as a tool to increase the effectiveness of          related science and engineering activities for minority groups in its           region.  The Center will accomplish this by providing opportunities             for faculty and students at the University of Puerto Rico and other             nearby institutions with sizable minority student enrollments to                engage in meritorious research that leads to publications in refereed           journals.",
