 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the research is to establish basic design                 principles to achieve robust communication over channels                        corrupted by thermal noise and by unknown interfering signals of                bounded power, using pseudo-random communication systems.  This                 work will complement and extend current research on communication               using error-control coding, interleaving and spread-spectrum                    modulation.  Such systems are special cases of those considered                 in this research project.                                                            Two general issues are addressed.  The first aims at                       establishing the potential coding gain offered by pseudo-random                 communication systems.  This question will be addressed in the                  context of code-division multiple-access and interference                       suppression (anti-jamming) applications.  A key aspect of this                  problem is to quantify the role of interleaving in robust                       systems.                                                                             In the second part of this research, the principal                         investigator will introduce and examine the structure and                       performance of a new class of robust coding systems, called                     pseudo-random codes, which generalize coding systems with                       interleaving and spread-spectrum modulation.  As in spread-                     spectrum these codes are driven by pseudo-random parameters;                    however, coding, interleaving and spectral spreading are                        performed simultaneously.  Theoretical results show that within                 this family of codes are some that, in some situations, achieve                 coding gains much greater than those that can be achieved with                  spread-spectrum techniques for the same expended power, bandwidth               and complexity.//",
