 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem of communicating research results and other technical               information to the lay public is often overlooked, yet it                       represents a widespread and chronic problem.  This information                  transfer dilemma is even more pronounced in cross-cultural                      situations where language compatibility and cultural relevancy                  are added to the barriers of technical jargon and accessibility.                Such is the case with research in the Arctic.  The objective of                 the proposed pilot project is to test a means of communicating                  research activities to arctic Native resident peoples in order to               ascertain whether or not, and in what ways, their understanding                 of the value of such activities may be enhanced.  Experience                    leads to the current conclusion that a combination of video                     programming and graphic display posters would best accomplish                   this end, thus, a short VHS-format videotape would be produced                  explaining, in lay terminology, the activities and relevance of                 research at the Toolik Lake Field Station on Alaska's north                     slope.  The video, along with graphic poster displays, would be                 shown in four arctic villages and the response of viewers                       evaluated.  Positive results could lead to the use of this                      approach for regular communication of research activities to                    local residents throughout the Arctic.  This proposal responds to               the intent of the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984 to                     involve residents in all aspects of research.",
