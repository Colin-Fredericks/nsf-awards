 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two reacting solid-state systems are investigated using dynamicx-ray            diffraction (DXRD) and other techniques.  The systems to be studied             are (1) the reaction of calcium oxide and silica to form calcium                silicates, and (2) the synthesis of mullite from colloidal boehmite             and silica.  The objectives of the study are (1) to obtain                      quantitative verification of       DXRD-acquired data in a system of            known kinetic behavior (calcium silicate),  (2) to apply DXRD to a              multiply reacting system (mullite), (3) to determine the effects of             particle size and water vapor on the roles of diffusion and kinetics            in solid-solid reactions, and (4) to determine the reaction sequence            and rate-limiting steps in the production of sol-gel-derived mullite.                                                                                           This project includes the first application of DXRD to a system with            unknown kinetics.  This new technique, developed by the investigator,           has the potential to provide more detailed information on solid-solid           reacting systems than has been possible up to now.",
