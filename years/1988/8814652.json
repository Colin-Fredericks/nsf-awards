 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two examples of material from chemically zoned magma chambers                   are the Bishop Tuff in California and the Lower Bandelier                       Tuff in New Mexico. In the Bishop Tuff, the eruption appears                    to have overturned the contents of the magma chamber,                           preserving a stratigraphic record of the chemistry of the                       chamber.  The eruption of the Lower Bandelier Tuff did not                      preserve the chemical layering which has been deduced to have                   been present in the chamber.   The difference between the two                   eruptions suggests that the Bishop Tuff chamber had a density                   (volatile) gradient while the Lower Bandelier magma chamber                     was more homogenous with respect to volatiles.  This project                    will quantify the volatile content in the two chambers by                       analyzing trapped melt inclusions in phenocrysts which                          represent different stratigraphic horizons.  Ion and electron                   microprobe techniques will be used to determine the content                     of H, F, Cl and S in the melt inclusions as a fuction of                        depth in the original magma chamber, thereby determining the                    magnitude of the volatile gradient.  Electron probe analyses                    for major elements will help determine the unaltered nature                     of melt inclusions and ion probe microanalyses of selected                      lithophile trace elements will help determine the original                      stratigraphic position of each phenocryst.                                      The PI will do the ion microprobe work.  He is collaborating with               Dr. P. Kyle of of the New Mexico Institute of Mining and                        Technology, who will do the rest.                                                ***",
