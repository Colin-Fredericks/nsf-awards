 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acid rain and acid deposition have become major scientific                 and political concerns.  Rain has a natural acidity due to                      dissolved carbon dioxide.  Although the acidity of rain can be                  made even greater by the emission of certain gases from human                   endeavors, other natural sources may contribute as well.  Among                 these natural sources is vegetation which is presumably a source                of natural organic acids such as acetic and formic acids.  An                   understanding of the role of organic acids, their origin, and                   the influence of ecosystems in their origin is relevant to a                    more complete understanding of processes leading to the                         formation of acid rain.                                                              A primary goal of this project is to establish                             concentration ranges of formic and acetic acid in rainwater from                two distinct but nearby coastal North Carolina environments, a                  salt marsh and a forest, to evaluate whether an ecosystem can                   influence the composition of the precipitation that it receives.                Rainwater will be collected on an storm event basis during                      growing and non-growing seasons.  The rainwater samples will be                 analyzed by ion chromatography for chloride, sulfate, nitrate,                  ammonium, formic acid, and formic acid. The acidity (pH) of the                 rainwater will be measured as well. A secondary goal is to                      determine the effect of sampling procedure on the measured                      concentrations of formic and acetic acids.",
