 "awd_abstract_narration": "The decrease in stratospheric ozone over Antarctica during the Austral          spring has prompted concern over potential biological effects of an             enhanced solar ultraviolet radiation flux.  Although few life forms             inhabit the Antarctic continent itself, the potential impacts on oceanic        and coastal organisms are issues which merit further study.                     Furthermore, the situation provides an opportunity to test models of            atmospheric transmittance of ultraviolet radiation as a function of             ozone concentration.  Frederick proposes to define the climatology of           ultraviolet radiation over Antarctica and the nearby ocean.                     Measurements of ultraviolet radiation will be taken before, during, and         after the period of springtime ozone depletion, using scanning                  spectroradiometers located at three Antarctic stations (South Pole,             Palmer, and McMurdo).  Frederick has developed a two-stream radiative           transfer model which includes absorption by ozone, multiple Rayleigh            scattering, reflection from a lower boundary, and scattering by clouds.         Ultraviolet radiation climatology will be developed for the entire              Antarctic region over the sunlit portion of an entire year using ground-        based data at the available sites, satellite measurements of ozone over         the continent, and a set of radiative transfer calculations based on            Frederick's model.  In addition, data will be used to evaluate the              health and biological consequences of the ambient levels of ultraviolet         radiation.",
