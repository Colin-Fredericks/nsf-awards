 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a program of research exchanges by leading                  mathematicians from the U.S. and Italy, under the direction of Prof.            Louis Nirenberg of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences and           Prof. Umberto Mosco of the University of Rome.  The aim is to continue          excellent scientific contacts already established and to broaden them           with short research visits, primarily to centers in Rome, Pisa,                 Florence, Pavia, Milan, Trento, Bologna and Trieste.  These research            visits will focus on the theory and application of nonlinear                    differential equations with particular emphasis on:  1) fully                   nonlinear second order elliptic partial differential equations;                 2) the use of capacitory methods in the study of regularity and                 variational stability in elliptic equations and variational                     inequalities; 3) periodic solutions of Hamiltonian systems and of               other problems involving nonlinear vibrations; and 4) the further               development of techniques from nonlinear functional analysis, calculus          of variations and algebraic topology to attack nonlinear problems.                                                                                              This award adds an international component to currently supported work          of Prof. Nirenberg.  The quality of the participants is very high and           the topics are at the forefront of nonlinear analysis.  Furthermore,            many of the topics arise from applications to mathematical physics,             nerve conduction problems, elasticity, fluid dynamics, and                      consequently have deep and substantive connections to other scientific          fields.",
