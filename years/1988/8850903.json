 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests a portion of the costs for a series of seminars          and workshops that will bring together funders and operators of teacher         networks, policy makers from state and local levels, leaders of                 significant educational reform projects, academics and researchers, and         representatives of major professional educational organizations and             associations.  These planning conferences will be devoted to issues of          policy and technical issues of the funder-project relationship.  The            policy seminars will include issues of \"school restructuring\", the              teaching profession, and future funding areas.  The technical issues            seminars will include the delivery of technical assistance to funded            programs, assessment issues across projects, and ideas for sustaining           teacher networks.                                                                                                                                               The NSF portion of the entire effort will be less than one fourth of the        actual costs and will be approximately equal to the Carnegie Foundation         and the Ford Foundation share.",
