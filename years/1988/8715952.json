 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adiabatic shear banding is the name given to a localization                     phenomenon that occurs during high-rate plastic deformation, such as            machining, shock impact loading, ballistic penetration, and metal               forming processes.  As shear bands are believed to be precursors to             material fracture, a knowledge of these phenomena, and of factors               that inhibit or enhance their initiation and growth, is essential to            the production of durable materials.                                            The study will concentrate on:  a) developing efficient algorithms to           integrate the governing field equations, b) identifying the most                appropriate constitutive model for the study of such problems, c)               studying the effect of different ways of modeling a material                    inhomogeneity, d) identifying material parameters that affect                   significantly the initiation and subsequent development of shear                bands, e) studying the effect of the loading path on the initiation             and growth of a shear band, f) investigating the interaction among              two or more bands, and g) assessing the damage caused by a shear band           to the material.",
