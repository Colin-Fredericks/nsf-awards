 "awd_abstract_narration": "The oxidation of water to molecular oxygen is a                                 characteristic reaction associated with photosynthesis in                       higher plants.  Light quanta producing excitation of the                        photosystem result in the transfer of electrons one at a time                   until four electrons are removed from two water molecules to                    produce oxygen.  The chemical intermediates involved in                         transferring electrons at high reduction potentials and in                      storing the oxiding equivalents needed to yield oxygen are being                                                                                                investigated.  Manganese is involved in the water-splitting                     enzyme, and X-ray spectroscopy at the Stanford                                  Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory is being used to determine                     the oxidation state, ligation and local structure around the                    Mn.  Together with studies using EPR spectroscopy, results                      have verified the direct participation of Mn oxidation state                    changes in the water-splitting process.  This proposal aims                     to characterize the nature of the manganese binding site,                       first by identifying the proteins involved and then in                          determining the specific amino acids involved in providing                      ligands to the manganese., In the near future it is hoped to                    characterize the molecular species involved, through the use                                                                                                    of electron-nuclear and electron-electron double resonance,                                                                                                     and X-ray spectroscopy as well the nature of the way in which                                                                                                   water becomes incorporated into the water-splitting enzyme                                                                                                      prior to the final formation and release of oxygen.  Knowledge of                                                                                               this process will be most useful in developing artificial                                                                                                       systems whereby solar energy can be used to convert water                                                                                                       into molecular oxygen and hydrogen fuel.***",
