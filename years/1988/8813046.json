 "awd_abstract_narration": "The northern Bering and southern Chukchi Seas are characterized by high         primary and secondary productivity.  Recent research in U.S. waters             indicates that food supply, sediment heterogeneity and silt/clay                content, and water temperature are major factors influencing benthic            processes.  Past research by Soviet scientists indicates that biomass is        also high in Soviet waters, although few studies have addressed the             processes influencing the high-biomass populations.  During a joint             US/USSR cruise, Grebmeier will test the hypothesis that direct pelagic-         benthic coupling on the shallow continental shelf of the northern Bering        and southern Chukchi Seas enhances benthic production and carbon cycling        in the underlying benthos.  For comparison, stations in Soviet waters           will be sampled in a manner similar to those previously sampled in U.S.         waters.  Results will greatly enhance the understanding of carbon and           nitrogen cycling within the Bering and Chukchi Seas.  This Research             Planning Grant was awarded through the Research Opportunities for Women         Program.",
