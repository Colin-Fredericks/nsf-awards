 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this decade, research has revealed rudimentary but intriguing                similarities between certain aspects of human language and the                  vocal communication of monkeys living in social groups.  There                  are parallels in categorical perception of primate calls and                    speech, in some of the functions of calls and words, and even in                the neural structures involved in the control and production of                 speech and monkey calls.  Several recent studies have suggested                 that there may be developmental affinities as well.  For example,               infants and juveniles apparently require experience for both                    production and proper contextual usage of calls that effectively                represent objects or events in their external environments.                                                                                                     Complexity in the vocal communication of macaque monkeys is the                 theme of research by Drs. Harold and Sarah Gouzoules.  In                       previous work on two species of macaques, the Gouzouleses found                 that acoustically distinct types of recruitment screams are                     associated with specific features of the situation (e.g., the                   relative dominance rank of an opponent and the severity of the                  attack) and appear to provide allies with information pertinent                 to decisions about intervention tactics.                                                                                                                        The Gouzouleses now are investigating the acquisition of                        communicative competence by young macaques and the question of                  species differences in the acoustic features of calls used in                   similar contexts.  Vocalizations and concomitant behavioral data                will be collected on three groups of monkeys (representing three                macaque species) maintained in large outdoor enclosures at the                  Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center of Emory University.  The               Gouzouleses' novel approach to the analysis of the developmental                modification of vocal behavior employs a multivariate statistical               technique (discriminant analysis) and a battery of two dozen                    acoustic measurements to assess differences between adults,                     juveniles, and infants.",
