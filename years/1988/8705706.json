 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Chang Dae Han,                       Department of Chemical Engineering, Polytechnic University, to                  pursue with Dr. Sung Chul Kim, Korea Advanced Institute of Science              and Technology, for a period of 24 months, a program of cooperative             research on fundamental aspects of the polyurethane-unsaturated                 polyester interpenetrating network.  Specifically, the                          collaborators will develop (1) kinetic models for describing the                curing reactions of polyurethane-unsaturated polyester blends, (2)              chemorheological models for describing the variation of the                     viscosity of these blends during curing, and (3) a mathematical                 model for simulating the pultrusion process of such blends.  By                 establishing a firm basis for understanding the curing reactions of             polyurethane-unsaturated polyester blends and determining the                   optimal processing conditions for yielding desired end-use                      properties, the researchers seek to be able to develop new resins               or modify existing resins for specific applications and to better               control processing operations.                                                                                                                                  Although the proposed cooperative project is basic research on an               important polymer blend system, its successful completion could                 have important implications for the development of new products                 tailored for specific applications.  The two collaborators are                  highly respected scientists who have long been engaged in parallel              studies on polymer systems.  The present project will permit them               to combine their complimentary talents and experience in important              and interesting research.  This project is relevant to the                      objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which                  seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean              scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific                     information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through                          collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  The research will add             an international cooperative dimension to ongoing research at                   Polytechnic University supported by the National Science Foundation             under Grant No. MSM8744680.",
