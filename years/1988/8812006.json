 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transportation costs account for 15% of the U.S. Gross National                 Product.  A major element of transportation involves the management,            routing and scheduling of vehicle fleets such as the routing of school          buses and the dispatching of trucks delivering consumer goods,                  supplying fast food restaurants or just in time delivery to industrial          manufacturers.  Progress on optimizing the utilization of truck fleet           operations can have very significant economic payoffs.  Further                 progress, however, depends on the development of new powerful                   combinatorial optimization algorithms.  This award will support                 research to develop and validate such algorithms for several vehicle            routing problems.  The research draws on recent methodological advances         in Langragian relaxation, optimization of travelling salesman problems          and polynomical algorithms for certain graph problems.  The resulting           models will be tested and validated on very large truck fleet                   operations of several major corporations.",
