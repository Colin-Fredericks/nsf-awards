 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most                       powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                   the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                     substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                  molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                    molecules in solutions.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                         spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out                      frontier research.                                                                                                                                              This award, supported by the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation                   Program, the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program and                 the Interfacial, Transport, & Thermodynamic Processes Program                   will help the Department of Chemistry at Clark University to                    acquire a wide bore NMR spectrometer.  The proposed instrument                  will serve not only the Department but will be shared by a                      number of scientists in the region through the aegis of the                     Worcester Consortium.   The areas of research in the Worcester                  Consortium that will be enhanced by the acquisition include:                                                                                                    1) Dynamics and Structure in Polymeric Systems                                  2) NMR Studies of G Protein-Ligand Interactions                                 3) Effect of Immobolization of the Inherent Selectivity of                         Spectrophotometric and Spectrofluorometric Reagents                          4) Study of the Intracrystalline Diffusion in Molecular Sieve                      Zeolites by NMR and Gravimetric Methods                                      5) NMR Studies on Antibody Binding Sites",
