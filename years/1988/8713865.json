 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a grant for research into ways that allow reliable and                  efficient control of large parallel systems containing thousands or             millions of component computers.  Candidate algorithms will be analysed         with a combination of the two techniques: direct simulation of as many          as two thousand computer nodes to explore major factors in algorithm            performance and mathematical analysis to give precise formulae for              scaling results onto even larger systems.                                                                                                                       Expected benefits from this research include:                                                                                                                   (1) creation of distributed tree algorithms to control global resources         in large systems;                                                                                                                                               (2) creation and evaluation of partially distributed algorithms                 tailored for efficient execution on large parallel processing systems           by locally using shared cluster memory and very globally using slower           communications to exchange data;                                                                                                                                (3) comparison of major algorithms for performing key tasks in large            parallel systems, for example, to determine at what systems size                asynchronous gossip techniques for keeping distributed copies of system         databses weakly consistent become more efficient than synchronous               mehtods of assuring mutual consistency of all copies before any changes         are made; and                                                                                                                                                   (4) generally establishing and confirming design techniques for                 operating systems for large parallel computers, especially as they              differ from the control techniques needed for small systems.",
