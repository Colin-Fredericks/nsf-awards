 "awd_abstract_narration": "Concurrent systems with dynamic interprocess topology present a new             control problem in computer programming.  Currently programmers are             forced to describe topologies at a level analogous to that of the               pointer or the goto statement.  The investigator proposes the use of a          technology based on graph grammars to control interconnections in a             high-level, abstract manner.                                                                                                                                    The computational agents in our system communicate through sets of              ports.  Each port is connected to a set of other agents.  A graph               grammar is used to specify the class of legal topologies, which may be          altered by rewriting using a production in the grammar.  This may               change the connectivity of agents.  A high-level selection mechanism is         employed to enable an agent to select subsets of agents connected to            particular ports for communication.  Agents consist of a set of                 methods; when a message is received the appropriate method for                  processing that message is invoked.                                                                                                                             The research under this grant involves the investigation of language            features and programming environment support necessary for a graph-             grammar based approach to concurrent programming, the implementation of         the system both on shared-memory and message-passing architectures, and         the investigation of algorithms for the mapping of logical graph                topologies onto physical processor topologies.",
