 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Lu at Western Connecticut State University will determine the               gravitational potential force of our Galaxy as a function of                    height from the galactic plane.  The most important and unique                  aspect of this study is that it will produce data on a set of                   uniformly selected faint F type stars which are centered at both                the North and South Galactic Poles.  These data are required for                an investigation of the velocity distribution of the stars, for                 evidence of a thick disk for the Galaxy, and for the dynamical                  study of missing mass of the Galaxy.                                                                                                                            Determination of the gravitational force law as a function of                   height from the Galactic plane is of fundamental importance to                  understanding the structure of our Galaxy.  Much more                           observational work is needed to better define the force law and                 its consequences for the densities of the thin disk, the thick                  disk, and the halo populations of stars in the Galaxy.  A number                of efforts are underway, but the results are, as yet,                           inconclusive.  Since an optimum observational method is not                     clear, it is important to address the problem through                           observations using several different types of stellar samples.                  Dr. Lu's research concentrates on a sample of F type stars while                other astronomers are focussing on other types of stars.",
