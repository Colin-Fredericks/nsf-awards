 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed studies are aimed at studying the relative roles              of loading with accompanying elastic pore pressure increase and                 pore pressure diffusion in triggering seismicity at Monticello                  Reservoir, S.C. following its impoundment.  Monticello is unique                in that extensive geological, geophysical, and seismological                    studies were conducted prior to, during, and after filling, making              this one of the best studied cases of reservoir induced seismicity              in the world.                                                                                                                                                        Determination of the relative roles of loading and pore                    pressure diffusion requires analyses of accurate spatial and                    temporal patterns of well located earthquakes together with the                 induced stresses and pore pressure changes which occurred during                filling.  As the geology at the site is extremely heterogeneous,                development of a three dimensional velocity model is necessary to               obtain accurate hypocentral locations.  We propose to develop such              a model by inversion of high quality local earthquake phase data                within constraints imposed by detailed geological and geophysical               data.  Relocation of initial seismicity using the improved                      velocity model will provide an accurate spatial and temporal                    history of the activity.  From a comparison of these patterns with              that of the load induced stresses it will be possible to                        differentiate the relative roles of loading and pore pressure                   diffusion in triggering the seismicity at Monticello Reservoir.                 The results of these studies will be directly applicable to the                 control of RIS associated with reservoirs worldwide.",
