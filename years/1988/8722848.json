 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer networks have become very common.  It is very important to             develop methods which allow computers to efficiently communicate with           each other.  One low cast scheme is to have a single shared                     communication medium, called a multiple access channel, such that every         computer can receive all messages sent over the channel.  This scheme           is currently used by Ethernet and other networks.  If two or more               messages are sent simultaneously, they will interfere with each other,          and no useful information will be transmitted.  Efficient use of the            communication channel requires a coordination scheme which allows one           computer at a time to transmit.  The main goal of our research project          is to develop improved probabilisitic and deterministic algorithms              which coordinate the computers' access to the channel so that the               percentage of time in which useful information is transmitted is                maximized.  In addition, we plan to show that the algorithms employed           are nearly optimal, which will demonstrate the maximum possible                 effectiveness of multiple access channels.  We will also develop                algorithms for multiple access channels which give computers on the             network more information.  Our results on the performance of this more          powerful channel will indicate the effectiveness of improved channel            technology.",
