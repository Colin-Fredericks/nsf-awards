 "awd_abstract_narration": "The basic theme of this proposal is the study of control laws in the            presence of many controllers, each one of which has his own objective,          the decisions of each one influence the information and objectives of           the others, and where each controller has noisy measurements and not            necessarily the same with those of the others.  The overall system              evolves in discrete time.  Such problems belong to the area of Dynamic          Stochastic Game Theory.  Two types of models are considered.  In the            first, the evolution is described by linear discrete time stochastic            difference equations with linear noisy measurements and quadratic               costs.  In the second, the evolution is described by a finite                   dimensions Markov chain in discrete time with average expected value            costs.  Control laws which solve these game problems and have                   desirable characteristics are sought.  Such a study, besides its own            theoretical interest, could be useful in several engineering economic           or military applications.",
