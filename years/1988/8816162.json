 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) requires a service to store,              publicize, and fulfill requests for NSF-owned visual materials                  regarding antarctic subjects.  The collection, presently housed at              room 627, National Science Foundation, 1800 G Street, N.W.,                     Washington, D.C. 20550, consists of approximately 12,000 mounted 35mm           slides, 6,300 black-and-white negatives with contact proofs, and                approximately 25 videotapes comprising raw footage and finished films.          These materials are used to respond to requests from the media,                 public, NSF staff, and other Federal agencies.                                                                                                                  The contractor will fulfill requests in a timely and efficient way,             maintain caption and credit information about the slides and black-             and-white photographs (including those in negative form), catalog               caption and credit information, and number slides, photographs, and             black-and-white negatives.  This information will be provided to NSF.                                                                                           Fulfillment of requests includes performing research to identify items          that satisfy the needs of the requester, providing duplicates or                prints, lending original materials to responsible organizations                 (limited to established media such as newspapers and magazines) or to           others with NSF's permission, and providing users with captions and             credit information.  The contractor will monitor use of the collection          and will dun users of originals when necessary to assure return of              materials to the collection.  It also will perform research and                 fulfillment (including duplication of slides and printing of black-             and-white photographs from the original negatives) for NSF when                 requested.                                                                                                                                                      The contractor will store all materials in a way that assures long-             term preservation, easy retrieval and replacement, convenient addition          of new items to the collection, and security from loss, theft, or               physical damage.  It also will publicize the collection among likely            users such as media, educational institutions, and science                      organizations.  NSF will be consulted in advance of all publicity               actions.                                                                                                                                                        I recommend that Capital Systems Group be awarded $67,428 for the               first year of work.",
