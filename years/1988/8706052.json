 "awd_abstract_narration": "Remarkable progress has been made in the application of the                     scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) to the                         quantitative analysis of the mass distribution within individual                biological molecules.  The STEM has been used to measure the                    molecular weights of a number of proteins, fragments of proteins,               and nucleoprotein complexes.  This project will bring STEM-like                 capabilities to conventional microscopes, especially those                      capable of electron imaging spectroscopy (EIS), such as the Zeiss               EM902.  Image acquisition, display, and analysis programs will be               developed using an existing Silicon Graphics IRIS and                           commercially available inexpensive C subroutines that are                       portable to Masscomp, Silicon GRaphics, and IBM PC AT computers.                The software will allow the low-loss electrons to be used to                    determine absolute mass, mass/length, and mass distributions of                 isolated biological molecules in the dehydrated or frozen-                      hydrated states.  In addition, multiple high-loss energy filtered               images will be used to map the distribution of major elements in                the samples.  The programs will be used to further characterize                 the structure of chromosome fibers.  Other users will also have                 access to our developments.  The developmental work and the                     biological problem on which it will be carried out are of far-                  reaching importance.  It is likely that a significant fraction of               NSF-funded biological research will benefit from the availability               of these quantitative techniques.",
