 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term objective is to develop integrated software                  systems for automation of design, engineering, and manufacturing                tasks--a technology that is needed for the computer integrated                  factory of the future.  This requires the development of product                databases that contain the totality of information related to all               aspects of the product.  The proposed Expert Solid Modeling Shell               will provide a high level environment for developing and documenting            such a database.  The shell concept and object-centered programming             technique are borrowed from expert system technology to provide a               system that can be customized to user needs.  This will allow                   designers to define properties of features they wish to work with,              to instantiate these from a library and to manipulate them as                   desired.  \"Intelligence\" will be imparted by three sets of rules:               Cognition, Inheritance, and Interpretation.  Cognition rules will be            used for detecting invalid operations; Inheritance rules for                    deriving feature parameter values from parents: Interpretation rules            for decoding information required by an interface while building its            own multi-layered database incorporating feature relationships and              descriptions.  Feature taxonomy codes will be used by a post-                   processing program to convert design features to manufacturing                  features so that product data can be used to drive automated process            planning, group technology classification and manufacturability                 evaluation programs, etc.",
