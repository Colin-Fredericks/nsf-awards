 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is to support a \"Capitol Area Theory Seminar, 1988-1989\"           which will provide funds for senior researchers in computer science             theory to visit the area and interact with the community of younger             computer science theory researchers there.  Twelve speakers in diverse          fields of theoretical computer science will be invited to speak at an           area-wide seminar, and interact with the theoretical computer science           researchers in the area.                                                        There is a set of gifted young computer science theoreticians in the            capitol area and a lack of senior researchers to act as guides or               mentors.  This point makes the area unique compared to other areas              where there are concentrations of computer science theory researchers.          Thus the proposer saw a strong need for senior personnel to visit the           area to \"be in residence\" for the benefit of the younger researchers.           This argument was strongly supported by the reviewers.  Professor               Cherniavsky is well-qualified to organize the seminar series as he is           well known and respected in the computer science theory community.",
