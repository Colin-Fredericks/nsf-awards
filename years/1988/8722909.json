 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable collaborative research between Dr. Romeo                 Flores of the U.S. Geological Survey, Denver and Mr. Simon Nathan               of the New Zealand Geological Survey.  They will collect and                    describe stratigraphic and sedimentologic data from the Buller                  Coalfield in the northwest South Island, New Zealand.  The                      investigations will emphasize study of the facies of the coals and              associated sedimentary rocks with the intent of constructing a                  depositional model.  This model will then be used to evaluate the               stratigraphic architecture and areal distribution, as well as the               thickness, lateral variation, geometry, and quality of the coal                 deposits.                                                                                                                                                       Construction of depositional models of ancient coal measures is                 useful in predicting stratigraphic architecture, lateral and                    vertical distribution, thickness, geometry and quality of                       associated coal deposits.  Because the physical and chemical                    properties of coal are directly related to environmental settings,              such predictive models can serve as guides to exploration and                   development of economic coals.  Simon Nathan's working knowledge of             the Buller Coalfield will be complemented by Romeo Flores'                      expertise in developing coal basin facies models.  Knowledge gained             in this project, in addition to directly impacting methods of                   exploration and mining of coal deposits in New Zealand, will add to             our general understanding of the nature of world coal resources and             their distribution and origin.",
