 "awd_abstract_narration": "The synthesis of new polymeric materials is proposed, using                     olefin matathesis and olefin metathesis polymerization catalysis.               This work is intended to demonstrate whether these reactions are                versatile routes to a range of molecular topologies and are                     useful in polymer interface applications.  Block copolymers will                be prepared by the metathesis of vinyl-terminated polymers, the                 use of polymeric chain-transfer agents and the sequential                       addition of two specific monomers to a metathesis polymerization.               Graft copolymers will be synthesized by the cometathesis of                     cyclic olefins and cyclic olefin-terminated polymers                            (macromonomers).  Macrocyclic polymers will be prepared by                      metathesis of divinyl-terminated polymers using a heterogeneous                 catalyst.  Single polymer and copolymer networks will be prepared               by metathesis of dicyclic-olefin-terminated polymers and                        cometathesis of cyclic olefins and a crosslinking agent.  The                   development of a versatile crosslinking agent is an objective of                this work as well.  Star polymers will be prepared by cyclic                    oligomerization of cyclic olefin-terminated polymers.  Gradient                 modulus materials will be prepared by varying the crosslink                     density across one dimension of macroscopic poly(alkenamer)                     objects.  Catalytic adhesion processes for polymers will be                     developed using both poly(alkenamers) and cyclic olefin-                        surface-modified vinyl polymers, metals and metal oxides.  Thin                 film coatings of poly(alkenamers) will be constructed by surface                graft metathesis from modified metal, metal oxide, and vinyl                    polymer surfaces.                                                                                                                                               This research uses innovative  methods to produce a variety of                  new materials, including some that have new types of structure on               the surfaces of polymers.  The properties of these new materials                should be of considerable interest.",
