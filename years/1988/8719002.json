 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vacuum electron devices, instead of solid-state devices, provide                potentially the best engineering solutions for many microwave system            functions involving high power, high efficiency and certain kinds of            harsh environments.  The current effort to expand the state-of-art of           high power microwave electron devices has intensified the need to               understanding the highly nonlinear and dispersive nature of the                 interaction between electrons and rf fields.  The current research              will investigate the situation where the self-contraction of a slow-            circuit-wave in an electron cloud results in the formation of electric          field solitons and convective electron vortices in the electron-rf              interaction space of a microwave crossed-field amplifier (CFA).  The            experiments include (1) simulation of a simple CFA device using a pure          electron plasma and standard plasma diagnostics; and (2) development            of advanced diagnostic techniques to search for the existence of                solitons in a commercial 425 MHz CFA.  The proposed work can establish          the much needed physical basis for the application of a soliton based           theory to understand highly nonlinear effects in high power microwave           devices.  The proposed work is also very fundamental in nature and may          foster the transfer of several well-established plasma concepts to the          study of microwave electron devices.",
