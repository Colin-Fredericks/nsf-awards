The symposium deals with neuromodulators and scientists from                    around the U.S. and two from other countries will come together                 to discuss important aspects of this topic.                                                                                                                     The following issues will be addressed:                                                                                                                              1.  What is a neuromodulator?                                                                                                                                   2.  Do modulators have distinctive chemical properties                                                                                                          3.  Is there a hierachichal functional organization                                 among the various classes of neuromodulators?                                                                                                               4.  Do particular modulators subserve similar                                       behavioral functions over great, or only over                                   short, taxonomic distance?                                                                                                                                  5.  Are the lessons from neuromodulators in the                                     behavior of invertebrates applicable to                                         vertebrates?  to mammals?                                                                                                                                   6.  Are there behavioral consequences in the co                                     localization and release of modulators and                                      transmitters by single neurons?                                                                                                                             7.  Are certain classes of modulators associated with                               specific mechanisms (e.g., certain ion channels or                              intracellular messengers)?                                                                                                                                  8.  Are all behaviors equally capable of modulation?                                                                                                            The Integrative Neural Systems Program is pleased to aid in                the support of this symposium.",
