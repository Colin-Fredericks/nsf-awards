Dr. Songer's planning          project develops a design for the construction of a multi-user data             base on cases considered by the U.S. Courts of Appeal.  The purpose of          the planning grant is to assess the scientific potential of a multi-use         data base on the courts of appeal, identify the scope and parameters of         such a data resource, and develop a working model for the systematic,           reliable, and standardized collection of data.  In order to ensure that         the data base project is designed to maximize the utility for potential         users, Dr. Songer's project includes active work with an advisory               committee to secure input from a broad range of public law scholars on          issues of the theoretical utility of the data set, its methodological           significance, its appropriateness in terms of current and anticipated           future scholarly interests, the costs and benefits of standardization,          the gains to be made from investing in the inclusion of unpublished             opinions, data definition, and reliability.  It is hoped that this              planning grant will permit the development of a data set that will              contain measures of theoretical and practical significance comparable           to those being developed for other data sets on the Supreme Court and           the district courts.",
