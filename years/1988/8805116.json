 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            designed to increase the participation of minorities in scientific and          engineering research by providing support to strengthen the research            environment and capabilities of predominantly minority institutions.            Institutions eligible to participate in this program must have in               addition to a substantial enrollment of minority students, graduate             programs in science or program in engineering.                                                                                                                  The City College of the CUNY system will use RIMI support to establish          a molecular genetics program in yeast.  The long-range goal of this             project is to understand the control mechanisms of normal DNA function          and maintenance and examine strains which develop increased                     sensitivity bleomycin may also exhibit increased sensitivity to                 radiation.  Preliminary evidence suggest that these radiation                   sensitive strains have been altered in their ability to repair DNA              damaged by radiation.  Bleomycin sensitivity therefore marks certain            genes (BLM) which in some way control DNA functions.  The proposed              research will test this hypothesis by first mapping and cloning the             BLM genes.  The isolated genes will then be characterized by                    determining their nucleotide structure, how the genes are expressed in          the cell and the nature of the gene products.  If these objectives are          achieved, the results will contribute to our understanding of DNA               repair.                                                                                                                                                         This research will add to and complement existing educational and               scientific programs in modern molecular biology at City College.  The           principal investigator is a young talented minority woman scientist             who has prior research experience in yeast genetics and physiology and          has published frequently in refereed journals.  The Foundation                  supports this project because it will allow a well-trained scientist            the opportunity to continue a promising career in molecular biology             and in general expand opportunities for minorities to participate in            meritorious research.",
