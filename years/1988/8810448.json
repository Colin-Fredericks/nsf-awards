 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interleukin 1 (IL-1) is a major immunoregulatory molecule                       in mammals, and it has a critical role in defense mechanisms                    against a variety of environmental insults.  \"Tumor necrosis                    factor\" (TNF) is another macrophage-derived cytokine whose                      activities are very similar to those of IL-1.  The great                        importance of these proteins in self defense suggests that they                 may have been conserved through evolution.  Results from this                   laboratory suggest that IL-1 is found in the echinoderms and                    protochordates.  The major goals of the proposed research are to                define the amino acid sequence and corresponding DNA sequence for               invertebrate IL-1,  to trace the emergence of the cells                         responsible for its production and release, and to characterize                 the functions of this mediators in the invertebrates.  The                      invertebrate homolog of TNF will also be sought and studied in                  parallel with IL-1.                                                                                                                                             The discovery of a homolog of the immunoregulatory molecule, IL-                1, in the starfish strongly suggests that chemical signaling                    molecules are important in defense mechanisms of organisms at all               levels of complexity.  This research will provide new information               on the mechanisms of self defense in invertebrates.  In addition                to its intrinsic interest, however, information on the function                 of this immunoregulatory molecule in invertebrates may provide                  new insights into the mechanism of its multiple actions in higher               animals.",
