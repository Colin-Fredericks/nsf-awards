 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between                          Professor Gabriel Weinreich of the University of                                Michigan, Ann Arbor, and Dr. Rene Causse of the                                 Institut de Recherche et Coordination                                           Acoustique/Musique (IRCAM), Paris, in the field of                              computer studies of the dynamics of musical                                     instruments and of the synthesis and reproduction of                            sound.  This work extends previous collaborative                                efforts of these researchers in the synthesis of                                musical instrument sounds based on physical models of                           the instrument's functioning.  The research will                                include the development of acoustic array audio                                 radiators with the capability of simulating the                                 radiation patterns of real sources, and the use of an                           acoustic holography system for acquiring data on the                            radiation patterns to be simulated.                                                                                                                             The U.S. researcher will benefit from having access to                          the spherical acoustic holography system at IRCAM,                              both to verify the performance of the acoustic array                            to be developed, and to collect data on musical                                 instruments to be simulated.  The French researchers                            benefit from the basic physics experience of the U.S.                           collaborator.  This work may contribute to the                                  understanding of basic acoustics, as well as the                                development of improved loudspeaker systems.",
