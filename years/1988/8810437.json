 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern signal processing algorithms and their corresponding                     matrix-based operations are computationally demanding and require               implementation into application-specific VLSI chips and systems.                Since circuits for executing modern signal processing are large                 and complex, it is necessary to have state-of-the-art tools to                  design the chips and systems.  Understanding the nature of such                 tools is an important research issue today.  The principal                      investigator is investigating the structure of an advanced                      silicon compiler dedicated to the design of digital signal                      processing circuits.                                                                                                                                            He intends to analyze and evaluate different number formats and                 their finite word-length effects on important signal processing                 algorithms, and to evaluate architectural tradeoffs needed for                  efficient VLSI realization.  Results are being incorproated into                high-level computer-aided-design optimization programs.  He is                  also integrating the system tradeoffs with lower-level silicon                  assembler tools through an appropriate electronic design                        database.",
