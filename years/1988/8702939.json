 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses several related issues in the static                analysis and optimization of logic programming languages.  First,               semantic issues underlying the optimization of such languages are being         studied.  This work includes the investigation of different notions of          equivalence between logic programs for program optimization purposes,           and the development of pragma languages to express such information.            Second, a uniform framework for the dataflow analysis of logic programs         is being developed.  We expect this work to both improve our                    understanding of problems underlying the analysis of logic programming          languages, and lead to the development of more efficient and flexible           analysis methods for such languages.  Finally, high-level optimizing            transformations of logic programs are being studied.  The focus here is         on the interaction of such transformations both with the appropriate            notion of program equivalence, and with operational properties of               programs.",
