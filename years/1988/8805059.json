 "awd_abstract_narration": "This year-long program will measure soil gas Rn and Hg at sites                 over the active silicic Rabaul Caldera in Papua New Guinea, in                  order to test a model developed at Long Valley, California and                  the Phlegrean Fields, Italy.  Rabaul has erupted catastrophically               several times in the last 3,500 years, and seismic evidence                     strongly suggested a major eruption in 1983.  This did not take                 place but the potential is still there and the volcano remains a                serious threat.  Preliminary data, collected by the PIs just                    before the crisis of 1983, indicated that substantial anomalous                 concentrations of both gases were related to the center of uplift               and caldera boundary faults.  Detectors will be placed over the                 margins of the caldera, as well as under water in Rabaul harbor                 (inside the caldera).  These should provide baseline measurements               necessary to establish the usefulness of Rn and Hg emissions as                 eruption precursers.  The local volcano observatory personnel are               also very interested in them as an additional tool to be used in                their efforts to monitor this specific volcano.",
