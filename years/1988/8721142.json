 "awd_abstract_narration": "The introduction of the concept of a paleomagnetic Euler pole              (PEP) to the analysis of the apparent polar (APW) path for North                America has resulted in significant differences from most previous              and widely used empirical APW paths, particularly in the Late                   Triassic and Early Jurassic.  Because of the fundamental role of                APW paths in geodynamic interpretations, these differences have                 important implications regarding plate kinematics, terrane                      displacements and paleogeography.  There are however critical                   uncertainties in judging the reliability of the relatively few                  Late Triassic and Early Jurassic paleopoles that are available.                 New, well-dated reference paleopoles are therefor needed for this               time interval to resolve these ambiguities and to test the                      potentially powerful PEP model.  This project was a detailed                    paleomagnetic study of the Newark Supergroup.  These rocks are                  exposed in some 20 basins along eastern North America and                       represent a virtually complete and well-dated stratigraphic                     succession from at least the middle Carnian (earliest Late                      Triassic) to the Trocian (late Early Jurassic), the same time                   interval when current APW paths for the Mesozoic differ the most.               Our objective is to obtain a detailed, well-constrained sequence                of paleopoles  supported by fold and other field test as well as                rockmagnetic data, over the stratigraphic range by fold and other               field tests as well as rockmagnetic data, over the stratigraphic                range represented by the Newark Supergroup.  Preliminary                        paleomagnetic studies on representative sample collections from                 the Newark, Hartford, Wadesboro and Fundy basins demonstrated the               feasibility of this objective.  The pattern of paleopole migration              derived from this study should allow a convincing test of PEP                   models of APW and in any case contribute to the refinement of a                 problematical segment of the APW path for North America.",
