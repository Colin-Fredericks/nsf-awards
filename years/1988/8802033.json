 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theory of growth analysis will be extended to show                     growth rate distributions which produce stem curvature and                      torsion.  The use of anatomical records for determination of                    growth rate distributions will be tested.  To obtain insight into               the biophysics of growth, spatial distribution of the growth rate               will be compared to patterns of rheological properties, measured                with the pressure probe, and to patterns of microtubule                         organization, visualized with indirect immunofluorescent                        microscopy.  The results will enhance our understanding of the                  processes controlling growth and morphogenesis of cells and                     organs, and the adaptation of plants to stressful environments.                 This understanding is prerequisite to the development of rational               and process based genetic manipulation of plants to improve their               performance.                                                                    %%%                                                                                  The form of a plant is the result of growth of its component               cells, and this growth is known to involve yielding of the cell                 walls in response to an internal pressure.  The rigid cell wall                 of plants requires different mechanisms for reacting to growth                  than the more flexible animal cell. The magnitude and direction                 of the wall yielding process produce the change in form as the                  plant develops. Dr. Silk proposes to continue her research on the               kinematics (spatial and temporal patterns of growth rate) and                   dynamics (relationships among force, energy and growth rate)                    involved in plant growth. She approaches these studies with both                theoretical, mathematical modeling and direct experimental                      measurements of the mechanical forces involved.",
