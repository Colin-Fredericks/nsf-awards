 "awd_abstract_narration": "McNeese State University will offer a two-year summer Young Scholars            Program in the field of engineering for 20 academically high achieving          black students who have completed the 8th or 9th grade.  The program            will have three main components:  \"hands-on\" engineering; counseling;           and class work in geometry, trigonometry, and computer aided design.            This commuter program will be held for eight weeks during the summer in         the College of Engineering and Technology.  During the \"hands-on\"               portion, students will build a 24-foot diameter geodesic dome.                                                                                                  Classroom work will be directly related to the two \"hands-on\" projects.         Most of the instruction will be computer directed, using teaching               software for mathematics and the AutoCad program for drawing designs.           Students will be drawn from those who completed a Pre-Freshman                  Engineering Program (PREP) sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy           at McNeese State during the summer of 1987.  The Young Scholars Program         will function as a follow-up for the PREP program.",
