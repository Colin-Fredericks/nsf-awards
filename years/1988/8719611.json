 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine the molecular structure and the                       regulation of synthesis of the neuropeptide, eclosion hormone                   (EH), in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta.  EH is synthesized                both in the brain and in the ventral CNS and released before each               molt to elicit a preprogrammed pattern of neural activity                       culminating in ecdysis.  The 62 amino acid peptide has recently                 been sequenced and we intend to isolate the EH gene using                       synthetic oligonucleotide probes designed based on the protein                  sequence.  The isolation of the EH gene will offer the                          opportunity to study the synthesis and action of a neuropeptide                 in the relatively simple nervous system of an insect with it's                  identifiable neurons.                                                                                                                                           We will examine the structure of the EH gene by a combination of                nucleic acid sequencing and transcript mapping studies and will                 identify other potential peptides derived from the prohormone.                  We will determine the developmental regulation of EH mRNA                       synthesis and will analyze the endocrine factors that regulate                  its expression.                                                                                                                                                 The cellular localization of the EH transcript will be determined               by in situ hybridization both in the brain and in the cells                     associated with the ventral CNS, the two sources of EH.  Finally,               the presence of EH-like sequences in other insects will be                      examined by hybridization to the EH gene.",
