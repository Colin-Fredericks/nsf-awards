 "awd_abstract_narration": "Georgia State University (GSU) and the Georgia Institute of                     Technology (GIT) will operate an Undergraduate Faculty                          Enhancement project in chemistry for Georgia and surrounding                    Southeastern U.S. states.  The project will improve the ability                 of faculty at two- and four-year, public and private,                           institutions to teach a modern program in chemistry.                                                                                                            The major activities of the project are 15 one-week workshops and               six 2-day mini-symposia.  Workshop topics are:  (1) molecular                   modeling; (2) mass spectrometry; (3) microcomputer-instrument                   interfacing; (4) FT NMR; (5) chromatography; (6) application of                 molecular orbital theory to organic and inorganic chemistry.                    Mini-symposia are mini-courses in: (1) organometallic chemistry                 and homogeneous catalysis; (2) solid state chemistry and                        superconductivity; (3) DNA chemistry and its application to                     biotechnology.  The workshops and mini-symposia will be taught by               GSU and GIT faculty.  Additionally, prominent specialists from                  other institutions will serve as keynote speakers.  Annual                      reunions of all participants during the preceding 12 months will                also be held to exchange experiences in implementing new methods                in the curriculum. Over a 3 year period 1710 participant days are               scheduled.  A compilation of all innovations in the coursework at               undergraduate colleges resulting from the project will be sent to               all project participants. In addition to NSF grant, participants'               institutions will contribute about 5% in travel funds toward the                operation of the project.",
