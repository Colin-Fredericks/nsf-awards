 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to increase our understanding of           the factors that influence climate in urban areas, particularly those           involved in energy exchanges between the \"canyons\" formed by tall               buildings on the one hand, and the atmospheric layers that overlay the          \"canopy\" formed by clusters of adjacent tall buildings on the other.            Professor Arnfield will measure energy flows within selected urban              canyons and at their tops.  A numerical model will then be used to              simulate the energy budget of such canyons and to relate them to                atmospheric features overlying building canopies and to other aspects           of urban climates.  This research is important to understanding the             relationship between the microclimates of urban canyons and the                 broader climatology of cities.",
