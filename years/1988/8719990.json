The symposium has been                     organized with three underlying principles in mind:  1)  that                   its program reflect the diversity of approaches recently taken                  by scholars who have written about various aspects of the                       era's mathematical culture;  2) that certain topics                             characteristic of the period be emphasized so as to give the                    program thematic unity; and 3) that particular emphasis be                      placed on issues pertaining to the tension between pure and                     applied mathematics, and to matters that shed some light on                     the relationships between mathematics and other scientific                      disciplines.  With these principles in mind, the symposium                      will address the following themes in eight separate sessions:                   1) Mathematical Institutions in France and Germany and their                    Role in Promoting Applications;  2) Relationships between                       Mathematics and Physics;  3) Foundations of Mathematics;  4)                    Complex Variable Theory;  5) Geometry in the Spirit of Klein's                  Erlangen Program;  7) Algebra and Number Theory;  and 8)                        Formative Influences on Mathematics in the United States.",
