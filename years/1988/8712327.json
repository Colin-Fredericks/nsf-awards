 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal provides for U.S. cognizance of European                     academic networking plans and activities, and for support of                    the U.S. segment of a joint United States - French network                      development project which will, when complete, facilitate                       interworking between U.S. and European academic and research-                   support computer networks.                                                           By taking out liaison membership in RARE (Reseaux                          Associes pour la Recherche Europeanne) the Principal                            Investigator will be eligible to attend (without voting                         status) both technical and policy meetings of RARE; by both                     speaking and listening he will be able to apprise RARE                          members of US networking requirements, to influence RARE                        recommendations, and to learn at the earliest stage of RARE                     activities that may affect US networks.  RARE, representing                     high-end users, and ECMA (the European Computer Manufacturers                   Association) are the two most influential Pan-European bodies                   influencing computer networking standards and their                             harmonization.                                                                       The project also provides for US expenses in joint                         United States-French development of a gateway that will                         translate between the US and European versions of the                           International Standards Organization (ISO) computer                             networking protocols; without such a gateway, US and European                   networks will not interoperate even though both \"conform to                     the ISO protocols\".  Infrastructure funded by the project                       includes the US share of a 56 kilobit satellite link between                    the US and France; the link will allow United States and                        French participants to collaborate in the gateway                               development, serve as a testbed for the gateway                                 itself, and in addition carry selected routine operational                      traffic between the US and the RARE community.",
