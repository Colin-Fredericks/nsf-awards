The effects of alkali and alkaline earth cations exchanged                      into the zeolite, the type of support (zeolite L versus                         alumina), and platinum particle size on the catalytic                           activity and electronic properties of the platinum are                          studied.  The catalysts are tested for heptane                                  dehydrocyclization, toluene dehydrogenation, and neopentane                     hydrogenolysis.  The electronic properties of platinum are                      characterized by infrared spectroscopy  of adsorbed carbon                      monoxide and by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.                                                                                                               Platinum deposited on barium-potassium zeolite L is an active                   and selective catalyst for the octane enhancement of unleaded                   gasoline. Related systems have demonstrated metal-support                       interaction that influence performance.  This study                             investigates such effects in a series of catalysts used in                      production of gasoline and should lead to improved                              performance and/or better control in the catalytic processes.",
