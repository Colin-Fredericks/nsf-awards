 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will be supported by the Organic and                              Macromolecular Chemistry Program.  The research will develop                    the chemistry of a class of sulfur containing molecules as a                    new synthetic pathway to the synthesis of molecules containing                  polycyclic systems.  The development of these reactions will                    result in new methods for the preparation of the complex                        materials needed in medicine and agriculture.                                                                                                                   The chief objective of the research on the chemistry of                         unsaturated sulfones is to open up new synthetic methods for                    the preparation of unusual polycyclic ring systems.  It is                      envisioned adding a variety of functionalized nucleophiles to                   phenylsulfonylallene followed by a subsequent base induced                      cyclization so as to prepare novel ring systems which could be                  of considerable use in organic synthesis.  Substituted                          thiophenyl allyl sulfones undergo a 1,3-allylic sulfonyl shift                  and this process will be utilized within a                                      metallation-alkylation sequence to prepare a variety of                         sulfonyl functionalized substrates.  Other studies will deal                    with the recently uncovered \u01313+2!-anionic cyclization of                        phenylsulfonyl-allene with methyl vinyl ketone.  Since the                      \u01313+2!-anionic cycloaddition strategy has not been investigated                  for the general synthesis of cyclopentenes, the cyclization                     reaction with a number of activated allenes and alkenes will be                 studied.  Plans also include a study of the chemistry of                        diazafulvene, which it is believed can be generated as a                        transient species from the cycloadduct derived from                             diazomethane and phenylsulfonylallene.  Another objective of                    the investigation will be to develop the chemistry of sulfonyl                  substituted cyclopropenes as reagents for the synthesis of some                 novel polycyclic ring systems.",
