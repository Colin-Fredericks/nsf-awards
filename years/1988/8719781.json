The objective of this research is to test the                              ability of a competing technique--an                                            interferometer--to measure winds in the atmosphere.                             An interferometer, suitably configured, will be                                 located adjacent to an existing 50 MHz device near                              Plattville, Colorado. Both devices will sense                                   common volumes of the atmosphere in both                                        troposphere and stratosphere, thus providing a new                              and unique basis for determining the suitability of                             this technique as a remote sensing device for air                               motions.                                                                             Dr. Adams, the Principal Investigator, is well                             qualified to perform these experiments; he                                      constructed a similar device (2.66Mhz) for                                      measuring mesospheric winds.                                                         I recommend support as a two year continuing                               grant at the requested budget level.",
