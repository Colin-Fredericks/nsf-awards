 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a three year project to provide 540 teachers and 180                    administrators with educational experiences and guidance on how to              improve the programs at their schools in the areas of  critical thinking        and mathematical problem solving. Each year there is an initial training        session offered to the participants and this is followed throughout the         year with teams of teachers, administrators, and the project staff              working together to become more knowledgeable in and devise methods to          enrich the problem solving aspects of the programs at the target                schools.                                                                                                                                                        The Corridor Partnership has effectively brought together members of the        local business community, scientists from the regional research                 laboratories and professional organizations, and professional educators         at all levels to provide support and guidance to this project as well as        to past efforts of the Partnership. Among these efforts, for example,           are programs that were conducted during the fall and winter of 1986             which serve as pilot projects for the proposed efforts.",
