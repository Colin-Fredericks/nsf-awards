 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a continuation of ongoing research into the possibility                 of automatically generating user interfaces for interactive                     computer systems.  The approach taken is to specify an interface                formally as a relation between a source object (such as some                    information in an application program) and a view object (such as               a graphical image on the computer's screen).  This relation is                  implemented as a \"filter\"--a  program which can satisfy some con-               straint on the two objects it relates.  Filters are                             bidirectional:  if the source changes, the view must be updated;                if the view is edited, the system must find a corresponding                     change to the source to keep the constraint satisfied.  In                      previous work the investigators developed a formal theory of                    filters and a language for defining user interfaces in such                     terms.  They now seek to refine and extend their ideas and test                 them in a variety of applications.                                                                                                                              Success in this project would lead to faster and easier                         construction of computer systems which are precisely tailored to                specific needs and yet uniform in the way they interact with a                  user.  The  learning and use of ever more powerful and complex                  systems would  be facilitated.",
