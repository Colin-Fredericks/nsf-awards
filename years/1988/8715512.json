 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a renewal project in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry           Program.  Dr. Swenton is studying electrode reactions as a means of             producing new synthetic reactions for the synthesis of complex natural          products.  The use of electrochemical reactions can make the synthesis          more efficient and potentially less polluting because greater control           can be exercised over the reagents.                                                                                                                             This program is comprised of two major areas of research.  One part             concerns the anodic oxidation of anilide derivatives and the chemistry          of the products formed in these reactions.  Preliminary work has                established that high yields of 1,4-addition products are formed from           anodic oxidation of two p-methoxyanilide derivatives.  Anodic oxidation         of p-methoxyanilides in methanol in the presence of lutidine serves as          a general route to quinone imide ketals.  These moieties undergo 1,2-           addition of organolithium reagents and 1,4-addition of malonate anion           in high yields.  The work involves an in-depth study of the anodic              oxidation of anilides. The chemistry of the products from these anodic          oxidations will be investigated.  These reactions not only serve as             versatile methods for obtaining uniquely functionalized anilides but            also will provide new approaches to ring systems present in many                natural products.                                                                                                                                               The second area of major emphasis focuses on methods for carbon-carbon          bond formation from transient intermediates generated from anodic               oxidation.  Studies on the anodic oxidation of 2'-substituted-4-                hydroxybiphenyls have established the important variables in the                intramolecular reactions of olefinic centers with intermediates                 generated from oxidation of the aromatic moiety.  A study of this               reaction with other olefinic units and other solvent nucleophile                combinations will be performed.  A route to dienones of the type                generated in these model studies would offer interesting approaches to          a variety of naturally occurring dienones (e.g., Pronuciferine) and             products biosynthetically derived from 2,5-cyclohexadienones.  Finally,         an interesting thermal route to 2,5-cyclohexadienones will be studied,          making use of recently developed quinol ether anodic oxidation                  procedure. Since 2,5-cyclohexadienone intermediates formed via phenolic         coupling reactions are the biosynthetic precursors of a wide range of           natural products, a direct, mild, and efficient method for conversion           of p-substituted phenols to dienones would complement existing                  synthetic approaches to these versatile intermediates.",
