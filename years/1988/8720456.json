 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasingly in the 20th century, science has assumed the role of               a kind of great legitimator.  Advertisers note that a panel of                  scientists (or doctors) recommend product x.  Science is used to                determine acceptable levels of toxins, minimal levels of                        nutrients, safety standards in buildings to cite just a few                     examples.  This use of science assumes that a uniform agreement                 among scientists exists.  Yet scientists are frequently not                     univocal in their positions,  and to assume that it must be is a                grave misunderstanding of the scientific process.  One need look                only at the current controversy among scientists on the                         feasibility of SDI to see how science may lead to fiercely held,                yet differing public policy decisions.  Such disagreement among                 scientists led to the termination of the science advisory                       apparatus during the Nixon administration because of                            disagreements over the SST supersonic transport.  It is important               to examine the role of science as a legitimator in our culture                  and to see how interested parties use science to attack and to                  defend against charges.  Dr. Apple is examining just this                       question in the context of promotion of vitamins, one of the most               heavily advertized products in our contemporary world.                                                                                                          From the earliest years of vitamin research in the 1910's, these                mysterious and elusive food elements captured the attention of                  the public and spurred the development of the vitamin industry.                 In 1933, the total retail value of vitamins sold in drug stores                 amounted to about $500,000; by 1937, this figure had grown to                   $41,800,000.  Sales of nutritional supplements could exceed $10-                billion by 1990.  A part of this growth has included nutrition                  quackery.  Enthusiasts who embraced and at times even created                   their own vitamins flourished.  Through their promotions,                       nutrition faddists and frauds helped popularize the discoveries                 of scientific research, affecting the public's perceptions of                   good nutrition while creating a demand for their products.  Dr.                 Apple will use data on such products and an estimate of the level               of popular knowledge about vitamin research drawn from                          contemporary publications.  This information will be integrated                 with information from the Federal Trade Commission and archival                 material from the Food and Drug Administration and the American                 Medical Association.  This study of the claims and products of                  vitamin research and vitamin quackery will document the use of                  science in the marketplace and help to clarify the complex and                  shifting relationships between science and commerce in a rapidly                changing society.",
