 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to continue the development of                         solids state NMR as a tool for characterization of bacterial                    peptidoglycan, specifically the peptidoglycan of B. subtilis.                   Both whole cells and cell walls of bacteria grown in defined                    media containing 13C and 15N -labeled amino acids will be                       examined by solids state NMR for the identification and                         quantitative analysis of cell wall substructures.  Gas                          chromatograph-mass spectroscopy techniques will be developed                    to complement the NMR data and will allow complete analyses                     in the presence of label scrambling.                                                                                                                            The bacterial cell wall is vital for the existence of these                     organisms in the environment and its metabolism represents a                    major focus for attack by antibiotics.  Recent NMR                              experiments aimed at developing a new analytical technique                      for determination of cell-wall cross-linking were carried out                   on the bacterium A. viridans.  This bacterium transports both                   labeled alanine and lysine readily and incorporates them into                   the cell wall with no scrambling.  NMR can then be used to                      measure directly the cross-link density in the bacterial cell                   wall.  An important step in the development of solids state                     NMR as a tool for the characterization of peptidoglycan                         substructures in bacterial cell walls is an extension of the                    technique to bacteria which are more commonly studied, e.g.                     B.
