 "awd_abstract_narration": "How organizations respond to legal change and shape the                    meaning of such change is crucial to understanding social and                   economic life in complex, modern societies.  Despite the                        importance of this issue, much of contemporary scientific                       research focuses on individual behavior and the individual as the               unit of analysis even when institutional context is being                       considered.  Only recently are scholars turning their attention                 to examining  organizations in relation to their social,                        political, and legal environments and the functioning of                        organizations as entities of social control and social                          regulation.                                                                          Dr. Edelman's study of institutional responses to civil                    rights laws offers an innovative approach to illuminating the                   role of organizations as a mediating instrument between law and                 its implementation.  Dr. Edelman examines the establishment of                  Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action offices in                  organizations, along with their consequences for the handling of                grievances and the diffusion of norms, as an institutionalization               process.  The design of the research calls for six detailed case                studies and nationwide telephone/mail surveys to key informants                 in 300 companies (200 proprietary firms, 50 federal agencies, and               50 colleges and universities), stratified by size, age, and                     industry.  The analysis includes use of event history methods to                model rates of adoption of EEO structures and grievance                         procedures.  Dr. Edelman seeks to explain such issues as                        variation in the autonomy of such structures in organizations,                  whether internal dispute resolution procedures divert complaints                from the courts, and the extent to which such procedures lead to                the development of formal rules governing hiring and promotion.                      This work is especially promising.  Substantively it will                  break new ground in our understanding of organizations'                         compliance with equal opportunity/affirmative action regulations.               Theoretically, it integrates legal theory with organization                     theory and the literature on organizational compliance.  As                     valuably, it focuses on the important, but often neglected, issue               of the impact of ceremonially adopted innovations on                            organizational practice.  Methodologically, the use of event                    history models to study organizational adaptation is innovative                 and their application in this context especially apt.",
