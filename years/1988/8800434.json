 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seismic isolation is now in the process of moving from the research             laboratory into  practice.  It has been enthusiastically accepted in            Japan but less so in the USA.  The reasons for the apparent reluctance          in the USA could be a lack of awareness of recent research results and          recent developments in implementation of this new technology.  This             research project is to develop a U.S. National Program on Seismic               Isolation for the implementation of base isolation in the U.S. and for          the dissemination of design methodologies and their eventual                    incorporation into building codes.  The planning for the program will be        based on the research agenda developed by the workshop conducted by the         Applied Technology Council to identify unsolved problems and unresolved         research issues in base isolation.  The objective of the research is to         develop a management structure, research program and technology transfer        mechanism to achieve the goals outlined in the previous workshop.//",
