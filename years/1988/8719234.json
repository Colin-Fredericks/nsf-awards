 "awd_abstract_narration": "The superior colliculus is a structure in the midbrain                          thought to mediate attention and orienting responses.  This                     structure integrates visual, auditory and tactile sensory                       information that comes from lower relay centers (ascending) and                 from the cerebral cortex (descending).  A single sensory nerve                  cell (neuron) often is functionally characterized by the                        properties of its \"receptive field,\" which is the set of criteria               for location, shape, movement or other aspects of a stimulus that               cause the cell to respond.  For a higher-order sensory neuron,                  this receptive field may be built up from the receptive fields of               many separate sensory neurons that send processes to converge on                that neuron.  Within the superior colliculus, it is unknown which               incoming (afferent) fibers converge on individual neurons, which                properties of the receptive field depend on which afferents, and                which receptive field properties of the output neurons are most                 directly involved in behavior.                                                  This project examines input to cells in the superior                            colliculus from neurons of the somatosensory system, responsive                 to touch on the face, limbs, or body surface.  Preliminary                      studies show that somatosensory neurons in the superior                         colliculus receive both ascending and descending inputs.                        Electrophysiological stimulation and recording techniques will be               used to identify the patterns of convergence of these different                 inputs on the collicular neurons, to determine correlations                     between inputs and receptive field properties, and determine                    which collicular neurons send output to the brain and spinal                    cord.  This work exploits the superior colliculus as a model with               a large base of information about its structure and function, to                understand how the nervous system builds particular sensory                     receptive fields from convergent individual sensory inputs.",
