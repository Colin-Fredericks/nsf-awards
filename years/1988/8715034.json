 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative geological field research in              Mauritania between Dr. Gary Kocurek, University of Texas in Austin              and Dr. Max Deynoux of the Laboratoire de Petrologie, University of             Poitiers, France.  The investigators plan to study a Saharan sand               sea (the Archar Erg in northwestern Mauritania) that, from all                  evidence, is actively migrating with the formation of a super                   bounding surface in its wake.  It has been recently recognized that             regional unconformities (termed super bounding surfaces) occur                  within ancient eolian (wind) sequences of the western U.S.  These               surfaces potentially allow local and regional correlation and the               recognition of distinct genetic sand-sea migration.  Super surfaces             formed by sand-sea migration are the least understood, largely                  because the modern small dune fields in the temperate climate of                North America are not viable analogues for large-scale,                         trade-wind-belt sand seas that are migrating.                                                                                                                   In this joint project Dr. Kocurek will benefit from French                      expertise, logistical support and access to an unusual geological               site.  The study will address processes of surface development with             sand-sea migration, including controls on sand deflation,                       preservation potential of sand-sea deposits, and formation of                   features characteristic of this type of terrestrial unconformity.",
