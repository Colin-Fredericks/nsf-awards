 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. Charles Siewert of North Carolina State                 University to collaborate in applied mathematics with Dr. J. Hovenier           of the Free University of Amsterdam, Dr. V. Boffi of the University             of Bologna, and Drs. C. Devaux and Y. Fouquart of the University of             Lille.  Using analytical and computational methods in particle                  transport theory, they are working on two basic problems in the                 general field of radiative transfer: the searchlight problem and the            general polarization problem.  In both cases, the F-N method, derived           originally by Dr. Siewert in the context of neutron transport theory,           is to be the basis of the numerical studies.  The classical                     searchlight problem in radiative transfer will be studied as a first            attempt to construct highly accurate numerical solutions to a class             of multi-dimensional transport problems.  In addition, exact analysis           and highly accurate numerical methods are to be used to construct and           implement computationally viable solutions to basic problems in                 radiative transfer models that include polarization effects.  A                 general radiant energy transfer model that includes polarization                effects will be used to study vector problems in transport theory               where the computational difficulties encountered for non-azimuthally            symmetric problems must be resolved.  Dr. Siewert has a distinguished           record of contributions to linear transport theory and a long history           of productive international collaboration.  The three foreign groups            with which he is collaborating are major centers of research in                 radiative transfer and numerical transport theory and a basis for               sharing new data and numerical results has been well established.                                                                                               The searchlight problem and polarization for multiply scattered                 radiation are two important problems first proposed over forty years            ago by Chandrasekhar.  They are  particularly challenging in terms of           numerical analysis methods.  In light of their past work and the                increasing power of computers, it is anticipated that Dr. Siewert's             continued collaboration with his European colleagues  will contribute           significantly to the establishment of definitive solutions to these             challenging problems in radiative transfer theory.  In addition, the            results of their work on the polarization problem may offer a useful            diagnostic tool in inferring physical properties from observed                  intensity and polarization profiles.",
