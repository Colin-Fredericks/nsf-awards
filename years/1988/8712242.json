 "awd_abstract_narration": "In stable, long lasting social groups the progress of each              individual through life may be viewed as a trajectory, in which                 future position is influenced by past history.  In most                         vertebrate populations it is impossible for an investigator to                  appreciate this perspective because studies are relatively short.               By employing a population in individually recognizable animals                  with histories known since 1969, this project will make possible                a lifetime perspective.  A variety of difficult questions will be               addressed.  When do individuals with the greatest lifetime                      reproductive success begin to breed?  Should an individual                      emigrate before beginning to breed?  If so, when?  Such questions               are strongly influenced by social rank.  How stable are the ranks               of individuals over their lifetimes?  Does the status of an                     individual early in life have a lifelong effect on its                          reproductive success?  These and other questions can only be                    answered when a population of individually recognizable                         individuals is studied intensively for a long period.  The                      proposed research will take advantage of this unique opportunity                to study the causes and consequences of social dominance in long-               term perspective.",
