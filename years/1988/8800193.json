 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Matisieae consists of 10 genera and about 80 species of trees               distributed throughout most lowland, neotropical rainforests.                   Taxonomic studies on the tribe are underway but the relatively                  abundant morphological, chemical and biogeographic data are                     presently insufficient to determine unambiguously the correct                   phylogeny.  This two-year postdoctoral fellowship research                      effort will include the collection of leaf and seed material of                 representative Matisieae and other Bombacaceae in Colombia,                     Panama and Costa Rica, with subsequent use of restriction                       endonuclease analysis of the chloroplast genomes.  These                        analyses will generate statistically robust phylogenies that will               allow resolution of historical problems of classification within                the Bombacaceae and will provide, for the first time, a certain                 evolutionary framework upon which to evaluate traditional data.                                                                                                 An understanding of the evolutionary polarities of morphological                character states within the Bombacaceae will permit re-                         valuation of its evolutionary and taxonomic relationships with                  the economically important cotton (Malvaceae) and cacao                         (Sterculiaceae) families and other members of the order Malvales.               From a broader perspective, two additional benefits will result.                First, evolutionary studies in this lineage of trees may be                     applicable to many other woody groups of wet, neotropical                       forests.  Secondly, data on the chloroplast genomes of these                    long-lived woody plants with good fossil records will benefit our               understanding of the role of generation time in chloroplast DNA                 evolution.",
