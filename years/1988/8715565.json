 "awd_abstract_narration": "Society is experiencing the emergence of a post-industrial era                  characterized by greater knowledge, complexity, and turbulence.  One            effect of this trend is that decision-related meetings are becoming             more frequent and more important.  At the same time, the decisions              confronting groups are becoming more complex and must be made more              quickly, and with greater participation than in the past.  As part of           the transition into this new age, organizational scientists are                 exploring advanced technologies that might facilitate effective and             efficient group meetings.  One such technology is the Group Decision            Support System (GDSS), a computer-based system that attempts to                 facilitate communication and provide decision support for meetings.             This multi-year project drawing on the management science, speech               communication, and strategic planning disciplines will test and refine          a theory of how groups use and adapt to group decision and support              system.  Decision makers have already taken advantage of this new               technology and will do so increasingly in the future.                                                                                                           The project has the following long-range goals: (1) to build a general          theory of GDSSs and other social technologies; (2) to identify design           factors that contribute to GDSS effectiveness; and (3) to discover              possible problems with GDSSs, so decision-makers can guard against              them.  The research will focus on decision outcomes such as quality,            efficiency, commitment, and team building as a result of how GDSSs              influence group interaction processes and how groups adapt and change           the GDSS as they use it.  In the early years of the project, a series           of laboratory experiments will systematically vary the design of the            GDSS, the extent of the decision network, and the group context.  As            the project progresses, the research will move into the field with the          goal of expanding the theory to include the larger social context of            the organization.",
