 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will explore the interrelationships between               historical patterns of landscape use and consequent variations in               patterns in ecological succession.  The workshop will be held 28-               31 January 1988 and will consist of formal presentations dealing                with specific landscapes by historians and ecologists, as well as               discussions and a field trip.  Workshop goals include: 1.                       Facilitation of interaction among historians, historical                        geographers, and ecologists; 2. Evaluation of the economic,                     social, technical, and cultural factors that have influenced the                history of land use on different landscapes; 3. Evaluation of the               effects of variations in landscape history and landscape                        utilization on patterns of community succession and ecosystem                   recovery; 4. Consideration of the interactions between                          successional trajectories and patterns of land use; 5. Prediction               of future trends expected in land use and succession; 6.  and                   Critical analysis of ecological methods for reconstruction of                   landscape history.  In addition to a formal report to the NSF on                workshop findings, the meeting will produce a series of articles                in professional journals.",
