 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Karl Seff, Department of             Chemistry, University of Hawaii, to pursue with Dr. Yang Kim,                   Department of Chemistry, Pusan National University, for a period of 24          months, a program of cooperative research to continue the synthetic and         crystallographic study of the intrazeolitic chemistry of silver in              zeolite A.  New conditions for the preparation of silver clusters               within the zeolite, which may result in the formation of new clusters           of high symmetry, will be tried.  The crystallographic study of the             structure of these clusters will be determined by x-ray diffraction             methods.                                                                                                                                                        This is a basic research project dealing with the synthesis and                 structure of silver atoms and silver ions in zeolite A and the                  preparation of molecular complexes of this silver within the large              cavity of zeolite.  While small clusters of metal atoms are known to            have pronounced catalytic activity for a variety of organic reactions,          this project is not concerned with the potential catalytic properties           of silver in zeolite A.  Drs. Seff and Kim are highly respected                 scientists who have collaborated successfully in the past, under NSF            Grants No. INT-8316234 and INT-8113065.  The present project will allow         them to continue this collaboration.  This project is relevant to the           objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to         increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists            and engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas,            skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual          benefit.",
