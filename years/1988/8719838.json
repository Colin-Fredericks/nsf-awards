Mesoscale phenomena are                not well sampled by the operational weather network; therefore,                 progress is made through episodic field experiments specifically                designed to study mesoscale processes.                                               The principal investigator will study a broad range of                     mesoscale problems using data collected during NSF sponsored                    research programs.  Numerical models of the convective and                      stratiform regions of mesoscale convective systems will be                      applied to and tested on analyzed data sets collected during the                Global Atmospheric Research Program's Atlantic Tropical                         Experiment (GATE) and the Oklahoma-Kansas Preliminary Regional                  Experiment for STORM-Central (PRE-STORM: STORM stands for                       Stormscale Operational and Research Meteorology).                                    Multiple Doppler derived wind fields of mesoscale convective               systems observed during the PRE-STORM and of Hurricane Norbert                  will be constructed and used for quantitative diagnostic studies                of the budgets of water, heat, momentum and wind circulation.                   The vertical distribution of momentum, wind circulation and                     large-scale environmental heating associated with these storm                   systems will be estimated from this data. Such calculations are                 of great importance to mesoscale research since the effect of                   these mesoscale systems on the larger scale circulation is an                   unknown energy transfer mechanism which is of great importance in               controlling the weather.",
