 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to determine the relationships between magmatic                 evolution and tectonic history in the Tuxtla Volcanic Field,                    veracruz, Mexico, a magmatic arc where both alkaline and calc-                  alkaline magma types have erupted.  The PI will try to determine                the relationship between volcanism and tectonism by                             characterizing the isotopic and trace element composition of the                magmatic source, and determining the age of initiation of                       volcanism and its relationship to tectonic events occurring in                  the area at the time.  The depth at which melting and                           fractionation took place will also be studied, and the entire                   area will be compared to other areas of the calc-alkaline Mexican               Volcanic Belt.  A volcanic hazards assesment is also planned.                   Geologic mapping will be used to determine stratigraphic                        relationships.  Chemical and isotopic analyses will aid in                      determining the characteristics of the magma source and its                     evolution through time, and, combined with mineralogical                        analyses, will help unravel the chemical evolution of the magmas                and determine the temperatures and pressures involved in magmatic               evolution. Potassium-Argon and radiocarbon age dating of rocks                  will be used to determine the age of initiation of volcanism, the               rates of magmatic evolution and the recent eruptive history.                    Completion of the project should give a better understanding of                 the relationships between alkaline and calc-alkaline magmatism                  and tectonism in the Mexican Volcanic Belt and elsewhere.  In                   addition, it will provide information critical to the well being                of inhabitants of the area in the event of future volcanic                      eruption.",
