 "awd_abstract_narration": "The analysis of the light emitted by atoms and molecules in                the upper atmosphere leads to a knowledge of the chemical and                   physical reactions taking place there as energy in the form of                  solar ultraviolet radiation is absorbed during the day, and in                  the form of high speed streams of electrons and positively                      charged atoms is absorbed at high latitudes at night. To relate                 the optical observations to specific chemical reactions and to                  infer upper atmosphere temperature and composition and energy                   inputs, it is necessary to perform controlled laboratory                        experiments to determine the parameters that need to be used in                 numerical models of the processes.  This award is for laboratory                work to provide such parameters for reactions involving nitrogen                and oxygen atoms and molecules, and to help understand the                      production of nitric oxide in aurorae, that is subsequently                     transported downwards into the middle atmosphere and affects the                concentration of ozone there.",
