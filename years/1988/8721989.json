 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 1970s saw the first sustained and systematic studies of                     engineering ethics in the U.S.  These studies have been                         successful in identifying problems and raising consciousness                    about the need for ethical deliberation and education among                     technical professionals.  There is at least one aspect which has                been neglected, however: investigation of parallel or related                   work in other countries.  This project will break new ground by                 systematically inventorying and analyzing engineering ethics in                 other countries.  The result will be an \"Introduction to                        Engineering Ethics in Countries Other than the United States: An                Analysis with Annotated Catalog and Bibliography.\"  This                        scholarly survey will include a collection of engineering ethics                codes or related documents, an overview and critical assessment                 of related discussions, comparisons with engineering ethics in                  the U.S., a list of relevant professional organizations and                     institutions, and an annotated bibliography of publications.                    Unlike all previous engineering ethics studies in English, it                   will emphasize foreign language works (but will provide English                 annotations).  Two issues likely to be put forth for greater                    consideration by the technical and scholarly communities in North               America are those related to the possibilities of a socialist-                  communitarian and a religious engineering ethics, in contrast to                the predominantly individualist and secular versions of                         engineering ethics which currently prevail in the U.S.                                                                                                          This project will make a unique contribution to broadening our                  scholarly understanding of different cultural approaches to                     engineering ethics.  The resulting document will be a resource                  for scholars and for classroom teaching.  The principal                         investigator is exceedingly well qualified to undertake the                     effort; he has a proven track record and language skills and                    connections overseas.  His institutional base is very good.  The                research design is appropriate and feasible; costs, including                   funds for necessary translation, are very reasonable.  Results                  are likely to be widely distributed and useful.  Support in the                 amount of $43,463 is recommended.",
