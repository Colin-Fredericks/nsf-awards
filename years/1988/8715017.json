 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Prof.                    Joseph W. Rich, Ohio State University, and Dr. Jean-Pierre                      Martin of the Laboratory of Molecular Energetics and Macroscopic                Combustion at the Ecole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures,                      Chatenay, France.  The research will involve theoretical and                    experimental studies of physical gas dynamics and molecular                     energy transfer, with a concentration on the flow of molecular                  gases in a high state of vibrational or rotational                              nonequilibrium.  Dye laser measurements will be performed on                    reaction kinetics in NO and CO gases, emitted from nozzles                      designed to produce the desired nonequilibrium flow.                            Theoretical analyses will involve calculation of the rate                       constants for collisions between molecules, and the evolution of                translational temperature, pressure, and density along                          supersonic free jets.  The theoretical results will then be                     compared to the experimental results.                                                                                                                           Dye laser diagnostics and infrared emission measurements will be                performed at Ohio State University, in collaboration with the                   French researchers, who have considerable expertise in these                    areas.  Computer modeling will be undertaken at both                            institutions and the resulting codes will be shared.  A                         systematic exchange of theoretical and analytical results will                  be initiated via computer networks.  The results of this work                   may have important applications in such fields as high-energy                   gas lasers, hypersonic vehicles, and supersonic ramjet aircraft.",
