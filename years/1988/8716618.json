Dove of the University of             Wisconsin and Professor Sadashi Hatano of the University of Nagoya,             Japan.  United States, Japanese, and invited third-country                      participants will meet at the National Institute for Basic Biology              in Okazaki, Japan in May 1988.  Seminar topics will include (1) cell            motility, (2) cytoskeleton proteins and their genes, (3) cell                   differentiation and the cell cycle, (4) extranuclear genes, and (5)             new techniques for the study of cellular biology.                                                                                                               The myxomycete Physarum polycephalum is considered to be an ideal               organism for the study of cell motility, nuclear division, and cell             differentiation.  The Japanese have done pioneering studies on                  cytoplasmic streaming and cytoskeletal proteins using this organism,            while in the U.S., research on the molecular genetics of Physarum               has advanced rapidly.  This seminar will provide a forum for the                exchange of research results and ideas, and will hopefully lead to              increased collaboration between cellular biologists of our two                  countries.",
