 "awd_abstract_narration": "Charged-Couple Device (CCD) image sensors are the detectors of                  choice in astronomy for reasons of quantum efficiency, linearity,               dynamic range, spectral response, precise image registration, and               suitability for digital image processing.  Due to their small                   size, current CCDs cover approximately 1-4% of typical telescope                focal-plane images, and are thus not individually suitable for                  statistical astronomy.                                                                                                                                          Lee et al propose to construct a wide-field CCD camera suitable                 for statistical astronomy through the use of an array of CCD                    sensors.  A mosaic of four Tektronix 2048x2048 pixel CCDs will be               used in an array of 4096x4096 pixels over an area of approximately              110x110 mm.  Multiple dis-registered exposures of a given field                 will be digitally filtered, corrected, and merged to create a                   complete image (approximately 4500x4500 pixels) without defects or              inter-CCD blind spots.  A fast special-purpose image processor                  will perform this operation in real time.  Special attention will               be given to providing this processor with the capability for full               image analysis, since the large volumes of data generated by the                CCD array would quickly overwhelm ordinary computing facilities.                Such a system can greatly improve the scientific capabilities and               productivity of existing ground-based telescopes at a modest cost.              This proposal is a cost-sharing collaboration between AT&T Bell                 Laboratories, Tektronix, and Lassen Research.",
