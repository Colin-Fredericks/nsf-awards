 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent successes of theoretical chemistry with improved                     programs and faster computers have generated a need for still                   faster machines.  Experienced users wish to solve larger and                    larger problems of more and more relevance to the experimental                  chemist.  Similarly, experimental chemists, seeing these                        results, are compelled to become new users.   The acquisition                   of state-of-the-art computational equipment is essential to the                 modern chemistry department carrying out of frontier reseach.                                                                                                   The Department of Chemistry of Vanderbilt University will use                   this award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program to                 help acquire an advanced parallel- and vector-processing                        research computer.  The areas of chemical research that will be                 enhanced by the acquisition include the following:                                                                                                              1) The study of core ionization in atoms and molecules                          2) Theoretical studies of molecular energetics and novel                           molecular structures                                                         3) A collaboration between theoretical and experimental                            organic chemistry                                                            4) Structure-reactivity relationships of ligands to nonmetals                      in hypervalent species                                                       5) Mathematical modeling of in situ clean-up methods.",
