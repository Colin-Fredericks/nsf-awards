 "awd_abstract_narration": "An engineering study has revealed that the pier and wharf of the                Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Nimitz Marine Facility are                 in need of immediate repair.  Saltwater penetration into concrete               of the support beams has corroded reinforcing steel, resulting in               decreased loading capacity and restricted use by ship loading                   equipment.  The Facility is a major regional port providing                     docking for four Scripps-operated research vessels, the MELVILLE,               THOMAS WASHINGTON, NEW HORIZON, and ROBERT GORDON SPROUL as well                as the Scripps-operated research platforms FLIP and ORB, the NOAA               fisheries research vessel DAVID STARR JORDAN, and other visiting                research vessels.                                                                                                                                               This grant will contribute funds for the repair of the pier and                 wharf.  Additional support is being sort from the state of                      California and other federal agencies.                                                                                                                          The Project Director, Dr George Shor, is Associate Director,                    Scripps Institution of Oceanography.  He is fully qualified to                  direct this project having had considerable experience in                       overseeing marine facility operations.",
