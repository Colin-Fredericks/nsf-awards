 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the functions of the products of                 transcriptional early region 4 (E4) of human adenoviruses types 2               and 5.  E4 covers about 3000 base pairs near the right end of the               adenoviral genome, and E4 products are known to play roles in the               expression of viral late genes (at the level of the synthesis of                viral late mRNA), the replication of viral DNA, the assembly of                 virus particles, and the inhibition of host cell protein                        synthesis after infection.  Both genetic and biochemical                        approaches will be employed to examine E4 function.  Genetic                    studies will include  completion of the detailed characterization               of a series of E4 deletion mutants to determine the roles in the                viral life cycle and the locations of genes and sites in E4, the                construction of specific E4 point mutants to probe the functions                of gene products already implicated in regulatory events, and the               isolation of second-site revertants of E4 deletion mutants to                   identify viral sites and gene products that interact with  E4                   proteins.  Biochemical studies will concentrate on the roles                    played in late protein synthesis by E4 products.  In Vitro                      systems will first be developed that duplicate the disruption of                late gene expression observed in E4 mutant infections.  Those                   systems will be used to precisely define the defect, and in                     conjunction with E4 products overproduced by recombinant DNA                    techniques, will be used in studies of the interaction of E4                    proteins with RNA, other viral gene products, and the components                of the host cell genetic expression machinery.  The effects of E4               mutations on viral DNA replication, fiber synthesis, and                        transformation will also be investigated in greater detail in an                effort to determine how E4 products are involved in those                       processes.                                                                                                                                                      This project will provide information of the regulatory that                    occur in cells infected with human adenoviruses.  Emphasis will                 be placed on analyzing a region of the viral genome known as E4                 that regulates viral late gene expression, DNA replication,                     assembly of virus particles, and inhibition of host cell                        metablism.  Dr. Ketner has developed a host cell line that                      contains and expresses the viral E4 region.  As a result, viral                 E4 mutants, which would otherwise be lethal, can be propagated                  and analyzed.  The results of these provide an understanding of                 the regulatory functions of the different genes within the E4                   region.",
