 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of eolian deposits have been severely handicapped by the                lack of tools for internal correlation.  However, recent                        recognition of unconformities within eolian units (termed super                 bounding surfaces) allows local and regional correlation, and the               recognition of distinct genetic sequences composing eolian units.               These unconformities represent hiatuses in sand-sea development                 and result from climatic, tectonic, and eustatic events.  It is                 proposed to apply this new concept to a study of the Jurassic Page              Sandstone on the Colorado Plateau.  This unit affords excellent,                almost continuously exposed outcrops across the entire breadth of               the original Page sand sea into the laterally adjacent Carmel                   marine formation.  Work thus far has recognized several super                   surfaces in the Page Sandstone.  The genetic sequences that                     compose the Page Sandstone are distinct.  The proposed work                     consists of (1) identifying super surfaces within the Page, (2)                 carefully correlating these through a series of closely spaced                  stratigraphic sections into the Carmel Formation, (3) describing                and interpreting genetic sequences bounded by the surfaces, and                 (4) addressing the causes of the super-surface development and                  pulses of sandsea formation.  The significance of this work is                  that is is a pioneer study developing the tools of super bounding               surfaces for understanding laterally extensive, thick eolian                    sequences.  It is believed that these unconformable surfaces can                be of tremendous value in understanding the genetic history of                  eolian units, and potentially of utility in correlation of eolian               units.",
