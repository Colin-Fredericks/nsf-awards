 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Ocean Sciences Instrumentation development project will                    develop a timed-release telemetering data capsule for use on                    moored and bottom-mounted instruments such as current meters.  A                goal for the project is the ability to attach one or more data                  capsules to instrumentation for long-term deployment.  A capsule's              controller will compress, encode, and store data collected by the               instrument.  At some predetermined time, the controller will                    activate a release enabling the capsule to rise to the surface,                 whereupon it will transmit the stored data ashore via a satellite               communications link.  Various data encoding and telemetring                     schemes for a micro-computer based controller will be developed                 and interfaced to a choice of existing data recorders.                          Instrumentation mounting assemblies and capsule release mechanisms              will also be developed and field tested.                                                                                                                        The use of such data capsules will provide logistic and scientific              advantages over present systems that require the entire instrument              package to be retrieved before data is collected.  In remote                    geographical areas where data is sparse and expensive to collect,               long-term instrumentation could be deployed with the scientist                  being able to receive data periodically.  Not only would there be               an indication that the instruments were working properly, but                   there will also be the option of progressively analyzing data and               altering experimental design based on received information.  Data               capsules also enhance the possibility of using expendable                       instrumentation that have certain economical advantages.",
