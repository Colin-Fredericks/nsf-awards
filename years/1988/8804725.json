 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the middle Carboniferous, continental glaciation began in                the Southern Hemisphere, marine faunas suffered an extinction                   event, and land plants radiated.  Glaciations certainly cause                   high-latitude cooling; they may also ameliorate (warm and moisten)              equatorial climates.  The differing responses of marine faunas and              land floras to glaciation may relate to their differing responses               to equatorial amelioration.  Evidence for this amelioration during              glacial onset comes from climatically-sensitive sediments and                   faunal migrations.  If mid-Carboniferous glaciation ameliorated                 equatorial climates on land: 1, pre-glacial, seasonally adapted,                equatorial plants should have migrated away from the equator into               the low and middle latitudes; 2, the equatorial zone should have                experienced increased origination rates following glaciation; the               mid-Carboniferous radiation of land plants should have been                     centered on the equatorial zone.  Data on floral mirgrations will               establish the terrestrial paleoclimatic history of the mid-                     Carboniferous.  Data on changes in the latitudinal diversity                    gradient of plants during this interval will carroborate that                   history.  Data on the diversity and evolutionary rates                          (origination and extinction) of mid-Carboniferous plants,                       globally, within floral realms, and latitudinally, will indicate                whether the mid-Carboniferous floral radiation was centered on the              equatorial zone.  A study of mid-Carboniferous phytogeography will              allow evaluation of the link between biotic diversity,                          biogeographic differentiation and the pole-to-equator climatic                  gradient.",
