 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Staubli is analyzing memory in the olfactory system,                        encompassing studies ranging from basic physiology to the more                  global cognitive operations of learning and forgetting.  Her                    previous studies have demonstrated that brief bursts of                         electrical stimulation to the pathway which connects the nose to                the brain, when given at the frequency at which rats sniff air,                 are treated by the animals as if they perceived real odors.  In                 standard learning situations animals will quickly acquire a                     discrimination between these \"electrical odors.\"  As a result,                  the connections between the stimulated axons and the target                     neurons in the olfactory cortex show long-lasting physiological                 changes (potentiation).  Importantly, the synaptic connections of               naive, non-learning animals show no such changes.  This suggests                that the observed physiological changes might reflect the                       formation of memories of the \"electrical odors.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                Dr. Staubli has also demonstrated that long-term potentiation                   (LTP) in another brain region involved in learning (the                         hippocampus) can be reversed by long trains of low frequency                    stimulation.  She is now examining LTP in the lateral olfactory                 tract, testing whether it can be reversed.  If so, then the                     behavioral effects of the manipulation will be measured;  that                  is, does reversal of LTP in the olfactory system eliminate the                  memory of the \"electrical odors.\"  These experiments should                     provide evidence regarding the possibility that memory decay is                 due to an active, rather than a passive process.",
