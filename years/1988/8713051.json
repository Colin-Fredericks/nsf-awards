 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fatty acid metabolism, especially the biosynthesis of long                      chain fatty acids in eukaryotic cells, is the focus of our                      research.  In this project we plan to study the mechanism of                    action and structure-function relationship of the fatty acid                    synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase of the yeast Saccharmyces                   cerevisiae.  For the synthase, the entry of the substrates,                     acetyl and malonyl groups, and the role of the transacylases                    in the process of chai  elongation will be investigated.  in                    these studies we plan to establish the order and kinetics of                    transfer of the  B-ketoacyl derivative.  Synthase from yeast                    mutansts defective in acetylk transcyclase activity or lacks                    4'-phospopantetheine will be used in these studies.  Foir the                   carbozylase we will determine thr organization of the partial                   activities on the subunit protein as well as the site of                        biotim attachment.  Also, we plan to continue our studies of                    the structure ans properties of the synthase abd carbioxylase                   genes.  The avcailability of these genes will make it                           possible for functional studies of the protins altered by                       site-directed mutagenesis.  The genes or DNA  fragments                         derived therefrom will be inserted inframe in special                           vectors, expressed in appropriate hosts and thge proteins                       produced will be characterized and usled in reconstitution                      studies.  Cloning will be an exceptionlly poerful oapproach                     to understanding the physiological revelance and structure-                     function relationships of these complex multifunctional                         proteins.",
