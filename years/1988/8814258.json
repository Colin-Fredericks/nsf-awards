The Indian           Co-organizer of the conference is Dr. Radhakrishma of IIT, Madras who           also is representing the Committee on Science and Technology in                 Developing Countries (COSTED) of UNESCO.  The conference will deal              with (1) linear and nonlinear spectroscopy, (2) optical phase                   conjugation, (3) nonlinear processes, (4) material processing by                lasers, (5) laser imaging and holography, and (6) laser systems and             devices.  A conference proceedings is expected to be published by               COSTED.  In addition to U.S. and Indian participants, some 30                   scientists from other countries are expected to give talks and                  present research papers.                                                                                                                                        Scope:  Both U.S. and India have scientists who are very active in              the field of spectroscopy, and laser applications in spectroscopy and           in optics.  In addition to providing a forum for them to exchange               views and interact, this conference will have the added benefit of              providing opportunities for scientists from developing countries and            from other western nations to exchange information on latest advances           in the field, resources, problems and techniques in this area of high           technology.",
