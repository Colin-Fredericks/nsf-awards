 "awd_abstract_narration": "During enzymatic hydrolysis, cellulose particles are attacked by                cellulases resulting in the production of fermentable sugars.                   However, prior to the production of significant amounts of fermentable          sugars, considerable fragmentation of the initial cellulose particles           occurs.  Although several investigators have reported on this                   phenomena, there has been very little effort at assessing the rate and          extent of fragmentation, nor have there been analyses of the influence          of cellulose structural features and cellulase characteristics on the           rate and extent of fragmentation.  The purpose of this investigation            is to experimentally and mathematically analyze cellulose                       fragmentation.  The influence of mean particles size, cellulosepore             volume and crystallinity, and the characteristics of cellulases of              Thermomonospora fusca on the rate and extent of fragmentation will be           analyzed.                                                                                                                                                       Cellulose is the most abundant carbohydrate produced by the biosphere.          It is a major component of plant cell walls.  In addition, cellulose            represents 40 percent of the municipal solid waste generated across             the country.  Over the last 10 years there has been considerable                interest in taping these renewable resources for industrial chemicals           and foods.  Part of this interest is stimulated by the relatively low           cost of cellulosic materials.  A number of microorganisms produce               enzymes (cellulases) that are capable of converting cellulose to                fermentable sugars.  Part of this conversion process is the break-up            of cellulose particles into smaller particles.  This fragmentation              process is one of the least understood aspects of enzymatic                     hydrolysis.  The purpose of this investigation is to analyze and to             mathematically model the fragmentation process associated with the              enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose.  The model to be developed would be          useful for assessing the feasibility of using cellulases for the                production of dietary fibers and provide more insight into the overall          mechanism for producing fermentable sugars.",
