 "awd_abstract_narration": "The curriculum is being enhanced by the establishment of a dedicated            microcomputer laboratory component to supplement and expand the present         laboratory exercises taught in the chemistry courses.  Twenty                   computers, two printers, two plotters and the requisite software are            being purchased.  The equipment is being used to reinforce experiments;         to familiarize students with modern analytical techniques by using              computer simulations, particularly in areas where expensive                     instrumentation is not available; and to provide numerous samples for           examination and analysis to supplement experiences in the laboratory.           The additional laboratory training is helping students gain further             knowledge and experience necessary for successful entry and completion          of upper division curriculum.  Students are also increasing their               competency and familiarity with computers, a basic tool of modern               science and industry.
