The key scientific objectives of this initiative                  are set forth in the National Academy of Sciences Report, \"The                  Mid-Ocean Ridge - A Dynamic Global System\". The major goal of                   RIDGE is to understand the geophysical, geochemical, and                        geobiological causes and consequences of the energy transfer                    associated with the global ridge system and the creation of new                 oceanic crust. Six high priority problem areas have been defined                for the RIDGE Program:                                                                  *The flow of mantle,the generation of melt, and the                     transport of magmas beneath mid-ocean ridges                                            *The processes which transform magma into oceanic crust                         *The processes that control the segmentation and                        episodicity of lithosphere accretion                                                    *The physical, chemical, and biological processes involved                       in the interactions between circulating seawater and the                        solid lithosphere                                                              *The interactions of organisms with the physical and                    chemical environments in submarine hydrothermal systems                                 *The distribution and intensity of mid-ocean hydrothermal                        venting and the influence which vents have on the ocean                         environment                                                                                                                                            The objective of the next two years of planning is to translate                 the recommendations of the National Academy report into a                       scientifically focused research program. The planning activity                  will involve both U.S. and international marine scientists and                  will be coordinated through a U.S. planning office at the                       University of Washington.",
