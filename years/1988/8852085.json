 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides equipment needed to create a complete                research environment as a training model within the Genetic Engineering         Technology Program.  This strong new program is designed to provide             the conceptual and technical background needed for women to become              leaders in professional fields based on modern biological research.             The research environment permits training in the use of recombinant DNA         techniques, DNA sequencing, and monoclonal antibodies, while teaching           central concepts of molecular biology.  Student research projects               extend the use of relevant techniques to areas of active research,              while developing self-confidence and independent thinking in women              majoring in biology.                                                                                                                                                 The equipment (fluorescence microscope, chromatography cabinet,            ultralow freezer, data acquisition computer and benchtop centrifuge)            extends a successful curriculum and is housed in a new facility. With           it, undergraduates can conduct research in the area of                          immunodiagnostics that is of potentially publishable quality, lending           greatly increased credibility to the training.                                                                                                                       The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
