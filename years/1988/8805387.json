The symposium          is sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences, the U.S. Geological           Survey, and the Association of American State Geologists.  The purpose          of providing student subsidies is to expose beginning scientists to an          important new technology early in their careers in hopes that they will         incorporate GIS into their graduate research programs.  This award will         improve the effectiveness of the conference and it will simultaneously          augment the nation's supply of scientists trained in GIS by providing           superior students with timely exposure to the technology and its                benefits.",
