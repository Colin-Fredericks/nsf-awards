 "awd_abstract_narration": "A six-week field biology and geology workshop will be conducted by              University of Dayton scientists for 20 Middle School teachers.  It will         focus on the acquisition and development of skills in problem solving           and an additional knowledge base in ecology and geology.  Emphasis will         be placed on applied biology, field biology and environmental geology.          The target group of teachers are the less well-prepared Middle School           teachers in southwestern Ohio, including both large urban centers, such         as Dayton, Cincinnati and Columbus and suburban areas surrounding the           cities and the University.                                                                                                                                      The first three weeks of the program will include an introduction to the        principles of geology and ecology as well as discussion of local                resources and their uses. Following that, the group will travel by vans         to a field facility outside of Denver, Colorado to investigate the              biology and geology of the area around the High Altitude Laboratory on          the slopes of Mt. Evans.                                                                                                                                        Because this project includes both a home-based study and a distant             field site, teachers will experience a unique opportunity to participate        in an exciting environment, and apply the field techniques to their             local environment.  Modules for school use will be developed with the           assistance of project staff and mentor teams selected from previous             participants.  Six evening meetings and several field trips are included        in the follow-up plans for the academic year.",
