 "awd_abstract_narration": "An international symposium on \"Room Air Contaminant Distribution\"               will be held at the University of Illinois Allerton Park Retreat                during Winter 1988.  Symposium attendees will be limited to 50 to 70,           including some international experts invited by the Symposium                   Planning Committee to share their expertise, and the remainder                  selected on the basis of abstracts submitted to the Planning                    Committee.  A minimum of 50% of the participants will be full-time              faculty at United States universities.  The purposes of the symposium           will be to: 1) exchange knowledge among experts from the diverse                types of fields with interest in this topic (e.g., architectural                engineers, mechanical engineers, chemical engineers, agricultural               engineers, physicists), and including university, industry and                  government researchers, 2) define a research needs agenda for the               National Science Foundation (i.e., provide both direction and a                 statement of importance for research on this topic) and 3) help                 develop and organize the expertise of engineers and scientists from             United States universities on this subject.  The symposium will be              organized into:  1) brief technical presentations by each                       participant, 2) whole group and small group discussions of research,            research needs and importance, 3) informal discussions in a retreat             setting (lodging and meals will be furnished at the site) and 4) a              wrap-up session to agree on major recommendations.  All participants            will receive                                                                    advance summaries of other participant's abstracts.  Following                  the symposium, a proceedings including participant's papers and                 the recommendations from the symposium will be prepared.",
