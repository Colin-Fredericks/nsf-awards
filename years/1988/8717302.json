 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer integration of design and construction activities can                  dramatically increase efficiency, by eliminating duplication of data            and effort, reducing errors, decreasing design-construction time,               improving scheduling, providing better management information, etc.             However, before true computer integration can become a reality, many            theoretical and practical problems must be resolved.  There are two             types of integration to be considered, and two sides to the problem.            The two types of integration are:  a) vertical, across the planning,            design, construction and operation phases, and b) horizontal, across            disciplines in each of the phases (e.g. in the design phase, across             architectural, civil, structural, mechanical and electrical                     disciplines).  Two specific research activities will be executed, one           quite narrow and specific, and the other broader.  The narrower topic           is concerned with the design of a database to support integration of            structural design and construction, and specifically with the key               role that connections play in this database.  The broader topic,                concerned with representation and processing of facts, rules, and               procedures will be limited to clarifying basic concepts and                     identifying needs and techniques.  The research is expected to make             the following contributions: 1) The state of the art of design- and             construction-related database design will be advanced.  2) The state            of the art of knowledge processing for integrated software systems              will be advanced.  The techniques which have been developed only in             theory, or only for problems not related to construction, will be               explored, and their appropriateness for construction applications               will be assessed.  This will help form a foundation for efficient               development of Computer Integrated Construction systems.  3) Closer             collaboration and communication will be developed between researchers           who have similar broad interests but are in widely different                    disciplines.  Collaboration and communication will also be cemented             between industry and the university.",
