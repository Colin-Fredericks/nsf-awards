 "awd_abstract_narration": "The technique of X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool for                   the determination of the molecular structure of compounds as                    diverse as small polypeptides and complex metal clusters.  When                 combined with modern computing hardware and software, the                       technique is remarkably efficient to put into practice.  The                    acquisition of X-ray crystallographic instrumentation markedly                  improves the ability of chemists to carry out frontier research.                                                                                                The Department of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota will                 use this award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation                        Program to help acquire, operate and maintain important                         upgrades for its current X-ray facility.  The new                               instrumentation will be used to enhance research in the                         following areas of chemistry:                                                                                                                                   1) Crystallographic evidence for nucleophilic attack on                            nitriles                                                                     2) Hydrogen bonding patterns in solid state organic molecules                   3) Structures of new organic and organometallic compounds                       4) Structures of new transition metal carbonyl clusters                         5) Synthesis and reactivity of gold transition metal alloy                         compounds with applications as catalysts and new materials.",
