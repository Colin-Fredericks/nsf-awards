 "awd_abstract_narration": "A seven week summer program at Louisiana State University is proposed           in which students entering the eleventh or twelfth grade at the end of          the summer will: 1) take short courses on science subjects; 2) work in          a faculty research laboratory; 3) participate in discussions on science         careers, science methodology and scientific ethics; and 4) take weekend         field trips to nearby scientific and industrial facilities.  Six of the         students will be commuters and six will reside in campus dormitories.           (The residential students will be recruited nationwide.)  The short             courses in science will take place in the mornings of the first three           weeks of the program.  Participation in faculty research projects will          start in the afternoons of the first three weeks, and continue full-            time in the final four weeks.  The twelve students will be divided              among the six departments of the College of Basic Sciences:                     Biochemistry, Botany, Chemistry, Microbiology, Physics and Astronomy,           and Zoology and Physiology.  The students will be expected to develop a         science project for submission to a science fair, junior academy of             science, or Junior Science and Humanities Symposium.  Follow-up                 activities will center around reporting on progress in the science              project (for all students), but will also include classroom visits by           staff members and a Saturday renewal session (for local students).",
