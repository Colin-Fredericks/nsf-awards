The development of new synthetic tools based on                       catalytic systems has the potential to provide more economic,                   pollution-free methods for the synthesis of the complex                         materials for industry and agriculture.                                                                                                                         The ultimate goal is to design and develop multi-functional                     multicatalyst systems which will permit multi-step synthesis in                 one-pot in a highly organized manner.  This project includes                    three sub-projects:  (i)  mechanistic study of mixed metal                      catalyst systems focusing on the mechanism of CoRh(CO)7                         catalysis including high pressure FT-IR study on the behavior                   of this unique mixed-metal complex regarding the                                hydroformylation-amido-carbonylation process;  (ii)                             elucidation of the mechanism of amidocarbonylation by                           stereochemical approach which will resolve a historical                         mystery, i.e., water cleaves acylcobalt bond selectively in the                 presence of high pressure hydrogen, by designing bicyclic                       intermediates bearing strict steric requirements that can                       unambiguously distinguish among the possible mechanisms                         proposed;  (iii)  chelation-directed regio- and stereocontrol                   in carbonylations, which will systematically introduce                          chelation control, for the first time, to carbonylations and                    apply it to the catalytic asymmetric synthesis.",
