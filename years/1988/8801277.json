 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bob Devaney will continue his exciting work on planar                      dynamical systems. This is part of a program to extend the                      understanding of rational maps to more general maps in the                      complex plane. He will continue to study the Julia sets of                      selected one-parameter families of mappings. These form                         theboundaries between points with unbounded iterates and those                  which remain in some fixed region. His innovative use of movies                 in these studies has been very instructive in our understanding                 of the dynamics of entire functions, and now seems likely to bear               fruit in his investigations of non-analytic dynamics. Devaney                   will also turn his attention to the bifurcation diagrams of these               families.                                                                           In the realm of analytic dynamics Devaney will work to                      understand the local dynamics of entire maps near an essential                  singularity. This is important since one of the distinguishing                  features of entire functions is the presence of an essential                    singularity at infinity. In order to extend earlier work to the                 non-analytic setting he will study non-rational meromorphic                     functions. There appear to be new dynamical phenomena displayed                 by the Julia sets of these functions. A final topic for                         investigation will be the bifurcation structure of the area                     preserving Henon maps.",
