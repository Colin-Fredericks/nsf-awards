 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Robert Gordon, University of Illinois at Chicago, is                  supported by a grant from The Physical Chemistry Program to                     perform experimental tests of reaction rate theories.  Dr.                      Gordon is making use of current state-of-the-art molecular beam                 techniques to study reactions between very simple molecules at                  the most fundamental level.  The results gleaned from these                     experiments should provide valuable tests of prevailing                         theories of chemical reactions at the molecular level.                                                                                                          Two extreme mass combinations will be studied in order to                       reveal unusual dynamic effects and to test theoretical                          predictions.  In one case the transfer of a light atom                          (hydrogen) between two heavy partners (chlorine 35 and chlorine                 37) will be studied, and in the other case the exchange of two                  light partners (hydrogen and deuterium) in hydrogen chloride                    will be investigated.  Specific questions to be addressed                       include: the validity of the transition state theory for                        treating these reactions; the contribution of tunneling to the                  reaction rate; the structure in the energy dependence of the                    reaction cross section; the effects of the attractive and                       repulsive features of the potential energy surface.",
