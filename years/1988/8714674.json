 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates linear and nonlinear features of                westward traveling tropospheric planetary-scale waves, including                those variable in both amplitude and phase.  Studies will                       include wave forcing and decay, response in a single hemisphere                 (especially with respect to season), nonlinear interactions                     including chaos, and correlation with sudden stratospheric                      warmings at times of especially prominent wave activity.                             For example, the PI will diagnose wave forcing during 1976-                1986, with special emphasis on January 1979, when an extremely                  prominent wavenumber one was present in only the Northern                       Hemisphere and April 1980, when the same candidate wave was                     observed with equal amplitude in both hemispheres.                                   Prior to now, researchers have explained the excitation of                 normal modes as being due to stochastic forcing without being                   more specific.  This approach will enable the calculation of                    forcing from observations both directly and as a residual.  With                this knowledge, forcing can be mapped in space and analyzed in                  time.  Another possibility which will be examined is whether the                assumed stochastic behavior may in fact be \"chaotic,\" i.e.                      deterministic but seemingly random through nonlinearity.                             This research is important because it attempts to understand               the dynamical processes responsible for large-scale atmospheric                 variability on intra-and interseasonal time scales.",
