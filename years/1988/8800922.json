 "awd_abstract_narration": "There has recently been considerable controversy over the                  ability of terrestrial plants to \"compensate\" for herbivore                     damage.  If plants can effectively compensate for the tissue                    removal caused by herbivores, damage should have little influence               on the population dynamics of plant species.  Although several                  studies have looked at the influence of herbivory on semelparous                (Flower only once) plants, little research has addressed the                    impact of herbivores on the lifetime offspring production of                    iteroparous (Flowering every year) species.  An experiment will                 be performed in the Wrangell Mountains of Alaska examining the                  influence of chronic lepidopteran (Tortricidae) feeding on the                  growth, seed production, and seedling quality of dwarf fireweed,                Epilobium latifolium, a long-lived herbaceous perennial.  Plants                will be subjected to three intensities of artificial damage over                three years, giving data to construct probability transition                    matrices for growth and seed output.  These models can then be                  used to estimate the influence of different frequencies and                     intensities of herbivory on plant performance over the thirty to                forty year life-span of fireweed.  An experiment in which                       compensatory regrowth following damage is controlled, in order to               estimate the importance of regrowth in mitigating the impact of                 herbivory will be performed.  This work will give one of the few                estimates of the life-time impacts of herbivory on an iteroparous               plant species.",
