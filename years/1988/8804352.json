 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cambro-Ordovician conodonts are abundant and the same species are               more widely distributed than other contemporaneous fossil groups.               Because of their utility they will be the primary group utilized                for choice of a boundary point by the International Working Group               on the Cambrian-Ordovician Boundary.  The project will fund the                 PI's continuing work as Secretary of this committee.  Other                     aspects of the project are study of Cambro-Ordovician eustatic                  sea-level fluctuations.  Strata in Nevada deposited during these                sea-level changes will be studied in cooperation with U.S.                      Geological Survey personnel who have studied the Nevada strata and              equivalent beds in Kazakhstan.  The goal of this part of the                    research is to correlate unusual sedimentation patterns in                      platform and continental-slope deposits in these areas.  A final                aspect of the study is continuation of a project on                             biostratigraphy and paleoecology of Cambro-Ordovician conodonts in              western Utah.  Facies changes in the area make it a natural                     laboratory for study of the Cambro-Ordovician conodont                          paleoecology and the influence of facies changes on conodont                    biostratigraphy.  Some of these facies changes are related to the               eustatic fluctuations discussed above and can be correlated with                data on sedimentation patterns in Nevada, Kazakhstan, and other                 areas to form an integrated picture of the effects of these                     eustatic events.  These events are related to faunal extinctions                and evolutionary changes which must be understood before a                      Cambrian-Ordovician boundary point can be chosen wisely.",
