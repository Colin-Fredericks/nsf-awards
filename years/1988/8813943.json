 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research utilizes three different, but complementary,                 approaches to extend the understanding of standardization                       processes and outcomes: theoretical modelling, case studies, and                cross-sectional data analysis. The theoretical projects are: (1)                An examination of the effect of translator devices or \"gateway\"                 technologies on standardization. This work examines the extent to               which translators can ameliorate inefficiencies in the                          standardization process, as well as whether translators might give              rise to new problems. (2) An analysis of the efficiency of the                  timing of de facto standardization by the \"market\".  (3) An                     investigation of conflict resolution and information sharing                    within voluntary standards committees. The case studies will focus              on the role of dominant firms in standard setting, the role of                  committees in conflict resolution versus coordination, and the                  timing of adoption.  Five case studies are undertaken, mostly                   drawn from the information processing industries. The econometric               projects include the measurement of benefits arising from the                   dramatic standardization of railroad gauges in the U.S. in 1885,                and the measurement of network externalities for VCR's by                       collecting data on adoption rates in small U.S. towns.***",
