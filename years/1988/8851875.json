 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides five physiological recording instruments for         120 students per semester in six laboratory sections of a course in             physiological psychology. The study of the physiological bases of               behavior requires accurate monitoring and recording of physiological            responses. The equipment provided for this project allows the upper             division undergraduate students to gain the necessary hands on                  experience if they are to grasp the relationship between biology and            behavior and to understand the techniques by which these relationships          are discovered. When not needed for the physiological psychology                classes, the equipment is employed in demonstrations in the                     introductory psychology classes and research methods classes. In                addition, The equipment significantly increases the quantity and                quality of independent research projects carried out by undergraduate           students doing research in physiological psychology. The award will be          matched by an equal amount from the grantee.",
