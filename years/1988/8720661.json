 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project undertakes to produce the first neo-classical                      economic history of seventeenth-century Russia.  It also is the                 first Russian economic history to study closely the link of                     society and the legal structure of the economy.  Russia was                     primarily an oral society well into the sixteenth century.                      Massive destruction of those documents which were created has                   made detailed study of Russian history prior to 1611 (the \"Great                Fire of Moscow\") difficult.  Previous neo-classical attempts at                 Russian economic history began no earlier than l700, the reign of               Peter the Great, as summarized in Arcadius Kahan's work on the                  eighteenth-century Russian economy.  This study is based in part                on the gathering and analysis of 15,000 prices and wages in the                 social context of their transactors.  More than 1200 different                  commodities are in the study.  Price indices show that the price                level was falling for the majority of commodities.  This was                    especially true for imported goods and substitutes manufactured                 in Russia, a process that began in the 1630s and accelerated in                 the 1650s as Russia became increasingly integrated into the                     European market.  The result was a rise of real incomes.                                                                                                        The picture of a non-stagnant economic structure that emerges                   from the data belies the traditional nature of 17th century                     Russian society and the relatively unfavorable legal climate that               prevailed.  The study seeks to analyze the mainsprings of                       development that were at work and to delineate and better                       understand the shifting balance between stagnation and change.",
