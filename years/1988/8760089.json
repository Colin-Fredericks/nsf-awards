 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to develop a capability for:               (1) calculating two-dimensional optical diffractions for the                    edges of dielectric or imperfectly conducting features on                       layered, silicon-based substrates; and (2) utilizing diffracted                 two-dimensional fields in an inversion algorithm for shape                      reconstruction of linear (line-like) features on silicon wafers                 and chips for integrated circuits.  The research is fundamentally               mathematical in nature and is driven by critical problems in the                integrated circuit industry, although it is important to a wider                class of applications.                                                               The research objective for Phase I is:  (1) to implement a                 new theory of vector diffraction utilizing self-similarity and                  vector boundary value problems in complex variable theory; and                  (2) to begin preliminary study of the inverse optical scattering                problem for metrology of edged features on silicon substrates,                  considering the pros and cons of time domain and frequency domain               data, and feasibility of data acquisition.                                           If successful, these diffraction solutions and inversion                   methods will prove technically beneficial for a variety of                      applied problems.  However, their greatest potential may                        eventually be reached in the integrated circuit industry if they                can contribute to increased yield by means of automated                         metrology.                                                                           It is expected that positive results from this line of                     research could eventually contribute to the theory of a                         practical, automated inspection instrument for IC metrology.                    This would have a significant impact on productivity of the                     integrated circuit industry.  The vector diffraction solutions                  sought here are useful in their own right for sonar, radar, and                 optics applications.",
