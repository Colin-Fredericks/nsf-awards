 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funding to deploy 7 temporary broadband                seismograph stations in a north-south profile at a longitude of                 about 123oW in western Washington for the purpose of recording                  teleseismic body waveforms.  We intend to undertake a receiver                  function analysis of the recorded P-waves in order to delineate                 variations in the amplitude and timing of Ps conversions from the               oceanic Moho of the subducted Juan de Fuca plate that are                       indicative of variations in the geometry of the subducted slab                  along its strike.  Specifically, we will attempt to confirm and                 refine a working hypothesis recently proposed that suggests that                the Juan de Fuca plate may be deformed in a broad arch centered in              the vicinity of Puget Sound.  This model explains certain aspects               of the seismicity beneath this region as well as a number of other              geological and geophysical observations.  We have recorded                      teleseismic P-waveforms along an east-west profile at about 47oN                latitude that demonstrates that the oceanic Moho of the                         Juan de Fuca plate has a characteristic signature in teleseismic                receiver functions.  Results from these earlier deployments are                 consistent with our arch model.  Further refinements in this model              will have important implications in terms of the tectonic                       evolution and earthquake hazards potential of the Cascadia                      Subduction Zone.                                                                                                                                                     This research represents a collaborative project between the               University of Missouri-Columbia (T.J. Owens) and the University of              Washington (R.S. Crosson).",
