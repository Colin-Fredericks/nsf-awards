 "awd_abstract_narration": "A High-Field Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer          System including variable temperature, hard disk, and coprocessor               accessories is being used to introduce new experiments in the Physical,         Inorganic, Advanced Analytical, and Introductory Organic Chemistry              Laboratory Courses.  The scientific productivity of the undergraduate           research program is being substantially increased.  Examples of student         research projects which are being made possible by this instrument              included:  (I) studies of the stereochemistry of augmented thermal and          photochemical Cope rearrangements; (II) synthesis and studies of the            regio- and stereochemistry of dealkoxycarbonylation reactions of                thienyl substituted polyalkoxycarbonyl ethenes as possible polythienyl          precursors; (III) synthesis and conformational studies of Schiff base           coordination compounds as possible laser materials; and (IV) the                synthesis of silicone compounds of theoretical interest.
