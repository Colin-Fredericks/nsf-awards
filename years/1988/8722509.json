 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Drs. Thomas              K. Gaisser and Todor Stanev, Bartol Research Institute and Dr. A.M.             Hillas, University of Leeds, U.K.  Drs. Gaisser and Stanev will                 travel to Leeds to work on a data analysis of the South Pole Air                Shower Experiment (SPASE), which is an ongoing joint experiment of              the two institutions.  The purpose of the experiment is to inspect              the arrival direction of detected air showers and to search for                 point sources of ultra-high energy gamma-rays.  The search for                  extraterrestrial sources of ultra-high energy gamma-rays is an                  extremely interesting astrophysical problem, related to the                     acceleration of the cosmic rays in the Galaxy and to processes and              models of X-ray binary systems.  The South Pole location provides a             unique opportunity for uninterrupted observations of the southern               sky, which is expected to be rich in sources.  In addition, SPASE is            ideally situated to look for ultra-high energy gamma-rays from the              new Supernova, SN 1987a.  The discovery of such a signal would be of            great importance for understanding acceleration processes and                   evolution of young supernovae.                                                                                                                                  The detector that will be used for the experiment is very similar to            the array now deployed by the Leeds group in England to look for                signals from Northern Hemisphere sources.  Close coordination of                data acquisition and comparison of two independent analyses of the              data are essential for success of the experiment.  This research                brings together three of the leading experts in the analysis of air             shower experiments.",
