 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to test the idea that the break-up                      unconformity may, in some cases, be associated with variation in                in-plane stress within the lithosphere.  The area chosen for                    study is the Aptian break-up unconformity of the Grand Banks of                 Eastern Canada because in this setting the PIs expect a                         significant likelihood of detection.  They ask whether the                      proposed mechanism is necessary to explain the observed                         stratigraphic relationships and whether the mechanism is                        sufficient for plausible assumptions regarding lithospheric                     properties and magnitudes of the in-plane stress. The proposed                  study includes analysis of the seismic and stratigraphic data                   from the region as well as the development of three dimensional                 lithospheric deflection models.  The data analysis will be done                 in conjunction with personnel from Petro-Canada Resources.                      %%%                                                                                     The concepts of seismic stratigraphy and sequence                       stratigraphy, that is, stratigraphic sequences that can be                      attributed to the fluctuations in sea level over geologic time,                 have come to the forefront of geological thinking.  It is not yet               clear whether the sequences are strictly due to actual sea level                fluctuations or whether they may be due in part to tectonic                     effects.  This project will help sort this matter out.",
