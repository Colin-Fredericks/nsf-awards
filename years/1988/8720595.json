 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the Vulsini Volcanic complex in central Italy, mafic and                     felsic magmas have erupted with varying degrees of mixing.                      Despite the predominance of tephra in the Vulsini area, models of               magmatic evolution at this center have been based almost entirely               upon compositional variations among lava flows, and such sampling               cannot avoid bias.  Pumice clasts in tephra provide more                        representative samples of move voluminous magmas at the instant                 of eruptive fragmentation, and more adequately reflect the                      petrogenetically significant crustal components that are likely                 to be greatly undersampled if felsic tephra are ignored.  This is               an ongoing effort whose aim is to provide a petrogenetic model                  based on microprobe, major and trace element and isotopic                       analyses of crystals and glasses in an extensive suite of fresh                 pumice clasts from carefully studied pyroclastic units.  This                   award is specifically to provide 60 neutron activation analyses.                The results should advance understanding of the genesis of                      subsequent evolution of the mafic silica-undersaturated potassic                magmas and the silica-oversaturated magmas, the processes by                    which the two magma types mixed, and the mechanisms of eruption                 of the resulting broad compositional range of magmas.",
