 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biotechnology is now recognized as a new focus for industrial              growth.  There are four principal interacting phases upon which                 all material/biosystem compatibility is based - substrata/-                     macromolecular \"conditioning films\"/living cells/surrounding                    media.  A planning grant, NSF CDR 86-15640, has shown that an                   Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on Biological                   Surface Science is both feasible and viable.                                         This award is initiating an Industry/University Cooperative                Research Center on Biological Surface Science at the State                      University of New York - Buffalo in collaboration with Montana                  State University.  The initial research is being focussed around                model substrata of polymers, metals and ceramics which are being                used to study the deposits occurring during exposures to relevant               interacting biosystems.  Other studies are addressing biosystem                 compatibility with bacteria mamanalian cells blood components and               micro alage.                                                                         A woman undergraduate is augmenting the research through                   studies of model substrata.                                                          Eight companies are providing 60% of the Center's funding.                 Both the University and the New York State Science and Technology               Foundation are providing significant cost sharing for the Center's              total budget of over $600,000.                                                       The Co-Principal Investigators and their colleagues are                    nationally recognized experts in their fields and have the                      experience and industrial contacts to run an Industry/University                Cooperative Research Center.                                                         The Program Manager recommends the State University of New                 York - Buffalo (in collaboration with Montana State University) be              awarded $75,000 a year for a five year continuing grant.  An                    additional $5,000 is recommended for one (1) year for \"Funding for              Support of Women, Minority, and Disabled Engineering Research                   Assistants\" program.                                                                 Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager                  and/or the Director of The Division of Cross-Disciplinary Research              will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal                   criteria, including the following: (1) extent to which                          university/industry interaction and collaboration is developing;                (2) extent to which the support base for the center is expanding;               (3) extent to which a robust research program is developing.  If                review is satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support              of the next period of this continuing grant.",
