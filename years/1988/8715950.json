Becker of Southern Illinois University and                Professor Tatsuro Miwa of the University of Tsukuba, Japan to                   collaborate in a cross-cultural study of students' strategies and               difficulties in mathematical problem solving.  Researchers will                 videotape students in both countries as they solve selected                     non-routine problems with paper and pencil in an interview                      context.  The students' written work, interviewer/observer                      observations, and evaluation of the videotapes will provide data                for defining the degree of use and the roles of pattern-finding and             modelling in mathematical problem solving.                                                                                                                      The research to be carried out follows directly from the U.S.-Japan             Seminar on Mathematical Problem Solving held in July 1986 under the             auspices of the U.S.-Japan Cooperative Science Program.  Clarifying             strategies and difficulties of students in problem solving is                   indispensable in order to improve the teaching of mathematical                  problem solving.  The cross-cultural nature of this research will               be important in helping to define the various factors which                     influence a students' strategies and difficulties.",
