 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this project is to elucidate the                       biological roles and mechanism of action of a translational                     repressor protein that is encoded by the regA gene of                           bacteriophage T4 in infected Escherichia coli host.  The regA                   protein selectively inhibits translation of a subset of                         phage-induced mRNAs including its own message (autogenous                       translational repression).  In previous years we cloned the                     regA gene, overproduced its protein product, purified the                       protein, purified the protein, and characterized some of its                    activities in vivo and in vitro.  Some of our main results                      include: precise transcriptional mapping of the regA gene,                      localization of the target for autogenous control to the                        translation initiation region of the mRNA, localization of                      regA-protein-binding sites on several regA-regulated mRNAs,                     discovery of a role for regA protein in transcription                           termination downstream of the regA gene, and discovery of an                    mRNA structure that enhances translation.  In the work                          proposed here we will investigate the roles of nucleotide                       sequences in the leader segment of the mRNA for regA protein                    in control of synthesis of the protein.  Several mRNA target                    sites for regA protein binding (including the autogenous                        target) are being mapped precisely by the use of in vitro                       manipulations by which nucleotide replacements are made in                      specific sequences within the ribosome-binding domains of the                   regA regulated mRNAs.  The effects of these in vitro-                           generated mutations on sensitivity to regA protein are being                    assessed by in vivo and in vitro translation/repression                         assays.  In addition we are examining the role of regA                          protein in transcription termination at \"CUUCGG\" hairpin                        structures in intercistronic regions and attempting to                          identify the breakdown products of the mRNAs that the regA                      protein represses.  A pilot study is underway aimed at                          identifying proteins, nucleoproteins, and RNA species that                      interact with regA protein and influence its activity in                        vivo.                                                                                                                                                           The work in this proposal should provide us with deeper                         insights into the as yet poorly understood processes by which                   a cell controls and coordinates its overall rates of DNA,                       RNA, and protein synthesis.",
