 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I                          project is in the general area of physical organic                              chemistry and in the subfield of catalysis.  The goal of                        this research is to ascertain the feasibility of catalyzing                     a commercially important class of chemical reactions                            through the application of ultrasound.  Diels-Alder                             reactions represent a class of chemical processes that are                      synthetically quite useful but which have such inherently                       slow rates of reaction that they are of limited commercial                      utility.  Energy & Minerals Research Company will                               investigate whether the application of ultrasonic energy to                     Diels-Alder reaction mixtures will accelerate their rates                       of reaction sufficiently to enable their broader use in                         larger scale commercial synthetic chemistry.  Four                              different Diels-Alder systems, chosen to represent a broad                      range of reactivities, will be studied under identical                          conditions as a function of sonic intensity.                                                                                                                    This Phase I effort should determine whether the rates of a                     range of Diels-Alder reactions can be promoted                                  sonochemically.  Additionally, the electric power                               requirements to catalyze these reactions will be determined                     and the economic feasibility of the approach evaluated.                         The successful and economically feasible catalysis of                           Diels-Alder reactions by ultrasound would add                                   significantly to the synthetic capability of commercial                         synthetic chemistry.",
