 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will examine two aspects of reproductive control by               the environmental day-night cycle.  First, Stetson plans to                     examine the mechanisms by which two species of hamsters measure                 day length.  The primary focus will be the functional                           relationship between the environmental light cycle, the animal's                brain and its pineal gland.  This gland has been shown by many                  investigators, ourselves included, to translate neural signals                  designating day length into hormonal (melatonin) output.  The                   primary interest is an understanding of the means by which                      melatonin output is read by the hamster as a long day                           (stimulating reproduction) or a short day (inhibiting                           reproduction).  Second, Stetson plans to continue his examination               of the means by which pregnant hamsters transmit daylength                      information to their fetuses.  This information is used by the                  young, after birth, to regulate their response to daylengths of                 intermediate duration.  Again, the maternal pineal gland and its                hormone melatonin is involved in this process.  He plans to                     examine possible mechanisms that coordinate and regulated this                  information transfer process.",
