 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Committee on Radio Frequencies (CORF) was formed by the National            Academy of Sciences (NAS) in 1961, and it has been supported in some            form by the National Science Foundation (NSF) since 1963.  Committee            activities have predominantly involved radio astronomy issues.  In              1969, the Subcommittee on Space Science was added to the existing               Subcommittee on Radio Astronomy, and NASA began contributing                    approximately 25 percent of the support for CORF.  In 1987, the two             Subcommittees merged into one Committee on an experimental basis.                                                                                               The CORF is the nongovernmental focal point for radio frequency                 requirements for scientific research.  Over the years, the CORF has             played a leading role in representing the needs of the scientific               community in national and international spectrum management forums,             particularly during U.S. preparations for World Administrative Radio            Conferences.  The NAS has administered the CORF expertly for the past           26 years, and it is appropriate for that arrangement to continue.                                                                                               The CORF provides timely and authoritative advice and recommendations           to the NSF and other Government agencies on the use of the radio                spectrum for research purposes.  The NSF has a direct interest in the           activities of CORF and cooperates closely with the Committee through            the Electromagnetic Spectrum Management Unit.  Input from the CORF to           the NSF is of particular value since the NSF represents the research            use of the radio spectrum on the Interdepartment Radio Advisory                 Committee (IRAC) of the National Telecommunications and Information             Administration (NTIA).                                                                                                                                          CORF activities in the 1988-1991 time period will revolve around                domestic spectrum allocation activities, participation in the current           cycle of meetings of the International Radio Consultative Committee             (CCIR), preparations for a possible upcoming World Administrative Radio         Conference of the International Telecommunication Union and advice on           the implementation of the Final Acts of the 19897 Mobile World                  Administrative Radio Conference.                                                                                                                                The role CORF plays in national and international spectrum management           is becoming more important with the increasingly intense competition            for radio frequency spectrum.  Support for CORF for the period 1988-            1991 is highly recommended.  This recommendation for $67,000 covers the         NSF contribution to CORF support for the first year of a 3-year                 continuing grant.",
