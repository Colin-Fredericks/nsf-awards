 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Professor Jack T. Spence from Utah State                 University to collaborate with Dr. Anthony G. Wedd at LaTrobe                   University, Australia on a study of molybdenum containing enzymes.              Research will involve detailed spectroscopic analysis of electron               paramagnetic resonance (EPR), electrochemical investigations, and               theoretical calculations related to the molybdenum centers of these             enzymes, as well as the synthesis of analogues to these complexes.                                                                                              Although molybdenum containing enyzmes are involved in several                  important biological processes, their mode of action is not                     presently known.  The purpose of this research is to gain an                    understanding of these enzymes at the molecular level.  The research            will benefit from the complementary skills and instrumentation of               the research groups in the United States and Australia.  Dr.                    Spence's expertise is in electron theory and in ligand design and               synthesis.  Dr. Wedd will provide equipment and techniques which                permit detailed monitoring of electrochemical and EPR properties.",
