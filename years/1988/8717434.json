Andrews LTER site in Oregon.                Specifically, the research will focus on completing threeresearch                                                                                               tasks.  First, a two-year study of nutrient dynamics infour                     species of decaying logs will be finished.  Data on changesin                   nutrient content of the logs will be integrated withinformation                 on nutrient inputs through processes such as nitrogenfixation,                  and outputs through processes such as fragmentation andleaching.                                                                                                Second, logs set in the field 1985, will be studied todetermine                 nitrogen fixation, fungal community distribution andenzyme                      activity associated with the decomposer community.  Thiseffort                  will complete a study of seasonal patterns in log decay. And                    third, analyses of terpene and phenol content of the logs setout                in 1985, will be completed.  Some of these compounds arethought                 to serve as attractants for wood-boring insects and/or                          asinhibitors of decomposition.                                                                                                                                  The significance of this research is that it will help us                       tounderstand the role of log decay in nutrient cycling in                       forestecosystem.  In old-growth forests of the Pacific                          Northwest,downed logs and other woody debris comprise up to 22%                 of above-ground organic mass (live and dead organic matter) and                 81% ofaboveground detritus.  This large mass of dead woody                      material maywell serve as an important storehouse of nutrients                  and regulatorof nutrient dynamics in these forest systems.                                                                                                      Dr. Showalter and his colleagues have good records ofproductivity               in this research area.  The institutional supportavailable to                   them is superior.",
