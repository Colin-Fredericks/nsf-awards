 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research is directed at overcoming two of the major                    problems associated with the use of polymer concretes:  shrinkage               during curing which results in residual stresses, and creep                     during service, which leads to delayed failure under static                     loads.  The approach taken toward controlling curing shrinkage is               the introduction of a mineral phase which loses water and expands               during curing, thus offsetting the shrinkage associated with                    resin polymerization.  This effort will also include research                   into the substitution of other, lower boiling liquids for the                   hydration water in the mineral, to achieve greater effects at                   lower curing temperatures.  The creep problem is to be attacked                 by providing a detailed characterization of the creep behavior of               the material-i.e., through the provision of an accurate                         constitutive law for the material, and through 3-D finite element               analysis to elucidate the effects of various material                           modifications (aggregate size, shape, size distribution,                        inclusion of fibers, etc.) on the creep behavior, to provide a                  basis for optimization of polymer concretes for creep resistance.",
