 "awd_abstract_narration": "They will conduct an experimental and theoretical study of phase                diagrams of vicinal surfaces of Silicon and Germanium.  Recent                  developments in their laboratory imply that faceting associated                 with reconstructive phase transitions is a general property of                  vicinal surfaces.  This has profound implications for the                       stability of vicinal surfaces and hence for many advanced device                concepts.  Faceting associated with reconstruction can be related               to the formation of a sharp edge in the equilibrium crystal                     shape.  Using thermodynamic arguments they predict that this kind               of behavior is widespread on surfaces that undergo reconstructive               phase transitions.  They therefore plan to compare the phase                    diagrams of a number of vicinal Silicon and Germanium surfaces                  with phenomenological models of the free energy.  Universal                     features of the phase diagrams, such as critical exponents,                     impose strong restrictions on such models.  Nonuniversal aspects,               such as phase boundaries, can be used to set limits on                          microscopic interactions.  Simulations of the phase diagrams will               test existing models and serve as a guideline for the development               of more accurate descriptions.  The detailed phase diagrams                     needed for comparison with the theory will be obtained using                    their recently developed high-resolution LEED instrument.",
