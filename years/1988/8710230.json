 "awd_abstract_narration": "Until recently, legal and political theory has been                        dominated by the untested hypothesis that local government                      functions in a legal system crippled and frustrated by state and                federal limitations.  It has been asserted that the                             constitutional limitations historically imposed by state                        governments on the truncated and dependent local governments has                frustrated the proper and natural development of municipal                      government in the U.S. and accounts for a whole host of                         contemporary problems.  The fundamental power of American local                 government has been shaped by this \"strict\" construction of its                 power, a construction enforced through both state and federal                   court decisions down through the twentieth century.                                  Dr. Monkkonen is conducting a socio-legal historical                       analysis of the efforts of state government to control or limit                 the indebtedness of local governments in the nineteenth century.                His preliminary work at the state level indicates that there is                 no association between states that did and did not impose debt                  limits on the subsequent indebtedness of local governments.  He                 will now examine legal control of local politics beginning with                 the Illinois constitution of 1870 as the basis for investigation.               He will reanalyze data from a survey of 1200 local governments in               Illinois in 1870 together with the censuses of 1870 and 1880 to                 study the impact of the imposition of debt limits between these                 dates.  Local variations will be studied and extensive archival                 analyses in a subset of communities will be conducted to                        understand the political dynamics of variations.  Issues that                   will be explored in the analysis include the nature of corporate,               fiscal behavior, how government entrepreneurship was determined,                the relationship between levels of government and popular                       political action, and the success of regulatory laws.  Most                     importantly, the research takes an era of experimentation with                  local government entrepreneurship and examines whether externally               mandated regulations constrict emergent, local public/private                   capital development or whether municipal corporations (local                    governments) limit their own fiscal behavior, with the main                     restriction to local fiscal behavior coming from risk aversive                  voters more than from any external controls.                                         The Illinois survey and subsequent fiscal limitation                       activities represent a unique opportunity to examine the                        interactions between law, politics, and finance.  The building                  and behavior of the American \"state\" has become a priority agenda               for both theory and empirical research.  The empirical results of               this research will add new evidence that possibly the local                     state, not the national state, was the locus of American state                  building and provided a form of corporate entrepreneurship.",
