 "awd_abstract_narration": "Paramecia have been likened to swimming neurons and they                   serve as examples of receptor cells that are sensitive to                       exogenous chemical stimuli.  The PI has laid the ground work in                 the study of chemoreception in Paramecium to the point where                    there are putative chemoreceptor proteins identified for the                    stimuli folate and  cAMP.  A genetic approach has been used from                the very beginning of these studies of chemosensory transduction.               Mutants figured heavily from the theses studies to quantify the                 behavioral responses to stimuli, to describe the swimming                       mechanisms that led to attraction and repulsion, to identify and                characterize the membrane electrical responses that follow                      ligand-receptor binding and to describe the binding proteins                    including the chemoreceptors for two attractant stimuli.  The                   stage is now set for the PI to apply the techniques of molecular                genetics to the study of chemoreception.  The PI proposes to                    train herself in molecular genetics during a sabbatical year at                 USC.  The goal will be to clone the genes for the cAMP and                      possibly folate binding proteins that are candidates for                        chemoreceptors and to bring the technique of molecular genetics                 back to her laboratory at UVM.  The end result will be to apply                 powerful techniques to a problem ripe for them, to provide                      training in state-of-the-art techniques for the PI, and in                      general, to improve the future directions and productivity of the               PI's laboratory.",
