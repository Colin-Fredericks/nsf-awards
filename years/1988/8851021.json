 "awd_abstract_narration": "Six Indiana school districts, in partnership with industry,                     universities, libraries, data retrieval services, and a museum  will            develop and implement programs to give middle school students experience        in computer data processing and literature searching.  Through a summer         workshop teachers from the school district will work with industry and          university scientists to design scientific studies their students can           pursue, both by data-generating experiments and by literature searching.        Teachers, and in turn their students, will learn how to create data             bases for their own results and how to access and search commercial data        bases for complementary information.  During the summer workshop the            teachers will have an opportunity to test their programs on students in         a museum prior to taking these programs back to their own classrooms.           Materials and procedures developed during the project will be widely            disseminated.                                                                                                                                                   Cost sharing by the partners will total 17% of the NSF funding.",
