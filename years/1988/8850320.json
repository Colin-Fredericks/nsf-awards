 "awd_abstract_narration": "Women's Introduction to Engineering (WIE) was initiated in 1981 to              attract academically talented students to the field of engineering.             The program is designed to provide a comprehensive exploration of               career opportunities and a realistic introduction to engineering                education before career decisions are made.  Supporting objectives              include: a) to introduce participants to the academic demands of                college engineering study through direct experience; b)  to assist              students in planning preparatory coursework at the secondary level,             increasing their chances of admission and retention in college                  engineering programs; c) to enhance career planning skills and promote          consideration of non-traditional fields of study.  The geographic               target region includes the 32 southernmost counties in Illinois, a              rural area with 112 secondary schools and a median enrollment of 300.                                                                                           The 1988 summer program will be a two-week residential session for 15           students on the Southern Illinois University Carbondale campus,                 complemented by a research presentation follow-up activity and a                secondary educators'workshop.",
