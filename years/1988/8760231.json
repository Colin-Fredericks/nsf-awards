 "awd_abstract_narration": "A flow metering technique is proposed based on the                              hydrodynamic phenomenon of vortex formation in a flow cavity                    adjacent to a flow bend such as an elbow.  It has been                          discovered that when a circular cavity is provided at the                       outer side of the bend curvature of the flow bend, a vortex                     will be developed in the cavity and the strength of the                         vortex increases monotonically with the rate of the bend                        flow.  This suggests that the rate of the bend flow can be                      determined by the vortex motion in the cavity.  The vortex                      strength is determined by a free rotatable rotor in the                         cavity with its rotational axis coincident with the circular                    center of the cavity.  The rotor so installed turns with the                    vortex motion in the cavity and its rotational speed                            measures the vortex strength.  Thus, the bend flow can be                       determined by the induced rotor speed.  The proposed flow                       metering technique monitors a secondary flow to determine                       the main flow rate which is conceptually different from                         conventional flowmeters which measure directly the main flow                    and cause interference with the main flow field and normally                    a high pressure drop.  The advantage of the proposed                            technique is that the flow metering element causes little                       interference with the main flow field.  In fact, the                            preliminary test shows that the introduction of a cavity and                    a rotor to an elbow resulted in a more favorable flow condition                 and a pressure drop reduction from the original elbow.  This                    indicates that the proposed technique, when successfully                        developed, can measure flow without causing any additional                      pressure drop to the piping system or even a pressure drop                      reduction.",
