Increased antibody production has been                  reported for hybridomas exposed to environmental stress.  The                   objectives of this project are to characterize the mechanisms                   responsible for increased antibody production, and to identify                  reactor conditions with increased productivity.                                                                                                                 Concurrent changes in energy metabolism and DNA synthesis will be               monitored in order to determine the interrelationships between the              regulation of cell growth, energy production and protein                        expression.  An understanding of these relationships is required                in order to decouple cell growth from product formation.                        Excessive cell growth is not desired because expensive medium is                wasted on the production of biomass.  Reduced cell growth rates                 are also desirable because many primary, hybrid, and genetically-               altered cell lines decrease their rate of product formation after               repeated cell divisions.",
