 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the major issues in neuroscience is tying what we know                   about chemical messengers in the nervous system to actual                       behaviors.  This project combines the expertise of investigators                in the chemical and biological sciences to address the problem of               the relationship of neurotransmitter release and behavior. The                  most studied neurotransmitter in the central nervous system is                  dopamine.  Although the role that dopamine plays in behavior has                been the subject of intensive investigation, its specific role in               a number of behaviors is still not understood.  Part of the                     reason for the slow progress has been the absence of methods                    which allow observation of dopamine release during behavior.                    Drs. Joseph Justice and Darryl Neill have developed new                         techniques which will be utilized to monitor neurotransmitter                   release in behaving animals.  In particular the relationship of                 dopamine release and reward will be investigated, using                         intracranial self-stimulation, drug self-stimulation and food                   reward.  Behavioral studies have indicated a role of dopamine in                the reward of these three different stimuli.  Direct observation                of the neurochemical substrate thought to mediate these behaviors               will significantly enhance our understanding of dopamine release                and behavior.",
