 "awd_abstract_narration": "Target Science is a project designed to develop a replicable model for          revitalizing the teaching of K-12 science in highly impacted urban              schools.                                                                                                                                                        The goals of Target Science are to (1) provide replicable methods for           science teachers and their private sector, university, and community            partners to collaboratively identify needs for improving instructional          delivery, and then develop strategies that will successfully respond to         these needs, and (2) provide replicable methods to channel science-rich         community resources to science teachers in a manner that will facilitate        and stimulate positive and enduring change in the delivery of K-12              science instruction.                                                                                                                                            Target Science is designed to meet these goals by creating a model that         (1) builds an environment to nurture and stimulate change (K-12 Service         Dialogues, Science Forums, and Family Science Workshops), (2)                   establishes methods for improving science teacher knowledge bases and           instructional delivery techniques (Mini-grants, Science Center Grants,          Professional Development Grants, K-12 Science Workshops and IISME) and          (3) enhances communications in general and information exchange in              particular (TELEventure).                                                                                                                                       Cost sharing by the partners will total 738% of the NSF funding.",
