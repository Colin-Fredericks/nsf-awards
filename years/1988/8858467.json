 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to Dr. David B. Grusky under the National           Science Foundation's Presidential Young Investigator Awards program.            The objectives of this program are to provide research support to the           Nation's most outstanding and promising young science and engineering           faculty.  The awards are intended to improve the capability of U.S.             academic institutions to respond to the demand for highly qualified             science and engineering personnel for academic and industrial research          and teaching.  This award will allow the investigator to pursue his             research in the study of social stratification in the United States.            The objective of his work is to present a systematic history of the             rates, patterns, and sources of American social mobility over the last          150 years.  He will construct a standardized archive of comparable unit-        record data from a variety of contemporary and historical sources, and          will use these data to assess the effects of long-term economic and             institutional changes on the parameters of the mobility regime.  The            results will provide new evidence on the continuing debates over the            effects of economic growth and development on (a) the demographic               composition of social classes, (b) the opportunities for upward mobility        among blacks and other minorities, and (c) the structure of ethnic              differences in social stratification.",
