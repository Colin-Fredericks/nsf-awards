 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently the inelastic behavior of beam to column connections                   interacting with monolithically cast floor slabs has received a                 considerable attention.  In multistory reinforced concrete (RC) frame           buildings the poor performance of such connections caused by                    excessive damage during building deformations can adversely affect              the stiffness and strength of the entire structure.  A number of                beam-column-slab connections have been tested as isolated specimens             as well as within the RC test buildings.  The objective of the                  proposed research is to complement such studies by analyzing a number           of tested connections using the finite element method.  For this                purpose a 3-D material response model for simulating concrete                   behavior in the pre-cracked phase will be implemented.  This will be            augmented by a macroscopic (smeared) post-cracking constitutive model           for concrete which will simulate the cracked material behavior                  including the strain softening phenomenon as well as the interaction            between reinforcement and concrete.  A number of parametric and                 sensitivity studies  will be performed.  Such analysis will be                  carried out with the aim of broadening the understanding of the                 internal load-resisting mechanisms and ultimate capacities in RC                beam-column-slab connections.  The results of this investigation may            also produce  valuable information for future development of                    simplified models capable of simulating the dominant behavior                   characteristics while                                                           retaining simplicity and computational efficiency.",
