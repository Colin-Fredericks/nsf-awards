 "awd_abstract_narration": "Methods of evaluating structural reliability have advanced from                 member to system analysis.  A nonlinear structural analysis program             is utilized to derive ultimate  and serviceability limit states in              load space.  System probability of failure is computed by integration           of the joint density function of applied loads in the failure region            in a three-dimensional load space.  The reduction of load space                 dimensions to three is possible by assumption of positive perfect               correlation amongst certain floor loads.  Structural variability is             modeled by randomization of the                                                 limit state function in load space without requiring any additional             structural analysis.  Sensitivity of failure probability to load and            resistance variables are studied and factors with significant                   contributions are noted.  A systematic load space approach to design,           based on applying weights to modes of failure and minimization of the           total expected cost using single and multiobjective linear                      programming, is developed.  Results are trade-off curves between                future (or failure) cost and initial cost for several realistic                 structures.",
