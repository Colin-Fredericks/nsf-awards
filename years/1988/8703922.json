 "awd_abstract_narration": "This support is for an ecology workshop at the University of            Hawaii on tropical soil.  The theme for the workshop is \"Dynamics               of Soil Organic Matter in Tropical Ecosystems.\"  A panel of                     experts consisting of 25-30 scientists with interest in tropical                soils will be assembled for 5 days of discussions and field                     trips.  The objective is to provide an opportunity for U.S. and                 international scientists to assess the state-of-the-art research                on tropical soil organic matter, to identify research needs to                  refine procedures for the study of dynamic processes involved in                organic matter turnover, and to develop protocols for                           international, collaborative research efforts.  The outputs will                be a workshop proceedings and a state-of-the-art monograph.                             NSF will be the primary sponsor of this workshop.  However,             several projects supported by the Renewable Natural Resources                   Division of the Bureau for Science & Technology, U.S. Agency for                International Development, have expressed a keen interest in                    participating in this event and co-sponsoring the workshop by                   bringing to the workshop key experts in the subject area and                    supporting participants from developing countries.  These                       projects are: NifTAL (Nitrogen Fixation in Tropical Agricultural                Legumes), IBSNAT (International Benchmark Sites Network for                     Agrotechnology Transfer), SMSS (Soil Management Support                         Services), TropSoils (a name mark for Soil Management                           Collaborative Research Support Program), and TSMM (Technology of                Soil Moisture Management).                                                              This cooperation will help to produce a truly international             book from the workshop, which will be scheduled in summer or                    fall, 1988.",
