 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting                  this project which deals with the development of novel sulfur-                  and phosphorus-containing reagents to be used to prepare a                      variety of naturally occurring compounds of biological                          importance.  These reagents are designed to carry out a wide                    variety of important organic reactions, many of them with an                    unusually high degree of stereospecificity.                                                                                                                     The enantioselective formation of carbon-carbon bond is                         extremely important in the synthesis of chiral organic                          molecules.  Recently, this research group has developed a                       general and facile process for annulation which allows the                      preparation of these ring compounds in high to excellent                        optical purities, i.e. 1,4 gamma-addition of chiral                             sulfinylallyl anions to cyclic enones provided 70-97% ee, and                   chiral allylphosphonyl anions provided 88-98% ee.  Studies of                   the general scope, mechanism and versatility of these                           stereospecific 1,4-addition reactions of chiral sulfinyl- and                   phosphonylallyl anions will provide better understanding of the                 structures of the anions and further information on their                       utility in organic synthesis.  Enantioselective total syntheses                 of antitumor agents, trichothecenes, indolizidine alkaloids,                    and many other diterpenoids will be realized by utilizing these                 methods.",
