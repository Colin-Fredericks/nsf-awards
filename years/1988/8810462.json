 "awd_abstract_narration": "The flux of ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B, 280-320 nm) at sea level in          the Antarctic may be increasing due to decreases in  stratospheric ozone        levels.  Previous studies have shown that marine phytoplankton in the           upper portion of the water column are inhibited by natural UV radiation,        and hence further progressive increases in the flux of UV may have              damaging effects on the food web in Antarctic waters.  Holm-Hansen              proposes to measure the flux of natural UV in the euphotic zone with a          multi-channel spectral radiometer and document its effect(s) on marine          phytoplankton.  Analysis of absorption by particulate and dissolved             components will enable assessment of the role of phytoplankton and              detrital pigments in the attenuation of UV radiation.  Marine in situ           studies will examine both short-term effects of UV based on rates of            radiocarbon incorporation and long-term effects based on phytoplankton          growth rates.  In addition to marine in situ studies, controlled                experiments using artificial light sources will be conducted to evaluate        the effect of known UV doses on isolated phytoplankton cultures as well         as the differential sensitivities of species in natural water samples.          Photoadaptational responses involving synthesis of UV absorbing pigments        and their role in protection and/or photosynthesis will be analyzed             using HPLC, and particulate absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy.           These studies of the dynamic response of phytoplankton to increasing            dose-levels of UV will be important for understanding the biological            consequences of reduced ozone/enhanced UV-B levels in the Antarctic and,        through modeling efforts, will be of value in predicting UV effects             elsewhere in the world's oceans.",
