 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with the preordering of reactant                     groups in photoreactive polymer matrices.  Electron donor-                      acceptor interactions will be used as the ordering principle in                 these systems and to choose poly(vinylcinnamate) as the basic                   polymeric structure of the study.  Electron donor- and electron                 acceptor-substituted poly(vinylcinnamates) and some other                       derivatives will be prepared and their effect on photoreactivity                will be observed.  It is hoped that these chemical interactions                 will not only promote group association, but also lead to a                     pairing of the reaction centers of the photoreactive chromophores               and, hence, to an effective increase in photoreactivity.                                                                                                        The idea of group preordering is interesting not only for the                   design of crosslinkable polymers, as in photolithography, but                   also in new pathways; for the transport of photonic excitation,                 for the conduction of charge, and for the progression of chemical               reaction chains throughout a solid polymer matrix.                                                                                                              This research is being jointly funded with the Office of Naval                  Research.",
