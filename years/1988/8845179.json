 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several methods for site-specific mutagenesis have been                    developed that have aided in the recovery of altered genes                      carried on small circular DNA molecules.  The characterization                  of these mutations and the identification of their mutant                       phenotype affords a means for studying gene products.  By                       introducing mutations and correlating them with alterations in                  gene function, it has been possible to define transcriptional                   promotors, RNA splicing and polyadenylation sequences, ribosome                 binding sites, and polypeptide domains needed for enzymatic                     activities.  This laboratory has long been involved in projects                 that involve the synthesis of RNA by QB replicase from                          templates which have been altered in their nucleatide sequence.                 Now a small DNA plasmid has been developed that expresses                       significant quantities of the replicase subunits and a second                   plasmid that allows assay of replicase activity through                         synthesis of a suppressor tRNAs.  By generating a large number                  of mutants in the phage coded subunit of RNA replicase one will                 be albe to determine the precise structural requirements for                    replicase activity.  Dr. Mills has worked with this enzymne for                 twenty years and is now in the enviable position of using in                    vitro genetics for a structure-function analysis of this                        protein.  Over the years he has made many significant                           contributions.  Support is strongly recommended.",
