The Committee will produce a report               in 1989, which will contain: an updated plan for the orderly                    replacement and improvement of the research fleet; an analyses of               future science requirements for research vessels (R/V's);  plans                for upgrading existing ships; some alternative ship designs; and                advanced designs for two large R/Vs.  The ocean sciences                        community will be extensively involved throughout the committees'               deliberations.                                                                                                                                                  The Project Director, Dr. Worth D. Nowlin, Distinguished                        Professor, TAMU, is chairman of the Committee.  He is a highly                  respected member of the community and is quite capable of                       directing this project having had considerable experience in                    overseeing similar activities.                                                                                                                                  This project will provide valuable information and guidance to                  the NSF, other federal agencies and the ocean science community.                Partial support is being supplied by the Office of Naval                        Research.",
