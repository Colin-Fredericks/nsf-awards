 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the research is the detailed understanding                of corrosion processes in refractory metals, light alloys and                   high temperature alloys.  Three particular materials are proposed               for investigation, typical of these three important classes of                  materials.  The approach taken is that of detailed                              microstructural analysis of the chemistry and microstructure of                 the corrosion products, and of the near surface region of the                   material, using sophisticated methods of TEM (transmission                      electron microscopy) and AEM (analytical electron microscopy),                  combined with methods which permit precise tracking of the rates                of corrosion in the metals.                                                          Both the research and the development of analytical tools                  required for the research will be of significant benefit to both                science and technology, since corrosion of these materials is                   typically one of the limiting factors in their lifetime in                      service, and in their range of application.  Corrosion processes                tend to be complicated and path-dependent, and post-hoc analysis                typically gives little information about the details of the                     corrosion process.  The work would conversely make a significant                contribution to understanding the details of the corrosion                      process, and thereby lead to improved materials.",
