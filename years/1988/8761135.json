 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current research in robotic vision is focused mainly on the                     recognition of two dimensional patterns.  In many applications,                 however, depth perception capability is an essential feature.  In               principle, depth perception can be deduced from stereoscopic vision or          from holographic reconstruction, but the algorithm required to                  interpret the information is extremely complicated and requires                 substantial computation.  This research proposes the development of a           much simpler method of ranging based on the observation that the                relative position of the peaks of a diffraction pattern due to a point          source observed through a grating are found to shift as the distance            between the point source and grating is changed.  This phenomena has            been observed at visual frequencies and should be scalable to                   microwave frequencies.  Using millimeter waves, an instrument should            have a range of sensitivity from about 1 to 1000 meters.  The proposed          research sill carry out detailed experiments at optical and microwave           frequencies as a basis for developing such a ranging instrument.",
