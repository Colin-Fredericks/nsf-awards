 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flowering plant species exhibit a great deal of variation in               their mating systems.  One of the dominant paradigms currently                  used to describe plant mating systems is the mixed-mating model.                Perfect flowered plants are understood to reproduce through some                combination of self and outcross pollinations.  The proportion of               seeds produced by outcrossing events, or outcrossing rate, can                  vary between 0 and 1.  While empirical investigations have                      identified natural plant populations representing the full range                of potential outcrossing rates, theoretical predictions suggest                 that natural selection should act on intermediate outcrossing                   rates to produce either extreme of complete outcrossing or                      complete selfing.  There is currently no empirical evidence of                  the forces of natural selection acting upon intermediate                        outcrossing rates with which to test these theoretical                          predictions.                                                                         The proposed research will address the evolutionary dynamics               of intermediate outcrossing rates in a natural population of the                annual California lupine, Lupinus nanus.  Estimates of                          outcrossing rates have been made for populations throughout the                 species' range, and demonstrate a great deal of variation between               populations, with most of the populations outcrossing at                        intermediate rates.  Morphological variation between populations                has been suggested as an important determinant of the variable                  outcrossing rates.  Outcrossing rate variation had also been                    reported for the same population between years, and for                         individuals within a population.                                                     The proposed research will focus on mating system variation                within a population.  Individual plants will be measured for                    morphological, phenological and ecological characters.  Naturally               pollinated seed will be collected from these plants, and the                    outcrossing rate for individuals will be determined using genetic               information gathered from the use of starch-gel electrophorsis.                 In addition, artificial self and outcross pollinations will be                  performed and the seed will be used to assess the relative                      success of selfed and outcrossed offspring.  With this                          information, the effect of selection on the outcrossing rate can                be determined.  In addition to providing empirical evidence for                 testing the theoretical expectations concerning mating system                   evolution, this study will also provide information of general                  value of plant breeders.",
