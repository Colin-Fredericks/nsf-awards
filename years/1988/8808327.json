 "awd_abstract_narration": "A two-week institute in parallel computing was held in summer                   1988.  The objective was to give approximately 25 graduate and                  post-doctoral researchers a fundamental understanding of parallel               computing.  It comprised a series of lectures on topics including               parallel architectures for scientific computation, software tools               to aid in implementing parallel algorithms, use of graphics                     representations in the construction of parallel programs, and                   vectorization.  Participants experimented with test problems and                with a specific application that they brought with them to the                  institute.  Time was provided on the four multiprocessors in                    Argonne's Advanced Computing Research Facility.  Some class time                was spent reviewing UNIX and discussing the communications                      facilities available for local and remote access to these                       machines.                                                                                                                                                       The institute provided an opportunity for university researchers                to acquire knowledge and experience in the area of parallel                     computing.",
