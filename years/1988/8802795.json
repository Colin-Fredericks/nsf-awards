 "awd_abstract_narration": "There have been several recent theoretical and empirical                   studies of competition between annual plants.  Despite these                    efforts, many empiricists and theoreticians agree that there is                 little understanding of the impact of spatial heterogeneity on                  competitive interactions between plants.  This is disturbing                    given the patchy nature of plant distributions and the ability of               patchiness and dispersal to markedly alter competitive                          relationships in simple discrete models.  The following are                     lacking: 1) experiments in which the spatial distrubutions of                   inter- and intraspecific competitors are manipulated; 2)                        experiments in which the consequences of dispersal (which alters                these distributions) are investigated; and, 3) a theoretical                    framework for investigating competitive interactions between                    species with nonrandom spatial patterns.  This project will                     investigate how spatial distributions and seed dispersal                        influence the dynamics of competing populations of Poa annua and                Senecia vulgaris.  A series of single generation competition                    experiments in which spatial distribution is manipulated under                  controlled conditions will be performed.  Also the effects of                   dispersal will be incorporated by performing field experiments in               which spatial distributions and dispersal are minipulated over                  many generations.  Parallel with these experiments a model to                   explore more general questions about how dispersal and spatial                  patterns interact to determine plant population dynamics.",
