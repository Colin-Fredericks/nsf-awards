 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cedar Point Biological Station is a significant protected                  natural area which supports high quality research on grassland                  ecosystems.  A key resource associated with Cedar Point is                      Arapaho Prairie, a controlled access, regulated research site in                the unique Nebraska Sandhills ecosystem.  Arapaho Prairie is                    owned by the Nature Conservancy and managed through a long-term                 lease agreement by Cedar Point Biological Station to provide                    logistical support for manipulative research.                                        Two key facilities will be constructed with funds received                 from the present project.  These will greatly facilitate accurate               and effective site management and database                                      development/maintenance as well as support and encourage highly                 productive research enterprises into the dynamics of grassland                  processes.  Facilities to be constructed include: (1) a small                   preparatory building to provide protected, on-site workspace to                 support fieldwork.  Sophisticated electronic and physiological                  equipment required by many studies can be more effectively                      employed with the availability of such a facility.  (2) Arapaho                 Prairie will be gridded with permanent reference points and key                 biotic and abiotic features mapped.  These features will then be                synthesized in a Geographic Information System (GIS) which                      provides a computerized method for storing and referencing                      spatial relationships among these key attributes.  Future                       retrieval of known patterns as well as detection of presently                   unrecognized patterns for a variety of central, biologically                    relevant features of the site will then be possible.  The                       construction of this GIS will prove immediately valuable for                    preserving, mananging, providing access to, and fostering                       research at this nationally important research site.",
