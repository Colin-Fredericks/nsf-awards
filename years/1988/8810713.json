 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Shimony is investigating modifications of the time-                   dependent Schrodinger equation, which is the equation governing                 standard quantum dynamics.   He will pay some attention to                      nonlinear modifications of the Schrodinger equation and to the                  bearing of previous experiments upon their viability.  Most of                  his attention, however, will be devoted to stochastic                           modifications of the equation.  These have the virtue that in a                 finite time all but one component in a superposition of distinct                eigenstates of the apparatus variable can be extinguished, thus                 yielding a definite measurement result by a physical process.  In               this way, the notorious measurement problem of quantum mechanics                (which is a special case of the problem of the actualization of                 potentialities) would be solved physically rather than                          epistemologically.  At present the best explored stochastic                     modifications of the Schrodinger equation is that of Ghiardi,                   Rimini, and Weber, but the project aims at important improvements               of their theory:  freedom from the position representation,                     relativistic invariance, and reduction of the wave packet at an                 early state of interaction with the apparatus.  This work is part               of Professor Shimony's larger project of investigating the                      foundations of quantum mechanics.",
