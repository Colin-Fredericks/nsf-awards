 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of our studies is to determine the features of amino                   acid biosynthesis unique to plants using Arabidopsis                            thaliana.  We propose a molecular genetic approach to the                       dissection of the tryptophan pathway by isolating tryptophan-                   requiring mutants.  This pathway is of particular importance                    in plants because of its role in the biosynthesis of auxin,                     flavanoids, lignin precursor and other phenolic compounds.                      The fluorescence of one of the mutants we have already                          isolated will be used as a genetic marker to obtain more Trp                    mutants and to understand the relationship of tryptophan                        biosynthesis to the production of the hormone IAA.  As a                        complementary approach, we will clone the genes encoding the                    tryptophan biosynthetic enzymes.  The complete sequence of                      one of these genes, the tryptophan synthetase, which has                        already been cloned will be determined.  The cloned genes                       used as probes will reveal mechanisms of regulation, hormonal                   control, and intracellular localization.  Our analysis of                       the glutamate synthase (GOGAT) should provide key information                   about the relationship between amino acid metabolism and                        photosynthesis.  Our analysis of the HMG CoA reductase should                   also provide important insights concerning the aspects of                       steroid biosynthesis that are novel to plants.  With the                        cloned reductase gene as a probe we will able to determine                      the effects of hormones (gibberilins and abcissic acid) on                      the regulation of this enzyme.                                                                                                                                  The isolation of a tryptophan auxotroph of Arabidopsis                          thaliana was of the first demonstrations of amino acid                          auxotrophy in plants.  Such a breakthrough opens up an area                     of inquiry into plant gene regulation and metabolism which                      has not been previously possible.",
