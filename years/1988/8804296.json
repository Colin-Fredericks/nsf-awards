 "awd_abstract_narration": "Strong motion records from several reinforced concrete structures were          recovered after the 1987 Whittier, California earthquake.  Most of              these records showed significant amplification of the acceleration              with height.  Some of the records come from buildings that were either          rebuilt or seismically strengthened following the 1971 San Fernando             earthquake.  This study will review the available data from reinforced          concrete buildings, to select representative buildings, and to analyze          these buildings using available computer codes for the nonlinear                analysis of reinforced concrete structures.  By comparing the results           of the computer analysis to the available data, conclusions will be             drawn regarding the applicability and validity of available analytical          models, the amplification of earthquake motion as related to building           type and height, and the effectiveness of seismic strengthening.                                                                                                This study would provide a valuable evaluation of current analytical            models and seismic strengthening techniques for reinforced concrete             buildings.",
