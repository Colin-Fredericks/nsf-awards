 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposed is research on the processing of powder materials                 by high-pressure shock compression.  Exothermic chemical                        reactions to aid sintering are induced in a powder mixture by                   shock wave pulses passing through the mixture.  This process is                 applied to several metallic systems including those where efforts               on powder consolidation have proven to be difficult.                            Intermetallic alloys such as titanium aluminide and nickel-                     aluminide are explored to determine the effects of this type of                 processing on their properties.  The feasibility of scaling up                  these shock-induced reactions for engineering applications is                   part of the program.  The ultimate aim is to model the                          consolidation process, coupled with the synthesis by chemical                   reactions, to gain predictive capabilities.  The research is                    performed at New Mexico Tech. (high-pressure impact, scale-up),                 Los Alamos (modeling), Sandia (shock-wave facilities, modeling),                and California Institute of Technology (shock-consolidation                     theory).                                                                             This is an excellent area of research, where the U.S. is                   lagging international competition.  The research has potentially                high pay-off with the capability to produce new materials.                      Modeling of the process variables is needed to permit the scaling               up of the process to larger sizes and more complex shapes.",
