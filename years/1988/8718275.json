 "awd_abstract_narration": "Forty five radio sources will be selected from the third Cambridge              (3C) \"1 Jansky\" catalog; the Parkes, Australia \"0.1 Jansky\"                     catalog; and the Leiden Berkeley Deep Survey (LBDS).  Galaxies                  having redshifts close to 0.45 will be studied in the optical,                  infrared and radio wavebands.  This sample spans 4 orders of                    magnitude in radio luminosity at a single cosmic epoch,                         corresponding to a look-back time of roughly 30% of the age of the              Universe.  This is ideal for differentiating between the effects                of epoch and power radiated.  Specific analyses will be made of                 the colors and stellar populations of the radio-galaxies, their                 optical morphology, the strength of the nuclear and extra nuclear               line emission, the density and nature of the their cluster                      environments and the morphology and power of the radio source                   itself.  Relationships between these properties will be sought,                 and direct comparisons with the radio source population at the                  present epoch and with the non-radio population at z ~ 0.45 will                be made.  In addition, the nature and evolution of the other                    galaxies in the clusters will be examined and compared with                     existing data on the `Butcher-Oemler' clusters.  This will                      significantly extend the range of high redshift clusters studies                and may illuminate links between the evolution of the environment               and the radio sources.",
