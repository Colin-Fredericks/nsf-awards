 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System                         (UNOLS), an association of academic institutions, was established               in 1971 as a coordinating and planning mechanism for                            oceanographic facilities operated by those institutions.  The                   UNOLS Office is the focal point for planning, coordination, and                 reporting of all UNOLS activities.  It provides administrative                  staff services, prepares and disseminates ship schedules, user                  requirements, analyses of annual ship use, committee reports, new               marine regulations and other related information.  Support for                  special studies and activities, the medical advisory service for                ship's crews and scientists, travel expenses by UNOLS Advisory                  Council members, committees, and consultants is also provided                   through the UNOLS Office.                                                                                                                                       This project will conduct the activities of the UNOLS Office                    during the first year of a three year commitment to UNOLS Office                operations by five Federal agencies.  These agencies include: The               National Science Foundation (Division of Ocean Sciences and                     Division of Polar Programs), The Department of the Navy (Office                 of Naval Research), The U.S. Department of Energy, The National                 Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and The U.S Department of               the Interior (U.S Geological Survey and Minerals Management                     Service).                                                                                                                                                       The UNOLS Office is located at the University of Washington's                   School of Oceanography. This project is under the direction of                  Captain William D. Barbee, Executive Secretary, UNOLS.",
