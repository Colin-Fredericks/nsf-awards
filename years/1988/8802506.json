 "awd_abstract_narration": "China contains a substantial fraction of the earth's exposures of               ancient rocks, mostly unknown to Western geologists.  This proposal             in early crustal studies between Dr. Kent C. Condie of the New                  Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology and Dr. Qian Xianglin of              Beijing University will characterize terranes of the Gehuyao area of            Northeast China by a collaborative field and geochemical study of               Archean high grade supracrustal rocks and associated intrusive                  rocks.  This granulite belt contains excellent exposures of all                 supracrustal lithologies typical of Archean high grade terranes,                with widespread felsic and mafic granulites of probable igneous                 origin.  Its parallel greenstone and high grade belts offer an                  unusual opportunity to study the structural and compositional                   relationship of these two Archean associations.  Because its                    abundant mafic granulites probably reflect a deeper section of                  Archean crust than is exposed in southern India and elsewhere, a                more accurate estimate of the composition of the lower Archean crust            should be possible, shedding light on how the continents formed.                                                                                                The researchers will map critical exposures, complete major and                 trace element analysis of both metaigneous and metasedimentary                  rocks, perform geochemical studies of magma origin and source,                  conduct structural and metamorphic studies.  German and French                  collaborators will study geothermometry geobarometry and Nd and Pb              isotropes, and do U Pb zircon dating.  This project is jointly                  sponsored by NSF and the Chinese National Natural Science                       Foundation.",
