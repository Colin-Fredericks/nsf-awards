 "awd_abstract_narration": "The extent of finite soil deformation caused by liquefaction, flow and          solidification, is addressed in this project.  The study of the two-            dimensional interactions between viscous two-component boundary layers          and solidification waves, is undertaken for establishing criteria               (based on soil properties and ground geometry) for predicting the               extent of lateral spreading and flow failures.  The study is based on           a one-dimensional solidification process and a model constructed on             the basis of two superimposed and interacting continua, the liquid and          the solids.  The investigation thus, is an extension and                        generalization of those findings to two dimensions, where the analysis          focuses on the development of the two-dimensional constitutive                  relations between stress and strain rate in this bi-continuum                   framework.  The results of this study will provide a more reliable way          of predicting the extent of lateral spreading and flow failures in the          event of a ground related hazard, and of estimating the damage                  potential to structures.",
