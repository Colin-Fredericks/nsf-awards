 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            designed to increase the participation of minorities in scientific and          engineering research.  The program provides support to strengthen the           research environments and capabilities of institutions that have                substantial minority student enrollments.  Eligible institutions must           also have graduate programs in science or programs in engineering.              The principal investigators at the New Mexico State University will             use RIMI support to evaluate electromagnetic interference and electric          cross-talk problems between adjacent leads on microchip surfaces.               Researchers will also develop computer-aided experimental (CAE) tools           to do efficient electronic packaging.  The proposed research will use           various analytical, numerical, and experimental procedures that will            enable design engineers to recognize and correct potential packaging            problems.                                                                                                                                                       This project on methods to improve the reliability of electronic                systems will strengthen the research infrastructure of a productive             institution that educates students at the cutting edge of science.              The principal investigator is a young and talented minority who has             started a very promising research career in the field of electrical             and computer engineering.  He has completed training at the White               Sands Missile Range specializing in Analog to Digital Interface                 Systems that are used in radar.  As a result of this RIMI project,              more minorities students will have the opportunity to select careers            in science and engineering.",
