 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is to provide funds for the purchase of a Cahn TG 121                thermogravimetric system to be utilized in studies of diffusion and             sorption of large organic molecules in pillared clays.  Pillared clays          are catalytic materials consisting of very regular porous structures            with uses in for example, gas oil cracking, methanol conversion to              olefins and toluene ethylation.                                                                                                                                 The equipment will be used to study the diffusivity of various organic          molecules in pillared clays by low pressure sorption experiments in a           Perkin-Elmer TGS-2 UHV thermogravimetric system.  The procedure will            consist of placing small amounts of finely ground pillared clay in the          quartz microbalance, introducing gas into the apparatus and then                measuring the uptake.  There are no other thermogravimetric systems in          the Chemical Engineering Department at USC and this will be of great            benefit to the PI's research effort in preparing new pillard materials          and for improving the catalytic and sieving properties of pillared              clays already in existence.  He has already made valuable                       contributions in this area and this equipment will greatly benefit his          experimental efforts.",
