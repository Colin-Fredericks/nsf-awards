 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are three thrusts to the work that will be performed:                     electronic structure calculations, dynamic magnetic                             susceptibilities, and exact solutions of some model Hamiltonians                of many body theory as defined on a finite cluster.  The                        structure calculations emphasize three and four dimensional                     transition metals with expanded lattices and/or different atomic                arrangements from equilibrium.  Some calculations have been                     completed, others are planned.  The magnetic susceptibility                     studies attempt to provide models for the interpretation of                     inelastic neuron scatering experiments in the paramagnetic                      region.  Studies of nickel have been completed, and calculations                for iron will be made because there are excellent theoretical                   reason to expect significant differences.  Finite clusters have                 become a theorist's laboratory for investigating exact solutions                of many body problems.  This work is new, interesting, and                      important.  The complex case of the lattice Anderson model is                   under investigation.  These techniques are being applied to the                 study of electron interactions in high temperature                              superconductors.",
