 "awd_abstract_narration": "Alabama A&M University proposes the establishment of a Center to study          Nonlinear Optics and Optical Materials.  Investigators at the Center            will perform reserch in quantum optics and in the preparation of                materials for optical and electronic systems.  Studies will include             the growth of bulk crystals of semiconductors and optically active              materials from solution.  These crystals will be characterized,                 resulting in the development of growth models.  In addition, infrared           detectors will be constructed and interactions between cosmic rays and          semiconductors will be examined.  The center will also be used to               motivate minority students at all educational levels to consider                careers in science and engineering.  The strategies to strengthen               partnerships with industry will be developed.                                                                                                                   This project meets the major goal of the Minority Research Centers of           Excellence (MRCE) program:  to increase the minority presence in                science and engineering by making substantial resources available to            upgrade the research capabilities of a highly research productive               minority institution.  The project will at the same time enable                 Alabama A&M to use research as a tool to increase  the effectiveness            of related science and engineering activities for minority groups in            its region.  In addition, the project will provide opportunities for            minority faculty and students at Alabama A&M and nearby institutions            with significant minority enrollments to engage in meritorious                  research that leads to publications in referred journals.",
