 "awd_abstract_narration": "As we learn more about stress and the social psychological                      factors that affect it, it becomes increasingly clear that these                factors are complex and that duration of exposure to stress is                  also important in determining outcomes.  We know a great deal                   about acute laboratory stress but relatively little about longer                lasting stress occurring in the real world.  Most people                        experience repeated episodes of stress during the course of                     everyday life, and the effects of these experiences may be                      important.  Some people experience more constant long-term,                     stress as a result of a particular condition such as the illness                of a child.  This research will explore the latter case, where                  substantial stress is experienced more or less continuously.  The               ways in which social support and changes in the perceived social                support affect the experience of stress due to one's child's                    life-threatening illness will also be studied, as will the role                 of uncertainty.                                                                                                                                                 In order to do this, a sample of parents of children who are                    seriously ill (neoplastic disease) will be compared with a sample               of parents whose children are healthy.  Over the next year-and-a-               half, each parent will be studied nine times at two month                       intervals.  During each session, several psychological and                      physiological measures will be collected including information                  about the child's health, symptom reporting, perceived stress,                  social support, uncertainty, blood pressure, immune status, and                 hormonal activity.  Changes in each child's condition will be                   noted and used to help track changes in parents' response.                      Completion of this research should provide a more complete                      picture of how people respond to chronic stress and how social                  support affects this response.  In addition, the possibility of                 psychophysiological correlates of uncertainty will be evaluated                 and the role of uncertainty in stress and social support effects                will be clarified.",
