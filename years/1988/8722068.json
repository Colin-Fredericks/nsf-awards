 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will contribute to the scientific basis for                  integrating production and inventory control as it relates to                   material flow in small-lot assembly.  This work will focus on                   the electronics industry; however, the results could find                       general application in a broad range of assembly systems.                            The research will also add to the understanding of the                     particular process of inventorying/accumulating components for                  assembly through an examination of five alternative model                       building paradigms.  The new models developed as part of this                   research will be based on Phase-type and Coxian-type                            distributions to better capture the complexities of small-lot                   assembly systems.  Other areas to be studied include cost-                      effective management procedures, effective means of allocating                  on-hand components to satisfy customer requirements while                       promoting assembly productivity, and flexible models of                         transient material flow for coordinating operations.  The                       research program includes relevant interaction with industry.",
