 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most colored-seed alleles of the maize R gene are metastable.                   Pigmentation is reduced heritably by heterozygosity with                        certain alleles (paramutation) and increased heritably in                       still other combinations.  The changes are cumulative over                      generations.  Exploratory tests using restriction enzymes                       whose action is sensitive to cytosine methylation indicate                      hypermethylation in the R region of DNA from paramutant R                       alleles.  We propose to characterize this change in the least                   complex alleles that undergo paramutation, utilizing a graded                   series of pigmentation levels that includes enhanced as well                    as reduced states.  Other phenomena of R action to be                           characterized in terms of DNA modification include: a marked                    influence of alkylating agents on R paramutation, differences                   in R pigmentation level following transmission through pollen                   and ovule, and the dependence of paramutation of R plant                        pigmentation on presence of seed-color component in the                         allelic complex.  Components responsible for inducing                           paramutation that have been mapped genetically in the R-                        stippled allele are to be characterized molecularly.                                                                                                            Paramutation is a genetic phenomena for which there is as yet                   no molecular explanation.  In this system the best understood                   example of paramutation in any organism, indications are that                   methylation of the DNA is involved.  Results from this study                    should provide further insight into the mechanisms involved                     in gene expression and may enhance commercial applications of                   genetic engineering.",
