 "awd_abstract_narration": "We intend to make a strong contribution toward the achievement of a             density approaching 109 bits per square inch in high data rate mass             storage systems within the next decade.  We are placing primary                 emphasis on principles and techniques that will permit the increase of          track density in longitudinal and perpendicular magnetic recording,             with a provisional goal of order 104 turns per inch.  The thrust of             the work will be in magnetics, and will involve studies of the edge-            reading and writing properties of inductive and magnetoresistive                recording heads and of the edge definition of thin film media.  The             work will be carried out as a collaboration between Washington                  University and Hewlett-Packard Laboratories.  The individual tasks to           be undertaken have been formulated jointly, based on the experience of          the current NSF supported collaboration.  This collaboration is                 producing tools appropriate for the proposed work, and has resulted in          a more sharply focused approach.  Theoretical work and interpretation           of experimental results will be concentrated at WU, fabrication of              media and devices, experimental facilities, and large scale                     computation will be provided by HP labs for the WU principal                    investigator and graduate students and for the HP engineers and                 scientists directly participating in the work.",
