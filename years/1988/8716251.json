 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new method has been developed for the measurement of                  lithium isotope ratios in geological material, as a result of an                initial study funded by NSF.  The mass spectrometric technique                  involves the thermal ionization of lithium tetraborate and is                   capable of producing 6Li/7Li ratios with an uncertainty of 1.3                  0/00 (one standard deviation).  The results of a preliminary                    survey indicate important variation of th eisotope composition of               Li in the marine environment and demonstrate the usefulness of Li               isotope ratio as a tracer for mass exchange in the ocean.                               This proposal summarizes the findings of the initial                    research and requests support for a comprehensive investigation                 of the marine isotope geochemistry of lithium.  Efforts will be                 directed at determining the isotopic composition of the sources                 and sinks of Li in the ocean and the  isotopic fractionation                    associated with the mass transfer processes.  The main emphasis                 is on the utilization of Li isotope systematics in the                          understanding of (1)  the control on the Li isotopic composition                of seawater, (2) the direction and magnitude of Li transfer                     during seawater-basalt interaction and (3)  the process by which                Li is enriched in marine sediments.  These considerations address               the problem of mass balance of Li in the ocean and is of                        fundamental importance in the characterization of the geochemical               cycle of Li.",
