 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project are to give students experience             with state-of-the-art analytical equipment, and to increase their               familiarity with quantitative biology.  To address these issues, this           department is equipping its physiology laboratory with four computer-           interfaced data acquisition systems with physiological monitors for the         measurement of bioelectrical and biomechanical activities.  These data          acquisition systems, supported by the appropriate software, are capable         of data storage, analysis, manipulation, and retrieval.  The                    simulation capabilities of the computer may be exploited also for the           visualization of equations used for modeling various physiological              processes.  Students then may compare the theoretical and actual                outputs of each physiological system studied.                                                                                                                        Processes to be studied using this equipment include muscle,               skin, and nerve activity, cardiovascular physiology, respiration, and           glandular secretion.  Mastery of this equipment provides the                    undergraduate with a background for understanding the operation                 principles of other types of equipment using the sensor/transducer/             amplifier/ recorder component series.  The simulation experience helps          students to bridge the conceptual gap between real physiological                processes and their mathematical models.                                                                                                                             The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
