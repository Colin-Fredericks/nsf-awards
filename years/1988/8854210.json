 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two, two-week summer workshops will be held to acquaint                    undergraduate professors with new curricular ideas in the areas                 of discrete mathematics, geometry, and their applications.                      Leaders in each field, both academics and practitioners, will                   interact with fifty participants from all parts of the Nation to                enable them to understand new developments in these mathematical                fields and to prepare applications-based materials suitable for                 use in their classrooms.  Areas to be discussed are problem-                    solving strategies using combinatorics and graph theory,                        applications of graph theory to social sciences, graphical                      algorithms in discrete math.  In geometry, emphasis will center                 on tilings, combinatorial geometry, and studies in computational                geometry.                                                                                                                                                           A formal follow-up session will be held at the national                     Joint AMS/MAA meeting in January of 1989, where participants will               discuss the impact of the training on their campuses.  This                     meeting will be preceded by two teleconferences, during which the               participants and the experts can continue their dialogue and                    refine the curricula materials developed at the conference.                                                                                                     In addition to the NSF funds, participants' institutions will                   contribute about 20% in travel costs to the operation of the                    project.",
