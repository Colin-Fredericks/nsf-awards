 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research has theoretical and practical implications for the                current debates about America's industrial competitiveness.  It                 involves the optimal structure, costs and quality of buyer and seller           relationships between and within firms in an industry.  This project            will investigate the product delivery process and the performance of            supplier relationships within the context of two large U.S.                     multinational consumer durable and capital goods firms.  It also has            the potential of adding to our knowledge on how to foster innovation.                                                                                           Supplier performance is studied in the framework of three research              objectives.  First, the recent spate of empirical work using                    Williamson's transaction cost model is consolidated and expanded to             generate hypotheses specifying differences in performance between               suppliers inside and outside the buyer firm and between outside                 suppliers.  Second, an administrative innovation in supplier management         recently implemented in both firms provides an opportunity to examine a         form of \"relational\" contracting that applies to both inside and                outside suppliers.   The third research objective focuses on                    differences between the two participating firms in the success of               implementing the supplier management innovation; the basis for the              hypothesized differences is the dissimilarity of the firms' vertical            integration policies.",
