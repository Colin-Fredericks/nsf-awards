 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clonal plants differ from many familiar types of plants and             animals, in that they are made up of a number of genetically                    identical individuals that are interconnected with each other.                  Increase in population size results from the production of new                  plants from those that already exist rather than from production                of seed.  The principal goals of the proposed research are to                   determine to what degree individual plants that comprise a clone                are physiologically linked to each other, what affect the amount                of linkage has on the production of new plants, and how the                     presence or absence of linkage influences the pattern of                        population growth, and hence, persistence of the clone.                                 Manipulations of resource availability will be performed in             the field, and the short-term and long-term developmental                       consequences of these manipulations studied.  Radioactive carbon                labeling experiments and tissue nutrient analyses will reveal                   patterns of resource movement and utilization within clones, and                whether they vary through the year.  The proposed studies will                  increase our understanding of the relationship between                          physiological integration and clonal demography, and contribute                 to our understanding of the costs of reproduction and the                       appropriate unit of selection in this and other clonal plants.                          Many commercially important plants (forage grasses,                     strawberries), and commercially costly weeds (water hyacinths,                  crabgrass) grow clonally.  Podophyllum peltatum, the subject of                 this study, is the source of a drug used in cancer treatment,                   podophyllin, an anti-mitotic agent.  Understanding how the                      environment affects the growth of such plants, and how the degree               of physiological integration among the components of such clones                may ameliorate these environmental affects, is a critical step in               learning how to manage the growth of clonal plants effectively.",
