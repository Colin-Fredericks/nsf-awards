 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program is in the area of host-guest chemistry. The                   project is directed toward an understanding of the interaction                  of flexible hosts with a variety of guest molecules. For the                    hosts, focus will be on liquid clathrates and calixarenes.                      Fundamental understanding of the ability of guests to organize                  hosts will be investigated. A comparison of the polarity of the                 cavity and that of the solvent will be sought for a range of                    systems. Heavy reliance on single crystal X-ray diffraction,                    nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular modelling                 will be necessary to characterize the structures and                            interactions. The development of flexible hosts as models for                   clay minerals and for bioinorganic molecules is planned. For                    the latter, calixarenes will be functionalized using standard                   synthetic organic procedures. Aminocalixarenes will be                          synthesized and their complexation of transition metal ions                     will be investigated. Information derived from studies of                       flexible hosts will be applied to problems of separation                        science.                                                                                                                                                        This study is expected to provide important fundamental                         information about interactions between species in solutions and                 about the kinds of interactions which are involved in the                       recognition of substrates by enzymes. The study may also lead                   to new methodology for the separation of mixtures of chemicals.",
