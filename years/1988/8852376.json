 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project permits undergraduate students to study human                 factors/ergonomics in a state-of-the-art laboratory.  Students focus on         gathering information on human capabilities and capacities for use in           optimal design of jobs, products, equipment and the workplace.                                                                                                       The equipment included in this laboratory includes:  gas                   analyzing equipment used to determine physiological cost of heavy               physical work; an environmental chamber which is used to simulate               different environmental conditions - for the study of the effect of             factors such as heat on work performance; anthropometric instruments            used to measure body dimensions in relation to the design and                   evaluation of the workplace and equipment; and, a microcomputer that is         interfaced to the laboratory for data acquisition and analysis.                                                                                                      The equipment is used by students to conduct laboratory                    experiments as part of their coursework and independent studies and             project.
