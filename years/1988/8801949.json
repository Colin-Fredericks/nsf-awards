 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal of this proposal is to obtain an                        understanding of the molecular processes involved in the                        differentiation of an epidermal cell into a plant hair                          (trichome).  The specific objectives include:  1)  Isolate and                  characterize a gene required for elaboration of stem trichomes on               Arabiopsis.  2)  Explore the utility of the trichome gene as a                  marker for transformation.  3)  Isolate and characterize other                  trichome specific genes.  The starting point for this work is a                 mutant of Arabidopsis that lacks stem trichomes.  This mutant was               isolated from a population of plants that were transformed with                 Agrobacterium.  Because the mutation is most likely induced by a                T-DNA insert, the isolation of the trichome gene will be                        facilitated by a T-DNA probe.  The significance is three fold.                  First, the differentiation of an epidermal cell into a trichome                 provides a relatively simple model for cell differentiation.                    Second, since trichomes are associated with important traits such               as insect resistance, salt tolerance, and cotton quality, the                   understanding of trichome formation on Arabidopsis may provide                  information on how trichomes of crop species might be manipulated               for crop improvement.  Finally, the stem trichome gene may                      function as a visible transformation marker.                                    %%%                                                                                 Dr. Marks is studying the differentiation of an epidermal                   cell into a plant hair (trichome).  This provides a relatively                  simple model for studying cell differentiation. Since trichomes                 are associated with important traits such as insect resistance,                 salt tolerance, and cotton quality, the understanding of trichome               formation on Arabidopsis (a plant more amenable to study than                   commercially important crops) may provide information on how                    trichomes of crop species might be manipulated for crop                         improvement.",
