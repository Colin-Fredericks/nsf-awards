 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Presidential Young Investigator Award project is in the                    general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the                     subfield of interfacial charge transfer.  The objective of this                 research is to develop a quantitative, predictive description of                the microscopic variables which control photoeffects at the                     semiconductor/liquid junction.  Specific efforts include                        exploration of new semiconductor/liquid junctions, development of               quantitative theories for describing behavior of known systems,                 and development of chemical and physical probes for the                         characterization of surface recombination sites at these                        junctions.                                                                                                                                                      This action provides the $25,000 base plus $37,500 in fully                     matched funds for the fifth and final year of this Presidential                 Young Investigator Award which was originally granted to                        Professor Lewis (CHE-8352151) when he was a faculty member at                   Stanford University.  The studies which are enabled by this award               are providing insights into how photoelectrochemical processes at               semiconductor/liquid interfaces can be controlled and are pointing              the way toward the rational design of new and improved                          photoelectrochemical systems.",
