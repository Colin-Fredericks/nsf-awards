 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal proposes to conduct a two-week Supercomputer Summer               Institute in August 1988.  Attending would be 30 young researchers              from across the U.S., including five researchers from SDSC industrial           research partners.  Review of applications will be made by the SDSC             Allocation Panel, a panel of computational scientists which normally            reviews applications for supercomputer resources at the SDSC.                                                                                                   Lectures and working sessions will give the students a strong                   grounding in the practical techniques of supercomputer usage and                expose them to the wide range of research activities using                      supercomputing.  Each student will have a Macintosh workstation fo              use during the Institute, as well as access to more advanced graphics           workstations from a variety of vendors, such as the Sun, Apollo and             Iris.   The SDSC has conducted similar successful institutes in 1986            and 1987.                                                                                                                                                       Negotiations have reduced the budget from the $60,909 originally                proposed while retaining the proposal's quality.  An award to the San           Diego Supercomputer Center for a 1988 Summer Institute is recommended           in the amount of $50,000.",
