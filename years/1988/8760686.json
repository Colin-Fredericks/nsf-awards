 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chemical composition of the troposphere is                       determined by the sources and sinks of biogenic and anthropogenic               trace gases and the intervening photochemical transformations and               mass transport processes linking them.  The recent recognition                  that a thorough understanding of these processes in the natural                 atmosphere is necessary before the effects of man-made                          perturbations may be assessed has prompted a concerted effort to                study the natural troposphere.  The insight gained from this                    research will allow more accurate predictions of the impact of                  man's activities on the environment.                                                    The objective of this Phase I SBIR research project is the              development of instrumentation to measure fluxes of atmospheric                 trace gases to or from the earth's surface.  The method to be                   investigated is based on the well established eddy correlation                  technique and would use a tunable diode laser light source                      combined with a multiple pass absorption cell to detect trace                   species at sub-part-per-billion levels.  The instrument would be                designed specifically to be interfaced with a sonic anemometer to               provide fast time response and minimal flowfield interference as                required for the eddy correlation method.  In the Phase I study,                designs for a reduced pressure trace gas sampling system are to                 be evaluated and tested, and a multiple pass absorption cell                    which maximizes the path length and minimizes interference                      fringes will be designed and evaluated.  The results of the Phase               I effort are expected to resolve critical design issues and                     permit the development of field instrumentation in succeeding                   phases.  The final instrument will be applicable to flux                        measurements of trace gases including sulfur dioxide, nitric                    oxide, nitrogen dioxide, nitric acid, ozone, and hydrogen                       peroxide.",
