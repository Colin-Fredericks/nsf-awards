 "awd_abstract_narration": "The formation of myelin by the Schwann cell requires the precise                organization of a number of specific proteins.  The long-term                   goals of this research are to understand how the Schwann cell                   delivers these proteins to the correct surface of the bipolar                   Schwann Cell.  The immediate goals are to examine how the Schwann               cell regulates the expression of one such protein, Po                           glycoprotein, when the external environment is changed.  Because                studies in vivo suggest that post-translational control of Po                   expression is important, the role of the sugar moieties in the                  expression of this glycoprotein will be investigated.  To carry                 out these studies an abundance of Po is required.  This will be                 accomplished by transfecting Schwann cells with the cDNA for Po                 followed by gene amplification.  Furthermore, the transfected Po                will be distinguished from the endogenously synthesized Po by                   attaching to the former an identifier/reporter peptide sequence.                To ensure that Po with the reporter peptide is expressed/sorted                 in the same way as its endogenous counterpart, both will be                     characterized in transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary cells, prior                 to the studies with Schwann cells.  Ultimately, the expression of               Po-reporter will be monitored in Schwann cells in relation to the               addition of axolemma and/or extracellular matrix to the culture                 before and after treatment specific inhibitors of glycosylation.                Results from these studies can then be applied directly to                      Schwann cells in vivo and help elucidate the initial steps of                   myelinogenesis at the molecular level.",
