 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since 1971, the Exploratorium Explainer Program has provided more than          1,000 young men and women of high school age with meaningful work and           education opportunities in science and public education.  In 1988,              eighty to one hundred students from San Francisco and greater Bay Area          high schools will be chosen to work as Explainers for one or two                semesters.  The Explainers' \"job\" is to help the Exploratorium's large          and diverse public use and understand our collection of interactive             exhibits.  The Explainers undergo intensive training in aspects of              science before they begin working, and continue to attend weekend               sessions on specific phenomena throughout their tenure at the museum.           Explainers receive about seventy hours of formal instruction in science         which is augmented by extensive one-on-one association between each             Explainer and our Senior education, research and exhibit development            staff.  In addition, throughout the year the Exploratorium host                 visiting scholars and scientists who meet with the Explainers to                discuss their work, as well as more general issues of scientific                controversy and philosophy.                                                                                                                                     Through hands-on experience -- building and operating actual                    demonstrations of phenomena, setting up biological experiments for the          public, and maintaining exhibit apparatus -- the Explainers gain a deep         familiarity with the fundamental concepts and activities of several             scientific disciplines.  Through  daily contact with museum staff and           visiting scientists, field trips to research sites, and other                   enrichment activities, they become acquainted with the day-to-day               experiences of working in scientific fields.",
