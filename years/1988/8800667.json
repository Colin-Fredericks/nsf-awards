The Program is the academic                   component of a collaboration between the Geophysical Fluid                      Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) of NOAA and the Geological and                       Geophysical Sciences Department at Princeton University.  GFDL                  scientists serve as advisors and adjunct faculty for students in                the AOS Program.  Research covers a broad range of topics aimed                 at improving our understanding of motion in atmospheres and                     oceans on all geophysical scales.  In addition, under this award,               support will be provided for a student from the Applied and                     Computational Mathematics Program to investigate some of the                    mathematical aspects of geophysical fluid dynamics.                                  The program, which has been in existence since 1968, is                    well known for its excellence and the high quality of independent               research carried out by the students.  Its graduates are among                  the best researchers in the country today.  For NSF, this award                 represents an investment in the future.",
