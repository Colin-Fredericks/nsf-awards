 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports participation by U.S.                       scientists in a symposium on underground engineering to be held                 in New Delhi.  The topics will include construction of tunnels                  for hydro-electric power and their stability problems, and of                   facilities for high-level radioactive waste in underground                      repositories; rock burst problems in very deep underground                      excavations such as in Indian gold mines.  The Indian                           coordinator of the symposium is Dr. A. K. Dube, Head,                           Geomechanics, Central Mining Research Station Unit, Central                     Building Research Institute, Roorkee, India.  The U.S.                          participants will present papers on their research, and will                    visit Indian research facilities especially at the University of                Roorkee and at the Kolar gold field mines to learn of research                  results and experiences.                                                                                                                                        Scope:  Indian scientists responsible for helping Indian                        industrial development have dealt with major structural problems                in mining, hydro-electric power and nuclear waste disposal.                     They had to conduct research to deal with these problems.  They,                and the U.S. participants can exchange information on their                     experiences and possibly develop a viable program of                            collaboration in this area.",
