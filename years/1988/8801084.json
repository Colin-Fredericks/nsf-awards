 "awd_abstract_narration": "Considerable current effort in limnology focuses on the                         contributions of nutrient supply and food web structure to the                  regulation of productivity in planktonic ecosystems.  This effort               promotes a synthesis of community and ecosystem perspectives.                   The main goal of this proposal is to investigate an important                   question that has emerged from such recent syntheses:  how does                 the strength of phytoplankton-zooplankton coupling change between               lakes of differing trophic status?  We propose to answer this                   question by performing experimental manipulations of zooplankton                and nutrients in mesocosms in four lakes which encompass a broad                range of trophic states.  Factorial manipulations of zooplankton                and nutrients will directly assess grazing impacts and the extent               of enhancement of algal growth by zooplankton nutrient                          regeneration.  Exposure of phytoplankton to a broad range of                    zooplankton densities will reveal non-linear algal responses and                evaluate their responses to zooplankton densities that might                    arise from seasonal or inter-annual variation.  Finally, by                     evaluating algal responses at the species, community, and                       aggregate (\"ecosystem\") levels, we will try to integrate                        approaches characteristic of population, community, and ecosystem               ecology.  The results of this study will assist both theoretical                and applied limnologists in understanding the complex                           interaction between phytoplankton and zooplankton.  This                        interaction represents the crucial link which transfers                         photosynthetic production to consumers higher in the food web and               which translates changes in food web structure into changes in                  ecosystem properties such as primary productivity.",
