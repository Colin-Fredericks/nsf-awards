 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tribological processes at materials interfaces are of major                     technological importance since they are the source of wear and                  degradation as well as frictional energy dissipation.                           Fundamental understanding of the physics and chemistry of                       tribological phenomena is of particular importance for the                      development of advanced materials required to function under                    extreme ambient conditions and for long periods of time.                        Although there is an immense body of empirical data, there is no                detailed microscopic theory of tribological phenomena.  This                    project is concerned with the microscopic mechanisms of friction,               lubrication and wear at material interfaces.  It focuses on two                 topics.  They are studies of lubricants, lubrication, and plastic               flow,and studies of tribological processes at interfaces between                amorphous and crystalline materials.  These studies will be                     performed through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.  The MD                  method allows one to follow the time evolution of the dynamical                 state of a system of interacting particles by integration of the                classical equations of motion.  In this method, the particle                    interactions are prescribed by pair potentials.  The number of                  particles normally included in this type of analysis is between                 one and ten thousand.  The method is applicable to systems in                   various stages of aggregation (solid, liquid, crystalline, or                   amorphous), under various conditions and in the presence of                     complex interactions and external fields.  Furthermore, the                     method allows the study of structural changes that materials                    undergo at elevated pressure and temperature and there is                       evidence that careful simulations are in agreement with                         experimental structural data.  The intent of the project is to                  provide a systematic method of predicting the complex phenomena                 of friction, lubrication and wear processes.",
