 "awd_abstract_narration": "In SANDALS, thirty young, minority women entering their senior year in          Baltimore City Public Schools sample college life in a supportive               atmosphere during a highly structured, rigorous five week, residential          program.  They will encounter both the challenges and stimulation of            college life as they explore fields of science, examine ethical issues,         learn mathematics, improve study and communication skills and enjoy             field trips in the arts and sciences.  Through dormitory living                 students become more independent and learn to better manage their time          and resources.                                                                                                                                                  The core academic component of Sandals-Teams consists of week-long              mini-courses in biology, earth sciences, chemistry and physics in               which students engage in laboratory activities utilizing instruments            not available in high school.  The mathematics courses focus on                 skills needed in each of the sciences.  In Special Topics, ethical              issues related to each science are explored.  A college-level English           course with a writing support class balances the offerings.  Workshops          in College Survival Skills, Study Skills and Personal Development               provide guidance and strategies for personal success.  Field/career             experiences in the sciences, cultural events, and the high-lightning of         the achievements of women and minorities will expand students'                  horizons.",
