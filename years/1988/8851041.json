 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT CREATE is a cooperative project of the Northmont, Ohio, City            School District and scientists and engineers from local industry and            governmental laboratories.  It will develop materials and facilities for        teaching science in the elementary grades and work with the district's          teachers to enable them to effectively utilize these with their classes.        Once developed and proven in use, the teaching materials will be                disseminated through state and national educational organizations.                                                                                              The district, with strong industrial support and participation, will            develop and equip a \"micro-tech satellite\"  -- a room with science              equipment and exhibits -- in one of its schools which can be used by all        the district's elementary teachers.  It will be used for in-service             activities for teachers and by the district personnel and                       industrial/governmental scientists/engineers who will be developing             hands-on science and mathematics curriculum materials to fit the                following sequence: Grades K-1, plants; 1-2, animals; 3, environment; 4-        5, earth science; 5-6, physical science.                                                                                                                        The use of the partnership concept is intended to insure that both the          science and the pedagogy will be sound, up-to-date, and well integrated.                                                                                        Cost sharing by the partners will total at least 50% of the NSF funding.",
