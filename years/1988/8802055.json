 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project consists of four topics.  The first deals with                 the approximation of the infinite particle systems by large                     finite systems as both the time and the size of the system tend                 to infinity.  These results are particularly important from the                 point of view of the infinite particle systems as models for                    various practical problems.  The second topic concerns the large                deviation rate in a Poisson system of noninteracting random                     walks.  The third topic can be described as the spread of the                   surviving particles following branching process models.  The                    corresponding theoretical questions explore the clustering and                  coalescing behavior of the branching random walks.  The last area               of inquiry is relatively unexplored as yet.  Multitype systems                  with non-attractive, non-additive state space, without duals                    arise naturally in epidemics or chemical reactions.  Such systems               are expected to exhibit new and interesting phenomena.",
