 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference sponsored by the New York Academy of Sciences                   will highlight the remarkable progress achieved over the last few               years concerning calcium channels in excitable tissues.  Advances               were mainly possible because of the development of new Ca++                     channel ligands and of new methods for the detailed functional                  investigation of single Ca++ channel molecules.  Thus, several                  distinct Ca++ channel types with different biophysical,                         physiological, pharmacological and regulatory properties have                   been identified.  New models for the mechanisms of ion permeation               and channel gating have been developed.  New high-affinity                      ligands have allowed the chemical purification and elucidation of               the subunit composition of at least one channel type, the                       localization of channel distribution as well as  the observation                of Ca++ channel expression during development and in various                    diseases.  Additionally, antibodies against Ca++ channels have                  been implicated in the pathogenesis of Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic                 Syndrome, and a specific absence of Ca++ channels has been                      demonstrated in muscular dysgenesis.  Ca++ channel study has                    evolved into a truly multi-disciplinary effort.  The conference                 will bring together scientists from neurobiology, biochemistry,                 molecular biology, physiology and pharmacology, each contributing               a vital part to the understanding of this relevant biological                   signalling pathway.",
