 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution has requested several items of         oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use              equipment.  This equipment is maintained for use on or in association           with the three research vessels the institution operates.  A                    substantial part of the ships' operating schedule during 1988 is in             support of NSF-sponsored research projects.  The instrumentation will           also increase the capabilities of the ships and of the institution to           support research and engineering activities.  The instrumentation               includes:                                                                                                                                                       -A disk drive system and other peripheral equipment for increasing               shared-use computing capabilities,                                             -hull-mounted 12-kHz transducers for obtaining profiles of the                   seafloor,                                                                      -Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler for continuous measurements of                subsurface circulation features,                                               -Precision acoustic pingers for determining position of an instrument            package relative to the surface or seafloor,                                   -incubation chambers for maintaining and growing plankton and other              biological samples, and                                                        -a fume hood for removing chemical fumes from the ship's laboratory.                                                                                            The instrumentation described above will increase the capability of the         Institution to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects.",
