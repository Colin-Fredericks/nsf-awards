 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of this project is to explore concepts for                flexible forming of sheet parts of employing in-process measurement             and control concepts.  The intent is to eliminate long setup and                tooling development times, to greatly improve the process of                    conventional tooling design and to permit small lot size production             of complex sheet parts.  The work will focus on refinement of the               Deformation Transfer Function concept, and on the coupling of this              concept with the flexible forming system that the principal                     investigator has worked with prior to this project.  The control                theory work will concentrate on making stronger theoretical                     connection between the transfer function concept and elastic                    springback in forming, and on extensions to polymer and composite               material.  Experimental work will be conducted on the axisymmetric              system and on the variable configuration die system.  The variable              configuration forming machine itself will be fully evaluated, and               some novel forming methods based on its unique characteristics will             be tested.  Finally, a completely integrated shape commanded forming            system, comprising the new forming machine and the Deformation                  Transfer Function forming control strategy will be developed.",
