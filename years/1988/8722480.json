Using archival data from 1870 to 1930 the project will involve                  the comparison of public and private school enrollments.  Most                  studies of the growth in education in the United States have                    concentrated on the public school system.  This research will                   provide a much more balanced picture of educational expansion by                combining figures for both the public and private schools.  Thus,               this study will contribute to an understanding of the expansion                 in education, the similarities and differences in the factors                   affecting private and public school growth, and the links between               the private and public school enrollments.",
