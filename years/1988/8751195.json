 "awd_abstract_narration": "The involvement of disabled persons in science education is                     critical to the Nation's scientific enterprise.  The potential of               this minority has begun to be recognized however the actual level               of participation remains low.                                                                                                                                   This project seeks to bring into focus the factors influencing                  the successful entry of disabled persons into the fields of                     science, mathematics, and engineering.  The Critical Incident                   technique will be used to gather data on \"barriers\" to working in               the sciences and how these barriers were overcome from 150                      disabled working scientists and from 150 disabled college                       students.  This information will be used to develop booklets of                 two types: career decision  and \"making it\" booklets for pre-                   college students, and an Achiever's book (profiles of disabled                  scientists who can be used as role models) for  secondary and                   post-secondary students.                                                                                                                                        American Institutes for Research will collaborate with the                      American Association for the Advancement of Science (as                         subcontractor) in carring out this research on a national basis.                AAAS will participate in the selection of sample, analysis of                   data, and in the  development and dissemination of materials.                                                                                                   The proposed research is challenging and will provide needed                    information to a critical minority group.  The proposers are                    highly qualified and the research has been carefully designed.                  The reviewers were enthusiastic about this project and                          recommended funding.  The project is planned for a period of 24                 months.",
