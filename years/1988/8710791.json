 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular genetic techniques will be applied to study the                molecular basis of cell motility in non-muscle cells.  As a model               system the myxomycete Physarum will be used.  In this system                    meiotic gene mapping permits identification of mutants by                       classical genetic analysis, allowing long term studies on a                     variety of gene products important in cell motility.  In                        Physarum, extensive biochemical studies indicate that the                       proteins actin and myosin produce the force required for                        cytoplasmic streaming.  Calcium is believed to regulate the                     activity of Physarum actomyosin, perhaps by binding to the                      essential myosin light chain, LC-2.  To verify this hypothesis,                 the principal investigator will identify the cloned gene coding                 for LC-2 and determine its nucleotide sequence.  From this                      information the amino acid sequence of the protein will be                      deduced, and its ability to bind calcium determined by comparison               with the amino acid sequences of known calcium binding proteins.                   The results of this project should shed light on the method of               regulation of motility in non-muscle cells.  The work will also                 provide evidence for the role of myosin light chains in                         actomyosin-based cell motility.",
