 "awd_abstract_narration": "Statistical offices have always had the problem of how to                  distribute the data they generate. Despite advances in computer                 composition, printed publications remain expensive and time                     consuming to produce. Printed media also do not easily lend                     themselves to re-use in extracts, newly generated tables, or                    calculations. Data provided on computer tape not only require                   access to a mainframe computer, they also generally involve                     investment in specialized ad hoc programming services.                               With the spread of personal computers, some statistical                    offices are providing their data on diskettes that can be read by               these machines. However such diskettes are often simple downloads               from mainframe computer tapes, and most users do not have the                   programming support needed to utilize the data or to understand                 and analyze them in the absence of extensive accompanying                       documentation. As a result, sales have been small and the                       productive use of data much curtailed.                                               The research carried out under Phase I of the present                      project successfully tested the feasibility of developing a form                of electronic publishing that would integrate statistical data                  with their documentation so that users could read the output                    directly, as in a printed publication, and the computer could                   utilize it directly for processing and analytic purposes. Phase I               also successfully developed prototype software that would allow                 users to list, retrieve, and browse through tabular data and                    documentation, make extracts from them, and print them out or                   translate them into forms suitable for processing by other                      software packages.                                                                   The recommended award will support the final (Phase II)                    stage of a project funded under the Small Business Innovation                   Research Program. Phase II will be concerned with advancing the                 accomplishments of Phase I into a generalized reference library                 system capable of serving the varied dissemination practices of                 different statistical agencies, providing facilities for                        retrieving and merging data from different databases, including                 bases containing diverse types of data, and furnishing processing               and analytic tools that meet the needs of the casual user at the                same time as they satisfy the more complex requirements of                      advanced users, including data providers. Phase II will also be                 concerned with creating modifications to the basic software that                adapt its operating characteristics and special features to the                 changing landscape of computer technology and electronic                        publishing.                                                                          The products and services to be developed under Phase II                   research will be undertaken in cooperation with statistical                     offices of various sorts both at home and abroad. The resultant                 technology will thereafter be offered to such data sources via                  direct sale or leasing arrangements. Since large corporations                   face many of the same data handling problems as statistical                     offices in the public sector, extension of the technology to                    corporate users will be explored.",
