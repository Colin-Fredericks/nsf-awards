 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action is for the maintenance of the Guerrero accelerograph                array.  The array consists of 30 strong motion accelerographs for               recording earthquake-induced strong ground motions.  The instruments            are installed in Guerrero and neighboring states in Mexico.  The array          was installed under NSF award 82-19432, the installation and continued          operation of this array being a cooperative project between the                 University of Nevada at Reno and the Institute of Engineers of the              National University of Mexico.                                                                                                                                  Earthquake hazard mitigation efforts are predicated upon an                     understanding of the strong ground motions that are induced by                  earthquakes.  While small earthquakes are common in seismic zones,              large damaging earthquakes are rare and, so far, unpredictable.  As a           result, information needed on strong ground motions is scarce, and              there is an urgent need to obtain this data.  The Guerrero array is             strategically placed so as to record ground motions from three seismic          gaps (areas where earthquakes are predicted to occur in the near                future) for each of which large earthquakes are expected.  It was               still being installed when the September 19, 1985 earthquake hit                Mexico City and excellent strong ground motion records were obtained;           these records continue to yield valuable information on earthquake              hazard mitigation.",
