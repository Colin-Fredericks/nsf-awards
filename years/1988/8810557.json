 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Valentini is supported by a grant fom The Physical                       Chemistry Program to study the structure and dynamics of                        transition states in gas phase chemical reactions.  Valentini                   has developed a spectroscopic technique which permits the                       indirect observation of the short-lived intermediates                           (transition states) which have long been theoretically                          predicted but never observed in chemical reactions.                                                                                                                Dr. Valentini's research involves the studies of so-called                   Feshbach resonances in rotational excitation cross sections                     which are observed for chemical reactions in the gas phase.                     The direct observations involve state-to-state dynamics in                      which the vibrational and rotational quantum states (v,j) of                    the reactants are prepared by free-jet expansion cooling and                    probed by stimulated Raman excitation.  The collision energy of                 the reactants is selected, varied, and precisely specified                      through laser photolysis of a diatomic precursor to generate                    the reactant atom.  Vibrational and rotational (v',j') analysis                 of the reaction products under single collision conditions are                  effected using resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionizaiton.                                                                                                          Dr. Valentini's research program is motivated by his recent                  discovery of Feschbach resonances in the ortho-, para-hydrogen                  exchange reaction.  This observation permitted him to infer the                 vibrational energy states of the linear triatomic transition                    state which occurs in this reaction.  Further studies in this                   area will involve the hydrogen deuterium exchange reaction, the                 reaction of chlorine with hydrogen chloride, and the reaction                   of iodine and bromine with their corresponding hydrogen                         halides.  Coherent Raman spectra of these species will be                       obtained to elucidate the nature of the theoretically predicted                 vibrational bonding.",
