 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although campaign acitivists are playing an increasingly                        important role in American electoral politics, there is very                    little in the way of systematic knowledge concerning who they                   are, what they believe, and how they operate.  This research is                 directed at addressing these issues by examining presidential                   campaign activists in the 1988 election.  The study will provide                insights into the nature and activities of these important                      presidential campaign activists.                                                                                                                                The data for this analysis will be obtained from three main                     sources.  First, the primary focus of the study consists of a                   national telephone survey of county.level presidential activists,               to be conducted during the two months prior to the 1988 election.               Second, the researchers will also conduct a national mail survey                of county party chairpersons.  Third, the investigators will have               access to public opinion data from a national sample of the                     American electorate, obtained from the University of Michigan                   Center for Political Studies' 1988 National Election Study.  The                three surveys will select respondents from the same set of                      counties across the United States.  This will enable the                        investigators to make direct comparisons across the three main                  types of actors in American presidential elections:  campaign                   activists, party leaders, and the voters.                                                                                                                       With the data obtained from the surveys, the investigators will                 address four main questions about the role of presidential                      parties in American politics.  First, have presidential parties                 become stronger since 1972?  Second, what are the issue                         orientations of presidential activists?  Third, how do policy                   attitudes of activists compare to those of constituents?                        Finally, what is the the degree of overlap between the                          presidential parties and the formal party organization?                                                                                                         American electoral politics is changing over time in important                  ways.  Analysts are not in agreement about the nature of the                    changes.  Regardless of the evolving form and procedures in                     national elections, it appears certain that the presidential                    parties will continue to play a vital role.  Therefore, it is                   important to gain an understanding of these organizations                       and this project is directed at accomplishing this objective.",
