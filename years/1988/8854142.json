 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new approach to teaching undergraduate organic chemistry                      lab is to carry out the experiments on 1/100th to 1/1000th the                  scale previously used.  In this way student exposure to sub-                    stances which are toxic, flammable, corrosive, carcinogenic,                    teratagenic, and mutagenic is reduced by a corresponding                        amount and there are concomittant savings in the disposal of                    laboratory waste and the purchase of reagents and solvents.                     Since the apparatus and techniques differ from those used                       in the past, faculty need some guidance before embarking on                     this way of teaching the undergraduate organic laboratory.                      To this end three week-long workshops on teaching microscale                    organic experiments will be conducted at Mount Holyoke College                  in June of l988.  Participants will have an opportunity to                      carry out microscale experiments under the guidance of the                      project director, the author of a recent laboratory manual                      in microscale organic chemistry, assisted by undergraduates                     who have helped develop these experiments.                                                                                                                      In addition to NSF funds, participants' institutions                            will contribute about 40% in travel costs toward the cost                       of the project.",
