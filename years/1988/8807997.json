 "awd_abstract_narration": "A direct connection will be made between ultrafast time                         resolved measurements of the internal motions of proteins and                   calculations of protein motion based on molecular dynamics.                     The experiments will use both absorption and emission                           anisotropy techniques to study orientational correction                         functions and order parameters.  The aim is to provide a                        definite set of measurements against which to match current                     simulation techniques and assess the adequacy of the                            potential model.  In addition, complementary simulations of                     carefully chosen proteins including solvent will be carried                     out.                                                                                                                                                            The internal motions of protein molecules have generated much                   interest in recent years because of their possible                              significance in protein function.  A variety of techniques                      for the study of protein dynamics have been developed.                          Improvements in time resolved spectroscopy and computers are                    extending the time scale of both experiment and simulation so                   that it is beginning to be possible to make direct                              comparisions.  The major aim of Dr. Fleming's research is to                    make these comparisions in as clear and direct a way as                         possible.//",
