 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to modernize and improve freshman and          sophomore biology and chemistry laboratories on the three campuses of a         remote two-year college that enrolls large numbers of Native Americans,         many of whom are female.  The new equipment being incorporated into the         teaching program includes plant growth chambers, marine aquaria and             computer-interfaced physiology instrumentation.  The environmental              chambers enhance the school's ability to conduct General Biology                laboratory experiments involving plant competition and animal                   metabolism.  The salt-water aquaria are used to expose General Biology          students (most of whom are completely unfamiliar with the ocean) to             marine invertebrates.  The computer-interfaced physiology instrumenta-          tion vastly improves second-year students' opportunities to collect             data that quantify the adaptive responses of animals to varying                 stimuli.                                                                                                                                                             The importance of this instrumentation is that its use in                  undergraduate laboratory instruction provides more effective teaching           of scientific methods for understanding the environment.  A practical           grasp of how scientific methods are used by investigators is important          for both science and non-science majors, and environmental topics hold          a special interest for this audience.                                                                                                                                The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
