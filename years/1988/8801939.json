 "awd_abstract_narration": "Heuristic search is a fundamental problem solving method in artificial          intelligence.  Current algorithm such as A* and IDA*, however, do not           scale up to large problems, due to their focus on finding optimal               solutions.  Removing the optimality constraint should allow the                 development of heuristic search algorithms that can effectively solve           arbitrarily large problems.  The reason is that heuristic evaluation            functions capture the long-range strategic component of problem                 solutions, while the discrepancy between heuristic estimates and actual         costs is primarily a short-range or tactical phenomenon.  Thus, an              algorithm with a sufficiently wide search horizon should be able to cope        with error in the heuristic function.                                                                                                                           A two-pronged attach on this problem is proposed.  The first is the             development of real-time search algorithms that run in constant time and        can commit to actions based on limited information or computation.  The         second is the development of parallel search algorithms in an attempt to        significantly extend the search horizons achievable by such algorithms.         Parallel tree-search algorithms should generalize to arbitrary tree-            recursive programs, such as those generated by divide-and-conquer               algorithms.",
