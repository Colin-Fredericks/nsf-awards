The topic of the conference is \"Almost                       Everywhere Convergence in Probability and Ergodic Theory.\"  There               has been considerable progress on the problems in this area in                  recent years, including Peterson's proof of Bergelson's                         conjecture and Bourgain's work on the ergodic theorem for                       subsequences.  Bourgain will be one of the main speakers.  The                  conference welcomes interested mathematicians, including graduate               students, and inquiries should be addressed to Professor G. A.                  Edgar, Mathematics Department, Ohio State University.  It is                    planned to have a volume of the proceedings of the conference,                  with the papers in it to be refereed.                                                Almost everywhere convergence has interest and applications                in several fields of mathematics, including Modern Analysis,                    Probability Theory, and in particular in Stochastic Processes.",
