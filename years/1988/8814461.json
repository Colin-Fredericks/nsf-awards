 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project deals with a novel approach to conceptual                      design with the potential for decreasing the design and                         manufacturing costs at the same time increasing design                          productivity.  Traditionally, products are designed for                         functionality without much regard for the manufacturability.                    By providing manufacturability information up front, it may be                  possible to develop better designs which would result in                        decreasing manufacturing costs. Comparative initial designs                     will be developed using functionality and                                       functionability/manufacturability respectively, as inputs                       to access the relative cost and effectiveness of these                          methods to produce products.  The problem under consideration                   will be restricted to the design of injection molded structural                 parts.  The approach if successful, would provide the road to                   concurrent product and process design.",
