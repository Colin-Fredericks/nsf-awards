 "awd_abstract_narration": "Working in a Disabled Citizens Computer Center, which will be part of           the National Education Special Alliance established by Apple Computer, a        team will develop and test modified educational software for use by             visually-handicapped individuals.  Under the direction of experienced           staff loaned by the American Printing House for the Blind (APH),                existing educational software from the Minnesota Educational Computing          Center will be modified to give speech/auditory output.  Much of the            work of conversion will be done by students in computer classes from the        Louisville Central High School Computer Technology Career Magnet                Program; the educational opportunity provided for these students is an          important element of the program.  Teachers will be trained to use the          materials and will test its utility in practice.  Dissemination of              finished materials and recommended methods of use will be through the           Apple sponsored network and APH.                                                                                                                                Cost sharing by the partners will total 31% of the NSF funding.",
