 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy is being introduced into the            chemistry curriculum.  The project centers on a modern FTIR                     spectrometer, FTIR accessories, and a dedicated microcomputer.  The             equipment is being used with old experiments as well as with new ones           designed to illustrate modern infrared spectroscopy.  Students from the         introductory laboratory courses to the advanced, integrated laboratory          courses and thesis research projects are using the FTIR instrument.  It         is likely that it will become the chemistry department's most heavily           used spectrometer, replacing three unreliable vacuum-tube instruments.          With the FTIR, students are able to characterize unknowns and                   synthesized materials faster and with greater confidence.  Studies of           \"real world\" samples are being facilitated as well as the investigation         of reaction rates and molecular structure.  Since FTIR methods are              finding increased use in government, industrial and academic                    laboratories, students are better prepared to enter the workforce,              graduate schools, and professional schools because of this project.                                                                                             The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.",
