 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acid rain has become a major concern during the past                       decade.  Rain has a natural acidity due to dissolved carbon                     dioxide.  The acidity of rain is made even greater by the                       emission of certain gases from human endeavors.  Coal burning                   power plants emit substantial quantities of sulfur dioxide and                  high temperature combustion processes, such as automobile                       engines, yield nitrogen oxides.  These gases are eventually                     converted into acids.  A description of the chemical processes                  involved in changing these gases into acids and the speed of                    these reactions are important keys to understanding the                         geographic distribution of acid rain and the impact of                          particular sources of the precursor gases.                                           Sulfur dioxide dissolves into water droplets which provide                 a chemical medium for the oxidation of sulfur dioxide into                      acid.  A vital species in this reaction is hydrogen peroxide.                   It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms by which                 hydrogen peroxide is formed and destroyed in the atmosphere.                    Hydrogen peroxide is highly soluble and is known to have                        deleterious effects on plants.  In contrast to the gas phase                    chemistry of hydrogen peroxide, the chemistry in droplets is                    not well understood.                                                                 This project focuses on examining the aqueous chemistry of                 hydrogen peroxide with emphasis on laboratory studies of the                    reactions that form and destroy hydrogen peroxide under                         conditions approximating those found in cloudwater.  The                        chemistry will be investigated by the technique of                              radiolysis in synthetic precipitation, i. e., aqueous solutions                 of known composition approximating that of cloudwater.  These                   laboratory studies will provide data to test the applicability                  of various models of cloud chemistry.",
