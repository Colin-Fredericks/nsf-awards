 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Science and Mathematics Education Institute of California State             University, Long Beach proposes to identify and select 30 high-ability          youngsters entering grades 9-10 and involve them in a 2-part program            focusing on ocean science.  In the program, ocean science serves as a           vehicle for addressing all the sciences and selected aspects of                 engineering.  Phase I provides 3 1/2 weeks in residence on the CSULB            campus, followed by a 3-day field excursion on Catalina Island.  During         the summer, students will also study how science operates, culminating          in a research project which continues into the subsequent school year.          A key feature of this phase places each student at the side of a                working scientist or engineer, to devote at least one day \"shadowing            the scientist\".  Team teaching involving scientists from the                    university, industry and Jr./Sr. High School teachers will be used.                                                                                             In the follow-up phase during the subsequent school year, students              continue their research within a network which provides a variety of            support services.  Six Saturday follow-up sessions continue their               exploration of a broad variety of science and engineering                       possibilities, as well as nurture their continuing research.",
