 "awd_abstract_narration": "A common feature of many convective storms is growth by                    cloud and cell unions. Although  convective cloud evolution has                 been the subject of a number of empirical and numerical studies,                documentation of the manner in which mergers take place and their               role in storm development is limited.                                                The objective of this research  is the evolution of                        convective storms. Specifically, (1) to identify the ways in                    which clouds and cells join and the dependence of the mode of                   merger on the stages, horizontal proximity and relative motion of               the cloud (cell) pair, and (2) to ascertain the effect of the                   type of merger on subsequent cloud (cell) morphology and history.                    Existing reflectivity data from 10-cm radars will be used.                 Objective and interactive computer techniques will be employed in               many phases of the study.                                                            The results will provide detailed descriptions of this                     important phenomenon from which hypotheses may be developed for                 numerical and observational experiments.  It will also be                       valuable for improvement of techniques for short range prediction               of convective storms based on real-time radar information, which                will soon be available in the national network.",
