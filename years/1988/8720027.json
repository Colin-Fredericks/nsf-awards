 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will allow Dr. Webster and his colleagues to                       continue archaeological research in the Copan Valley, Honduras.                 Test pits will be placed in a number of areas within the site and               obsidian tools and waste flakes collected.  Using a hydration                   technique, it is possible to date when flaking occurred and thus                the team will be able to make chronological determinations.                                                                                                     Copan is one of the major precolumbian cities of Central America                and has been studied by archaeologists for many years. With                     previous NSF support, Dr. Webster has conducted an archaeological               survey of the region and has determined how the population was                  distributed during different periods of time. Ceramic materials                 provide the basis of dating and in most cases work well. During                 one interval however, these ceramics do not change enough to                    serve as sensitive time indicators. Thus the team must turn to                  obsidian and hydration analysis.                                                                                                                                The long-term goal of this research is to understand the roles of               demography, trade and subsistence in the rise and subsequent fall               of the Mayan empire.  Dr. Webster has substantial experience in                 this region and with this type of research.  Investigation into                 the origin and nature of early cities is one of the primary areas               of new anthropological research.",
