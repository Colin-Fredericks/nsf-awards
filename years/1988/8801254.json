 "awd_abstract_narration": "A single chip implementation of a maximum likelihood Viterbi decoder is         being studied for use with convolutional codes and trellis coded                modulation.  The actual final design and fabrication will occur in              Phase III.  The decoder is matched to all codes with up to 64 states            with the property that branches connect any state in the trellis to at          most 4 new states.  This decoder chip will have extensive applications          in digital communication systems and in digital recording systems               including magnetic, magneto-optic and optical systems.                          This chip is expected to be of use in high-speed telephone-line modems,         satellite communication, and magnetic recording applications.  The              maximum-likelihood decoder will significantly reduce the incidence of           channel induced errors in the information bit stream, which was                 previously convolutionally encoded.  While the convolutional encoder is         easy to implement, the dynamic programming algorithm which constitutes          the Viterbi decoder is much more difficult and is thus a very                   significant contribution.",
