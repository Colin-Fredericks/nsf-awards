 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new method for peptide sequencing will be developed involving                 negative ion mass spectrometry.  Negative chemical ionization                   mass spectrometry (NCI-MS) can provide the dramatic enhancement                 in sensitivity necessary to keep pace with the mechanical and                   engineering improvements in automated protein sequencing.  For                  molecules which are strongly electron-capturing, NCI-MS has been                reported to have detection limits in the femtomole to attomole                  (10-18) range.  Because of the selectivity of the ionization                    process, background noise is diminished, further enhancing signal               to noise ratio.  The proposed research will involve exploring a                 variety of electron-capturing phenylisothiocyanate (PITC)                       derivatives by NCI-MS and demonstrate a highly sensitive                        detection method for use in protein and peptide sequencing.                     protein sequencing is important for an understanding of the roles               of modified amino acids in protein structure and to provide                     probes for cloning genes as well as to deliminate the boundaries                of DNA segments coding for proteins.  This instrument                           development proposal seeks also to be able to work with far                     smaller amounts of material than current efforts in                             microchemistry.",
