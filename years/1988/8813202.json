Theoretical and applied mechanics is a well-established field which             includes among others, turbulence, hypersonic and transonic flow,               magneto-hydrodynamics, dynamic plasticity, biomechanics, geophysics,            fracture mechanics and composites.  US has been allotted a                      significant portion of the invited and contributed papers in these              topics.  The US National Committee on Theoretical and Applied                   Mechanics, which is part of the National Research Council, will                 administer a travel grant program for US participants using this NSF            award as well as funds from the Army Research Office, Office of Naval           Research and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.",
