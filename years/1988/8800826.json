 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research continues the investigators inquiries into the              role of computers and information in productivity growth. The                   studies include work on the sources of postwar growth of                        information activity, on computer-based technology,occupational                 mix and productivity growth, and information flows, trade and                   productivity convergence among nations.The work relies on                       extensive data bases collected, in part, by the investigators'                  past work, and in part from collections at the U.S. Government                  Bureau of Economic Analysis and other extant data sets.  The                    research on sources of growth asks to what extent the relative                  rise in employment in information services represents a                         redeployment of the labor force away from manufacturing where                   productivity increases have reduced the demand for labor. The                   study on occupational mix explores whether computer technology has              resulted in an increased level of education and technical                       expertise in the labor force or has been de-skilling.  The study                on trade explores the role of information transmission and                      technology diffusion on economic development of nations.",
