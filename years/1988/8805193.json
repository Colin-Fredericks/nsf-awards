 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant continues support for studies of the solar wind                 interaction with non-magnetic solar system bodies such as Venus,                Mars, and comets.  Research in this area contributes to a broader               and comparative understanding of solar-planetary, and solar-                    terrestrial, relations in general.  Solar-terrestrial physics is                the study of how the sun affects the terrestrial/planetary                      environment.  Solar radiation, in both the visible and                          ultraviolet regions of the spectrum, is the most obvious means of               interaction between the sun and the planets, but we now recognize               that the solar wind also strongly influences the upper                          atmospheres, ionospheres, and magnetospheres of the earth and                   planets.  The physical environment of each of the planets is                    different and accordingly each planetary environment interacts                  differently with the solar wind.  Studying these interactions                   collectively -- the subject of comparative magnetospheres --                    increases nonlinearly the amount to be learned and the quality of               our understanding.                                                                   The work planned here will transfer the knowledge gained on                the Venusian Atmosphere to that of Mars.  In particular, the                    ionosphere of Mars will be modelled.",
