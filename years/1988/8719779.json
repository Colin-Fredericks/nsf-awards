 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a growing need for new classes of models for systems                   constructed from modules of interacting discrete events such as                 manufacturing systems, communication networks or computer operating             systems.  Such models are also needed for systems described by                  continuous variables supervised by computer-based controllers which             alter their actions when they are triggered by certain discrete                 events.  These models are called discrete event models or DEMs.                                                                                                 This proposal introduces a new class of discrete event models called            Finitely Recursive Processes (FRP).  These models are motivated by              problems in supervisory control while some of the formal structure is           based on Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes.                                                                                                            PI proposes research in four directions.  First, consolidate and                extend the descriptive power of FRPs.  This research is relatively              straightforward since his work so far has concentrated on the                   descriptive power of FRPs.  Second, investigate how FRPs can be used            to assist in the implementation of supervisory control.  He proposes            to develop a LISP-based scheme for doing this,  Third, extend FRPs so           that they can be used for the performance evaluation of discrete event          systems.  This will require embedding FRPs in a real-time environment.          For this purpose, he proposes to augment the fundamental notions of             events and processes in FRPs with real-time attributes following the            work of Knuth on attribute grammars.  Fourth, develop a supervisory             control for a complex, real-world application.",
