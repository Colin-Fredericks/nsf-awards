 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research, being supported by the Organic and                               Macromolecular Chemistry Program, will develop the technique of                 flash vacuum pyrolysis (FVP) as a source of reactive                            intermediates that will permit the synthesis of a number of                     unusual structures.  FVP permits the rapid assembly of complex                  molecules from relatively inexpensive starting materials in a                   reduced number of steps.                                                                                                                                        This program will develop reactions of o-quinodimethanes and                    other reactive molecules that will be of use in the synthesis                   of complex organic molecules.  Specific objectives include the                  development of:  (a) reaction sequences involving                               o-quinodimethanes derived from the ferrocene and other metal                    pi-complexed ring systems which lead to stable organometallic                   compounds and nonorganometallic derivatives of them; (b)                        reaction sequences which start from the furan adduct of                         methylenecyclobutenone and lead to functionalized fused ring                    systems; (c) reaction sequences involving intramolecular                        reactions of bis-2,5-dimethylene-2,5-dihydrofurans that lead to                 cyclophanes and derivatives of them; (d) reaction sequences                     involving quinodimethanes with extended pi systems that lead to                 cyclophanes and other ring systems; and (e) a general reaction                  for the conversion of omega-halo N,N-dialkyl-amides to                          omega-formylnitriles.  The project includes the following types                 of studies:  (a) the preparation of novel reactive molecules                    such as o-quinodimethanes derived from less common aromatic                     systems; (b) study of the chemistry of selected reactive                        molecules; (c) development of \"protected\" forms of reactive                     molecules that will allow them to be handled more conveniently;                 and (d) development of pyrolytic reactions that involve unusual                 fragmentations or rearrangements.  This project should result                   in reactions which have unique specificities and can be used to                 prepare ferrocenes and other metal pi-complexed ring systems,                   functionalized fused ring systems, cyclophanes, medium and                      large carbocycles and heterocycles, and omega-formylnitriles.",
