 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Late Cretaceous and Early Tertiary periods are critical             times in the history of the flowering plants.  Information about                evolutionary changes during this period has come from the study                 of leaves, pollen, and most recently, flowers, fruits, and seeds.               Although fossil, petrified woods of flowering plants occur                      throughout deposits in the United States, there have been few                   systematic studies of their anatomy.  Dr. Elisabeth Wheeler of                  North Carolina State University will study the anatomy and                      taxonomic relationships of several collections of Cretaceous and                Tertiary woods, to extend our understanding of the history of                   particular plant groups.  Data on the structural characteristics                of the woods examined during the study and data from the                        literature will be organized into a computer database.  Changes                 in wood structure through time will be tracked, and compared with               changes in other plant parts.                                                           The success of this project is dependent to a large degree              on access to a database with information on the wood anatomy of a               large number of living species.  Such a database has been                       established at North Carolina State and will be expanded.  This                 expansion will facilitate the comparison of fossil woods to                     extant plants, and will be of benefit to anyone needing to                      identify wood samples of both living and fossil plants.",
