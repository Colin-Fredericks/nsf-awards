 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor Dennis D. Focht of the                        University of California in collaboration with Dr. Blanca                       Hernandez of the University of Panama, for the purpose of                       isolating bacteria that metabolize biphenyl compounds. Bacteria                 will be isolated from the untreated industrial and domestic                     waste canals of Panama City, Panama, where a great diversity of                 such organisms has been found.  Isolation of a wide variety of                  biphenyl-metabolizing bacteria may lead to efficient                            combinations capable of degrading even polychlorinated biphenyls                (PCBs) in the environment.                                                                                                                                      Polychlorinated biphenyls are widespread contaminants in the                    global ecosystem and represent a potential hazard in dump sites                 in industrialized countries.  Biodegradation represents an                      alternative strategy to incineration of PCB-contaminated soils.                 To date, bacteria using PCBs as growth substrates have not been                 isolated and probably do not exist in nature.  Nevertheless,                    considerable progress has been made in selectively isolating                    bacteria that use biphenyl as a growth substrate.  These                        bacteria partially metabolize PCBs by isolating part of the                     enzyme system while growing on biphenyl, the non-chlorinated                    analog.  By combining Professor Focht's expertise with                          biodegradation, with access to a rich and varied sample of                      microorganisms, this project enhances the capability of research                scientists in a developing country and is of mutual benefit,                    thus fulfilling an important criterion of the Science in                        Developing Countries Program.",
