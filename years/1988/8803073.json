 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the application of Einstein's                        General Theory of Relativity to a theoretical investigation of                  systems with non-Newtonian gravitational forces.  Electric                      forces are due to charged particles and are responsible for the                 orbiting electron structure of atoms and molecules; the                         gravitational analog is the attractive force of gravity.                        Magnetic forces are due to the motion of charges in current                     loops.  They display a much richer variety of effects.  Their                   gravitational analogs, which arise from the motion of massive                   objects, were unknown to Newton but are predicted by Einstein's                 theory.  One aspect of this research is the exploration of                      possible roles these forces play in astronomical systems.                       Light and radio waves constitute a combination of electric and                  magnetic forces into a wave.  The same is true of their                         gravitational analogs which again are predicted by Einstein's                   theory.  A major portion of this project involves the study of                  the properties of these gravitational waves, such as their                      energy content, their quantum properties analogous to the                       photon composition of light and the way they are produced by                    stars and galaxies.                                                                  This highly mathematical work should improve our                           understanding of black holes, gravitational radiation, and the                  proper construction of a consistent quantum theory of gravity.",
