 "awd_abstract_narration": "They propose a series of experiments and computer simulations                   which will help to clarify the nature of the glass transition and               help to elucidate the properties of the glass state itself.  They               will use their recently developed specific heat spectrometer to                 investigate the shape and temperature dependence of the                         distribution of relaxation times that appear above glass                        transitions.  The data will be interpreted in light of the                      Kauzmann criterion for where the specific heat anomaly can occur.               Their computer simulations and nonlinear susceptibility studies                 are aimed at finding a length scale associated with the glassy                  relaxation.  They also plan to study the secondary relaxations                  that occur in glasses below Tg and the low temperature specific                 heat of the same glasses to see if they can be related to one                   another by some current theories of the glassy state.  They will                also measure the x-ray diffraction of Arsenic (II) Selenide to be               used in conjunction with neutron diffraction measurements to                    determine the partial structure factors of this glass.",
