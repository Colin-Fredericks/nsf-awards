 "awd_abstract_narration": "In some species, some mature individuals, called helpers,               assist others in raising young rather than reproduce themselves.                Studies of such cooperative breeding have been extremely                        productive in the development of theory related to the                          evolutionary basis of social behavior in animals.  This research                will test a general theory known as habitat saturation, which                   relates group formation to retention of young in an environment                 in which opportunities for dispersal are limited.  The                          investigators propose that individuals which remain in their                    natal group as helpers rather than disperse are practicing a                    strategy for acquiring high quality territories.  The species                   they are studying is unique in constructing cavities in living                  pine trees, and the investigators propose that birds seek to                    acquire territories with existing cavities rather than expend the               great time and energy required to construct cavities in areas not               previously occupied.                                                                    Previous research showed that the behavior of this species              is consistent with this hypothesis.  Individuals that serve as                  helpers become breeders by replacing previous breeders in the                   immediate vicinity of their natal territory.  Some inherit natal                territory, others move to adjacent groups.  In contrast,                        individuals that do not serve as helpers, that is, disperse after               fledging, wander and may move to territories far from their natal               site.  This research will test the hypothesis about the                         ecological basis of habitat saturation and territory quality by                 constructing cavities in unoccupied habitat.  It is predicted                   that birds will occupy these territories once cavities are                      present.                                                                                In conducting this research, the investigators will monitor             over 500 banded adults each year.  These data provide one of the                best demographic samples available for any bird.  This is                       particularly important because the red-cockaded woodpecker is a                 federally endangered species endemic to the United States, and                  its population dynamics are of great concern.  This experiment,                 if successful, will provide the first known means by which                      populations of this rare bird can be increased through                          management.",
