 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry                       Program, is in the area of gas phase chemical kinetics.  It                     involves the study of the reactions of polyatomic free radicals                 with halogen containing diatomic molecules, such as HI, HBr,                    and I2.  The reactions will be studied using a heated tubular                   quartz reactor coupled to a photoionization mass spectrometer.                  Excimer laser photolysis will be employed to produce the                        polyatomic free radicals.                                                       This research will provide new knowledge of the dynamics of                     important elementary reactions and provide more accurate                        determinations of the thermodynamic properties, such as                         enthalpies of formation, of the free radicals studied.  This                    information will be of great interest for the modeling of                       combustion processes, for the reliable prediction of the                        thermochemical properties of reactive species, and for                          determining plausible reaction mechanisms where knowledge of                    the potential energy along competing reaction paths is                          essential.",
