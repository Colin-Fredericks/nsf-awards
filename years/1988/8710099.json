 "awd_abstract_narration": "Virtually all animals undergo marked changes in body structure,                 function and behavior which enable them to adapt to, and survive,               the hardships of a seasonally changing natural environment.  The                overall goal of the program is to understand the regulation of                  seasonal reproduction in an animal of world-wide importance, the                domestic sheep.  It has become clear through recent research that               the process of seasonal reproduction in sheep is generated                      spontaneously by a self-sustained endogenous rhythm of                          neuroendocrine activity.  Changes in day length provide time cues               which permit appropriate phasing of this endogenous rhythm with                 cyclic changes in the environment.  The specific goal of the                    research program is to define those portions of the annual cycle                of day length which provide the temporal information leading to                 an appropriately timed breeding season, and to clarify the                      mechanisms by which this information is conveyed.  The outcome of               the research should lead to new insights into a fundamental                     problem of enormous biological significance and practical                       importance: the regulation of fertility.  The results will also                 be more broadly applicable to a wide variety of physiological,                  metabolic and behavioral rhythms which form an integral part of                 the adaptive mechanisms in many animals.  An understanding of                   these processes should have profound implications to the                        production of food and human nutrition as well as the                           reproductive biology of wild or endangered species that are                     seasonal breeders.",
