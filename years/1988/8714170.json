 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will investigate the biogeochemical               cycle of dimethylsulfide (DMS) in seawater.  The ocean is a                     major source of biogenic reduced sulfur to the global                           atmosphere, at a level roughly equivalent to anthropogenic SO2                  emissions.  DMS accounts for some 90% of the marine biogenic                    sulfur flux.  The objective of this investigation is to                         elucidate the rates, pathways, and processes involved in the                    formation, transformation, and consumption of DMS in the ocean.                 This biogeochemical information is vital to understanding the                   DMS concentration profiles which have been observed in the                      field and may influence future sampling strategies.  One a                      larger scale, a fuller understanding of the marine                              biogeochemistry of DMS and the processes involved in DMS                        cycling in seawater will aid in defining the relationship                       between oceanic biogeochemical processes and the production of                  the volatile biogenic sulfur compound which plays a major role                  in the global atmospheric sulfur cycle.                                                 Four working hypotheses will be addressed:  1) Degradation              of algal dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP, the DMS precursor)                   and release of DMS is the result of normal metabolic processes                  by phytoplankton;  2) release of DMS results form physiological                 stress on the phytoplankton;  3) microbial degradation of DMSF-                 containing algal material is a source of DMS in seawater;  4)                   microbial degradation is a sink of DMS in seawater.  The                        approach to assessing these hypotheses will combine laboratory                  and field incubation experiments.  Laboratory studies will be                   conducted under controlled environmental conditions and using                   selected individual and mixed culture algal and bacterial                       species.  Experimental conditions will be varied to examine                     specific factors which may be important in DMS cycling.  Field                  studies will then be used to examine the processes under                        natural conditions.",
