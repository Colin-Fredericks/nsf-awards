 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the Andrews ecosystems research                 group in the acquisition of an integrated information processing                system that combines 1) on-line storage of the Forest Science                   Data Bank (FSDB), 2) a SUN 3/280 graphics workstation, and 3) a                 local area network (Ethernet LAN) linking the SUN workstation and               FSDB with existing personal computers of the Andrews ecosystem                  research group.  An on-line data bank is essential for the future               success of the integrated forest research program.  An on-line                  data bank will promote more efficient use of existing data and                  facilitate prompt documentation and storage of data currently                   being gathered.  The LAN will allow high-speed access to the data               bank by Andrews researchers in three University departments                     (Forest Science, Fisheries and Wildlife, and Entomology) and the                US Forest Service.  The LAN also allows harddisks, laser                        printers, and plotters to be shared among users, greatly                        multiplying computing power.  The LAN provides electronic file                  and message transfer among researchers, and also among sites via                the OSU campus network as well as existing national and                         international networks.  The workstation, with its high-                        resolution graphics, will be used to study pattern and process at               the landscape and other levels of spatial resolution.  A                        geographic information system (GIS) will be the main tool for                   these studies.  The workstation will also allow scientists to                   work efficiently with more complex models than are available now,               and to use a new breed of exploratory statistical techniques.                           The ecosystems research group comprises scientists with a               noteworthy record of research.  Further enhancement of their                    collective productivity will be expected with the new computer                  system.  Institutional facilities are excellent and cost sharing                is significant.                                                                         The Ecosystem Studies Program recommends enthusiastically               that this award be made.",
