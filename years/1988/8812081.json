 "awd_abstract_narration": "The role of calcium ions as a second messenger in the control of                flagellar beat will be examined.  The major objective of the proposed           experiments is to identify, using biochemical procedures, calcium-              binding proteins in the flagellar axoneme that may be involved in               controlling the shape of flagellar bends.  Biochemical fractionation of         axonemes isolated from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii will be carried out to         determine the sub-axonemal distribution of calmodulin (CaM), which has          been implicated in the control of flagellar beat.  The distribution of          CaM-binding proteins in the axoneme will be monitored by gel overlay            procedures using 125-I-CaM or biotinylated CaM and avidin-peroxidase.           Outer doublet microtubules will be prepared from axonemes to determine          whether these structures contain CaM, CaM-binding proteins, or other            calcium binding proteins of interest.  Finally, polyclonal antisera             directed against a specific CaM-binding protein will be prepared and            used in immunolabelling studies to examine the distribution of this             \"candidate\" protein wthin the axoneme and the outer doublet                     microtubules.                                                                                                                                                   These studies should clarify the mechanisms by which calcium alters             flagellar waveform by identifying key calcium-binding proteins that may         control flagellar shape, as well as generally broaden our understanding         of processes that involve calcium as a second messenger.",
