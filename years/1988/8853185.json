 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project permits students to study issues of parallel                    computation and parallel processing in a flexible, reconfigurable               laboratory.                                                                                                                                                        As parallel processing becomes increasingly important in computing,          students of computer science need to be exposed to facilities that will         allow them to explore, in depth, the concepts and limitations of                different parallel computational models. The parallel computation               laboratory that supports this project is equipped with six (6) parallel         processing machines. Each machines contains eight (8) processors which          may be connected in a variety of ways including a ring, a pipeline,             shuffle-exchange and hypercube. The six parallel machines are                   connected to one network server allowing the 48 processors to be                integrated as one large \"supercomputer\". Student access to the                  parallel equipment configuration is via six high efficiency                     wokstations suitable for parallel-program development and debugging.                                                                                               By being exposed to different parallel computer configurations,              students in this project are prepared for an area of computing that is          becoming increasingly important both as a practical and research topic.
