 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this work is to provide a rigorous basis for ascertaining           whether or not a given set of software requirements is internally               complete.  This will require determining the types of individual                requirements that are necessary to provide complete functional and              performance specifications along with a formal notation that will allow         the development of rules of inference and closure criteria for derived          requirements.  This problem is important both for economic and safety           reasons.  The high cost and difficulty of correction requirements               specification errors in the later stages of the software development            process implies that great leverage can be obtained by methods that             help to find problems early.  Also, a large number of software-related          accidents can be traced to requirements problems, and incompleteness in         terms of requirements is often a casual factor.  Furthermore, formal            analysis of safe software behavior cannot be guaranteed by testing              alone; analysis of the specified behavior of the system is necessary            and this is not possible if the behavioral specification is incomplete.         Emphasis will be placed on aspects of software requirements                     specification that have not previously been adequately handled                  including timing abstractions, the man/machine interface, and                   robustness.",
