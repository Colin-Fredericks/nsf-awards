 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. C. L. Liu, Department of             Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, to                pursue with Professor H. W. Leong, Department of Information                    Systems and Computer Science, National University of Singapore, for             a period of 24 months, a program of research on computer aided                  design of very large scale integrated circuits (VLSI).  The                     collaborators will develop design models that accurately describe               the constraints and requirements of the physical design process.                They also will be concerned with improving design methodologies.                Their research will be directed toward the goal of solving design               problems and developing new design tools to handle the extremely                complex VLSI circuits.                                                                                                                                          The research problem, while theoretical in nature, may impact                   favorably on the semiconductor industries in the United States and              Singapore.  This research could assist semiconductor industries in              solving today's design problems and, also, could produce new design             tools for the future.  Drs. Liu and Leong are highly respected                  scientists with a record of successful collaboration in the field               of this project.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the             Science in Developing Countries Program which seeks to increase the             level of cooperation between U.S. scientists and engineers and                  their counterparts in developing countries through the exchange of              scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through               collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.",
