 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most naturally occurring processes are inherently nonlinear and can             give rise to very complex behaviors.  Even very simple mathematical             models can exhibit behavior gives rise to extremely convoluted (and             often very beautiful) fractal shapes.  The discovery of this                    fundamentally new area of mathematics has been crucially dependent on           computationally intensive graphic methods and has given birth to a              radically new paradigm for mathematical research:  experimental                 mathematics.  Though this material is at the frontier of current                research, it is accessible to high school students, and the graphic             images that are generated through its investigation are highly                  informative and often of uncommon visual richness and beauty.                   Mathematical materials and associated computer software aimed at                motivating and empowering high school students of average mathematical          ability to perform experimental mathematical investigations will be             designed, developed, and evaluated.  The mathematical content will              comprise fractals, nonlinear dynamics, and mathematical chaos.                  Fundamental mathematical concepts will be applied to a wide variety of          physical, biological and social processes (e.g. population growth,              problems in epidemiology, and the economics of the arms race).  The             deep connection between geometry and nonlinear dynamics will be made            explicit by developing computer-based tools that will enable students           to generate fractal maps and pictures of compelling complexity and                                                                                              beauty.  Finally, through their work in experimental mathematics                                                                                                students will acquire a deeper understanding of mathematical                                                                                                    and scientific thinking.",
