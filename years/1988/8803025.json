 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a cooperative research project on                           high-temperature superconductors to be conducted by                             Prof. Herman Fink of the University of California at                            Davis and two researchers at the Atomic Center in                               Bariloche, Argentina: Dr. Arturo Lopez-Davalos, Solid                           State Theory Group, and Dr. Francisco De La Cruz of                             the Low Temperature Laboratory. They will investigate                           the properties of high-temperature superconductors and                          the magnetic and critical current properties of                                 superconducting micronetworks. On the theoretical                               side, they will study the effect of the inclusion of a                          small coherence length (coherent electron pairs are                             the basis for superconductivity) in the fundamental                             Ginzburg-Landau equations. Such theoretical                                     interpretation is urgently needed in view of the                                explosion in experimental results produced world-wide                           since the discovery of nitrogen-temperature                                     superconductivity. In addition, they will study the                             magnetic properties and the critical currents (the                              most severe limitation of these materials is low                                critical current) of ladder networks and square                                 lattice arrays.                                                                                                                                                 The work on superconductivity at Bariloche is of high                           quality and the collaboration with Prof. Fink will                              strengthen that effort. The Argentinian group brings                            vast experience in the properties of superconductors                            and has made many contributions to the literature in                            this field. Previous collaborative work has been                                highly productive.",
