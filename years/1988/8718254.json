 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, two anthropologists will interview a sample of                 middle-class Americans about their perceptions of cultural                      differences.  The research objective is to describe the models                  used to understand and explain diferences between themselves                    and people living beyond US borders - people commonly defined                   as \"Non-Western\", underdeveloped or \"Third World\".  The methods                 used to analyze this cultural idea system will include the                      examination of photographic images of Asians, Africans, and                     Latin Americans found in popular magazines; these pictures will                 be treated both as sources of information for magazine readers                  and as cultural artifacts reflecting the beliefs of the                         publishing society.  The project will also interview a sample                   of individuals intensively on their ideas about foreigners.  A                  cultural model of ethnocentrism will be created from these                      sources of information.                                                                                                                                         This project is important because it will help us understand                    ethnocentrism as it exists in the USA.  This country has always                 been described as less knowledgeable about foreigners than any                  other major Western nation.  As the world economic situation                    changes and US citizens have to accomodate to more powerful                     foreign nations, we need to understand our own perceptions and                  reactions to them.  This research will advance this                             understanding.",
