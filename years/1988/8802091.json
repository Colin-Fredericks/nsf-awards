 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many foreign agents form covalent adducts with DNA.  These                 lesions are removed by nucleotide excision repair systems such                  as the UvrABC endonuclease system of E. coli.  The mechanism                    and efficiency of repair may depend on the DNA structure at the                 site of the lesion.  Using homogeneous substrates specifically                  modified with a psoralen monoadduct or crosslink, DNA                           sequences and helix conformation will be related to the in                      vitro efficiency of DNA repair.  Protein DNA complexes and                      intermediate products will be analyzed in order to formulate                    biochemical mechanisms of repair.  It is proposed to test                       whether the rate of repair of a crosslink depends on the DNA                    conformation; whether fast repair is due to rapid incision by                   UvrABC endonuclease and whether slow repair may form a high                     affinity UvrAB-lesion nucleoprotein complex which promotes                      subsequent slower steps such as recombinational repair.                              Nucleotide Excision DNA repair is a natural cellular                       defense mechanism by which a cell, using multienzyme complexes                  rids itself of a variety of lesions in its DNA.  A feature in                   common among these DNA lesions may be a distortion of the local                 DNA conformation which becomes attractive to the nucleotide                     excision repair enzymes, allowing this enzyme system to exhibit                 a broad range of substrate specificity.  In more complex DNA                    lesions repair may also require the participation of DNA                        recombinant enzymes.  Dr. Yeung will study the repair of                        psoralen-DNA monoadducts and crosslinks in purified system                      using a number of repair enzymes and defined DNA substrates in                  order to better understand the mechanism of this important                      cellular process.",
