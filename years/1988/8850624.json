 "awd_abstract_narration": "This prototype project includes, in the first year of operation,                several activities to strengthen minority education at the precollege           level.  It was cooperatively developed by Norfolk State University,             Hampton University, Old Dominion University, and the Cooperative                Hampton Roads Organizations for Minorities in Engineering (CHROME), a           non-profit planning, coordinating, and advocacy organization of higher          education institutions, government agencies, public school systems,             business and industry, and civic and professional associations.  During         the first year, a set of activities, based on science and mathematics           experiences, and designed to nurture, encourage and motivate minority           students are being implemented. These include Saturday Academies of             Science, held at Norfolk State University, Hampton University, and Old          Dominion University, for seventh and eighth grade students conducted            on six successive Saturdays in the fall and repeated again in the               spring.  Forty students are involved in each Academy, for a total               enrollment of 240. Parents are especially urged to attend the                   orientation session at each Academy.  Topics in mathematics, physical           sciences and the life sciences are covered and activities are designed          in a participatory mode.  The culmination of Academy activities will be         a region-wide science fair to be held at Norfolk State University.  A           series of three colloquia designed for precollege teachers, to                  complement the Saturday Academies, are being held- one on each campus           for 40-60 precollege teachers.  The colloquia are sequential in nature          with themes of: Sensitizing Educators to Phobias in Science;                    Innovative Concepts to Promote Interest in Science; and, Future                 Implications for Science. Plans for the second year and beyond will             expand the activities to include the undergraduate level.",
