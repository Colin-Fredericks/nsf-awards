 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research activity is supported under the \"Research Opportunities           for Women--Planning Grant Program\".  The purpose of this program is to          provide an opportunity for women, who have never been the recipient of          a federal award, to undertake preliminary work to determine the                 feasibility of a line of research.  This award will allow the                   investigator to begin to develop and test models to examine male/female         wage differentials and occupational segregation.  The investigator will         pay special attention to the differences in job mobility between men            and women as possible factor in explaining wage differentials.                                                                                                  This line of research in the general area of labor economics is                 extremely important and timely.  There is great controversy over                whether wage differentials between men and women are caused mainly by           discriminatory practices or whether it is mostly a result of other              factors such as differences in human capital, occupational choice,              willingness to relocate, career interruptions, etc.  Whether wage               differentials are due mainly to sex discrimination or other factors is          of enormous importance in determining what public policy ought to be            with respect to employment practices.",
