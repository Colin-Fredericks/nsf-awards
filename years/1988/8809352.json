 "awd_abstract_narration": "Empirical findings from the same data set can change drastically when           the underlying statistical assumptions are changed.  This is because            many econometric procedures can give misleading results when an                 incorrect model is assumed.  One class of models, where it has been             demonstrated that the empirical findings can depend on arbitrary                statistical assumptions, is models where the variable of interest is            the duration of some event such as length of time unemployed.  The              purpose of this project is to carefully study the structure of commonly         used econometric duration-models, in order develop estimation                   strategies that are robust in the sense that few auxiliary assumptions          have to be made for them to have desirable statistical properties.  To          study the usefulness of the estimation strategies, data will be                 generated from a variety of models.  Then estimators will be                    constructed and applied to the data to see whether the true underlying          model can be determined.                                                                                                                                        This project is mainly theoretical, but it will also have important             implications for empirical economic.  When a model is estimated, it is          often necessary to make arbitrary assumptions in order to make the              estimation computationally feasible.  It is then important to                   understand to what extent the results are driven by these assumptions,          and whether the results can be expected to be robust to changes in the          assumptions.  The methods developed in this project will help empirical         researchers perform this task for econometric duration-models.",
