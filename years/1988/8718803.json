 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hamrick and Platt propose to integrate a detailed ecological            analysis of an old growth stand of longleaf pine (Pinus                         palustris) with an equally detailed description of its genetic                  structure.  Starch gel electrophoresis will be used to identify                 several enzyme genes which can be used as genetic markers in the                study of this population.  Once the arrangement of genetic                      variation has been described, Hamrick and Platt will use these                  genetic markers to study those population parameters that                       interact to produce the genetic patterns observed.  By applying                 an analytical technique commonly referred to as paternity                       exclusion  analysis, they will measure pollen and seed movement                 within six localized areas.  They will also use genetic markers                 to assist in the identification of the parents of seedlings and                 samplings.  This information will be used to determine whether                  there is a genetic component to mortality and survival.  Upon the               successful completion of their research, Hamrick and Platt will                 produce a detailed description of the factors which interact to                 shape the genetic and ecological composition of the population.                         This research has several applied aspects.  Studies of gene             movement by pollen and seeds will provide insights into the size                of an effective breeding unit.  This information will be valuable               for the establishment of ecological preserves.  Second, data                    obtained from  this natural old-growth stand can be compared to                 similar data taken from second growth stands which have been                    managed in different ways.  This will allow foresters to                        understand how their management practices impact the genetic                    composition of longleaf pine stands.",
