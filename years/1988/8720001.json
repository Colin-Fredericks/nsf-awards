 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project a graduate student in anthropology will conduct                 ethnographic research in Bogota, Columbia.  The researcher will                 interview street vendors, observe street vending, and get                       information from government agencies and vendor organizations.                                                                                                  The project will investigate the nature of the relationships                    between street vendors (the \"informal\" economy) and public and                  private officials and others in the \"formal\" economy.  The                      research will seek to explain how street vending persists and                   flourishes through its relationships with complementary economic                institutions, and how vendors are able to amass capital.  The                   research will analyze how social position, access to resources,                 and the use of personalized relationships favor capital                         accumulation by vendors.  Vendors will be chosen from three                     districts of the city: a central location, a contraband market in               a poorer section, and a middle-class market for luxuries.                                                                                                       This project is important because the relation between the formal               and informal economies of societies is a critical issue of modern               development.  The informal sector is growing and dynamic in most                countries of the world, yet most economic theory pertains to                    formal sector activity.  This project should help us understand                 these relationships in one developing country.",
