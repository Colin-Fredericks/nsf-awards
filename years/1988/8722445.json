 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. Daniel E. Martire of Georgetown University              for cooperative research in separation processes with Professor                 Ervin Kovats of the Ecole Polytechnique Federal of Lausanne,                    Switzerland.  Their collaboration draws on the respective expertise             of Dr. Martire in theoretical analysis and Prof. Kovats in novel                chemical synthesis, and on their common strength in the measurement             of thermodynamic solution properties by gas-liquid chromatography               (GLC).  The primary objective of their research is to develop more              reliable and quantitative, correlative and predictive methods for               GLC retention, based on sound molecular theory.  They have completed            experimental studies on well-characterized systems, carefully                   selected to display a wide range of molecular chain length and                  interactional effects.  Dr. Martire now plans to apply a novel                  unified theory of chromatography to the theoretical analysis of the             thermodynamic results.  A further objective of their collaboration              is to guide the synthesis of polar and polarizable standard liquid              phases for GLC, based on the Apolane compounds developed in                     Switzerland.                                                                                                                                                    Chromatography is the most important and widely used instrumental               method for the physical separation of mixtures of chemical                      compounds, and ultimately their identification and quantification.              However, much analytical chromatography is still practiced in an                empirical manner, which is both time consuming and often unreliable,            especially when novel separation compounds are encountered.  The                results of this research will promote a more informed and efficient             approach to assessing GLC separations, by guiding the selection or              design of the most effective mobile and stationary phases for a                 given separation.",
