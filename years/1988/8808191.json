During the                twelve month period beginning 1 July 1988, Professor Larter will                carry out research in the area of nonlinear dynamics, specifically              a theoretical investigation into the oscillatory behavior of the                peroxidase-oxidase reaction to determine if that system exhibits                dynamical instability known as chemical chaos and, if so, to                    define the conditions under which this phenomenon is observed.  By              analyzing the complex oscillatory behavior of the peroxidase-                   oxidase reaction, Dr. Larter will seek to discover not only the                 origin of chaotic behavior in that particular system but also a                 general understanding of chaos in chemical oscillators.                                                                                                         This Career Advancement Award will enable Dr. Larter to broaden                 her research activities and to establish a viable, independent                  investigative program that addresses the impact of spatial                      nonuniformities on chemical processes.  The results of this                     research should be broadly important in the chemical sciences and               could also find application in a number of other fields including               solid state physics, meteorology, and even economics.",
