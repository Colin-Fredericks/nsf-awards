 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will allow the researcher, an anthropologist at the                Museum of the American Indian, to study the environmental                       adaptation of the Lubicon Lake Cree of the forest in northern                   Alberta, Canada.  The social organization of the group will be                  analyzed as it relates to their reliance for subsistence on the                 moose, the primary game animal in the area.  Other groups in                    adjacent areas relied upon Moose and other game as well as fish.                These Indians are the last surviving hunting bands in Canada and                have continued a fairly traditional economy.  The study will                    examine scientific, government and missionary records pertaining                to the Cree and their use of game populations, the archives of                  the Hudson's Bay company and other records of the fur trade in                  Winnipeg, and involve ethnographic fieldwork on Cree hunting and                social organization.                                                                                                                                            This project is significant because the researcher will obtain                  information on native subsistence for relatively little cost due                to his extensive previous experience with this group. The Indians               have developed economic strategies that allowed them to survive                 in the fragile arctic environment for many years, and improved                  understanding of these native practices can help more                           industrialized societies survive and prosper in similar                         environments.",
