 "awd_abstract_narration": "The site of Salibiya I, located in Israel, was inhabited by                     Natufian peoples at approximately 9,500 B.C.  Excavations                       conducted there in 1987 by Dr. Crabtree and her colleagues                      yielded a stratified sequence of at least eight distinct Natufian               layers which were rich in both lithic and faunal remains.  Dr.                  Crabtree will analyze the later materials.  She will identify the               animal species present in the Salibiya I faunal assemblage and                  estimate their relative abundances.  For abundant species, such                 as gazelle, she will also determine ages at death.  The data will               be examined to discern possible changes through time, and                       comparisons will be made with other Natufian sites.                                                                                                             The research will examine three questions.  First, what was the                 range of animal species hunted by the Natufians at Salibiya I and               to what extend did they specialize in gazelle hunting?  Second,                 to what degree were the Natufians exerting hunting pressure on                  gazelles and how might this have affected other subsistence                     activities?  Third, can one discern regional and chronological                  variations in Natufian hunting practices?                                                                                                                       This research is important because of the light it may shed on                  the origins of the domestication of plants and animals.  The                    Natufians, although they were hunters and gatherers and not                     herders of domestic animals, lived at a time just prior to when                 this occurred.  Their society shows signs of the increasing                     complexity which accompanies domestication in other parts of the                world, and archaeologists have posited that the processes which                 led to the Neolithic revolution elsewhere were also at work here.               They argue that these Natufians tried to treat gazelles as                      domestic animals but failed because the species is not amenable.                Thus, this may provide a unique instance in which the process                   failed.  Through this study archaeologists may gain insight into                the processes which lead to complex societies such as our own.",
