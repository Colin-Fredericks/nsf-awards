This program has been in           operation since 1949.  Working in their sponsors' laboratories, the             students conduct projects that involve original research within the             scope of their respective sponsors' ongoing research programs.  The             student gain experience in all aspects of  research including designing         a project, implementing the research plan, interpreting data, and               reporting the research results both orally and in writing.  The                 students' research participation experience will be supplemented by             attending meetings of their respective laboratory groups and by after-          dinner research presentations and discussions at the student residence          by sponsors and student.",
