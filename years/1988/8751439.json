 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project intends to offer a six-week summer                         workshop for 28 high school mathematics teachers. The two major                 components of the workshop are courses in discrete mathematics                  and one in probability and statistics, each for four quarter                    hours of credit. In addition to these courses, there is to be a                 seminar devoted to sharing of ideas and the evaluation and                      development of resource materials for use in secondary school                   mathematics classes. Throughout the summer workshop and the                     academic year, microcomputers will be used as tools to teach                    mathematics as the teachers are encouraged to plan ways to use                  computers to make their teaching of these relatively new topics                 more effective.                                                                                                                                                 During the academic year following the workshop there will be                   monthly seminars for the participants. The project staff will                   visit each of the participants at their schools at least twice                  during the year; also, the staff will be available as                           consultants as needed by the participants throughout the year                   to facilitate their learning and application of the                             mathematical concepts of the two major courses that may be new                  to them.                                                                                                                                                        The topics in discrete mathematics, especially elementary                       combinatorics, are important in the considerations of                           curricular revision at the secondary school level. Several                      recommendations to revise the mathematics curriculum have                       placed a great emphasis on topics from discrete mathematics.                    These courses did not exist, for the most part, when the                        present crop of high school mathematics teachers were in their                  teacher preparation programs and yet many of the topics in the                  courses are now to be included in the courses the teachers are                  expected to teach. It is essentially the education of the                       material as well as the adaptation of the concepts to the                       school program that is the thrust of this project.",
