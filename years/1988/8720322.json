 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Iberian Massif constitutes the southwestern most and largest           fragment of the Amorican Plate, which appears to have been  separated           from North America, Baltica and Gondwana during the early Paleozoic,            but was involved in considerable orogenesis during later Paleozoic              time.  A variety of plate tectonic models and continental                       reconstructions have been proposed, however knowledge of the critical           Amorican plate has prevented resolution of the tectonic history of              these plates.  Recent detailed mapping carried out by the Spanish               Geologic Survey (IGME) provides the basis for this research which               involves systematic determination of 40 Ar/39 Ar mineral and whole-rock         phyllite ages within representative areas of the five major                     lithotectonic elements which comprise southern portions of the Iberian          Massif.  These data on the tectonothermal evolution of this area would          permit a more critical analysis of the contrasting plate tectonic               models and aid in definition of exotic terranes within southern Iberia.",
