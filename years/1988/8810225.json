 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award initiates a five-year continuing grant to support               an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Parallel                 and Distributive Intelligence Systems at the University of                      Pittsburgh.                                                                          In recent years the computer industry (manufacturers,                      programmers, users) has acknowledged the following critical                     research areas of importance:  human-computer interfaces,                       conceptual modeling, programming environments, database design,                 system architecture, and performance and system simulation.                     Conferences, workshops and seminars have emphasized the concept of              \"visualization\" and of a \"visual computer\" as a vital research                  approach to these critical areas.  A Visual Computer is not a                   \"black box,\" but a \"transparent box\" with many windows for the                  user to look into different aspects of the system and for the                   computer to visualize various aspects of the user and therefore                 adaptively improve its performance.  The Center will initially                  concentrate on a Visual Computer approach to research in the                    general area of distributed intelligence systems with specific                  projects in user interface engineering, programming languages and               environments, and novel systems architectures.                                       The Principal Investigator, Dr. S.K. Chang, is chairman of                 the Department of Computer Science and is eminently qualified to                be Director of the Center.  He has recruited Dr. Bruce G.                       Buchanan, formerly of Stanford University and internationally                   recognized for his research on artificial intelligence and expert               systems, to be co-director of the Center.                                            Twelve U.S. companies have provided letters of intent to join              the Center at $25,000/year; furthermore the university will return              all indirect costs to the Center during the first three years and               the indirect cost rate will be only 10% thereafter.  Adequate                   space and research laboratories have been provided plus an                      allocation of at least two new permanent faculty members in                     computer science.                                                                    An NSF continuing grant of $50,000 per year for five years is              recommended.  For year 2-5, $50,000 will be awarded on an annual                basis.  The Program Director will review annually the progress of               the Center on a number of criteria, including:  1)  the extent to               which university/industry interaction and collaboration are                     developing; 2) the extent to which the support base for the center              is expanding; and 3) the extent to which a robust research program              is developing.                                                                       An additional $5,000 is recommended during this first year to              support an undergraduate research assistant, Miss Patricia Rapp,                in work on \"Parallel Algorithms for Visualization,\" a Center                    project.  Dr. S.K. Chang will supervise Miss Rapp's research.",
