 "awd_abstract_narration": "An integrated three-year program including geology, geophysics                  and geochemistry is planned for the purpose of studying the                     active volcano Nevado del Ruiz, Colombia.  Since the November,                  1985 eruption, the PI has been engaged in a diverse set of                      preliminary projects at Ruiz which suggest that previously held                 beliefs about the volcano may be in error.  In order to improve                 our understanding and to contribute to the general conceptual                   model of Andean volcanism a four-task program has been developed:               1) A detailed geological study of the volcanic complex including                analyusis of the age of volcanism, its evolution, eruption                      dynamics, petrology, and volcanic hazards.  2) A study of recent                behavior of the volcano as recorded in the nine known tephra                    layers distributed widely over the region.  Eruption volumes,                   dynamics and evolution will be a primary focus.  3) A detailed                  gravity study to evaluate and model the subsurface structure of                 Ruiz.  Most of the questions about the unusual aspects of the                   form and behavior of Ruiz could be resolved if an unrecognized                  caldera were actually present.  4) A continued analysis of the                  geothgermal system and its response to the mesurgence of magma.                 An effort will be made to more completely sample the system,                    analyze the alteration products, and determine their age and                    relationship to the geological evolution.  Additional isotopic                  studies will be undertaken to understand the nature of the deep                 reservoir and the origins of the main and minor constituents.                   The goal of the research is to produce an integrated model of the               major northern Andean volcanic center which could then be applied               to and compared with those developed at other circumPacific                     volcanoes.",
