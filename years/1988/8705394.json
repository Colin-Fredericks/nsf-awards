 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thisresearch concerns the relationship between oviposition                      preference and larval performance in closely-related butterfly                  species of Papilio (Lepidoptera) that differ in the plant                       families on which they feed.  The study will take advantage of                  the recent finding that oviposition preference in P. oregonius is               controlled partly by loci on the X chromosome.  This finding                    provides for the first time the opportunity to ask some                         fundamental questions on how oviposition preference and larval                  performance are genetically related in the evolution of host                    associations in insect/plant interactions.                                      Section I of the study tests whether larval performance on                      different plant species is controlled, partly or solely, by loci                on the X chromosome as is oviposition preference in these                       species.  Section II then analyzes whether there is variation                   among isofemale lines within population in larval performance on                different plant species as there is for host selection in                       ovipositing females in these species.  Finally, section III                     considers how variation in larval performance correlates with                   variation in oviposition preference with respect to inheritance                 through the X chromosome.                                                       Together, the results from these three sections will aid in                     the development of the theory of insect/plant interactions and                  the evolutionary ecology of host association by addressing the                  fundamental problem of the relationship between oviposition                     preference and larval performance on different hosts.",
