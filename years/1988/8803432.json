 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current trends in high performance computer design indicate that                parallel processing is the only way to deliver the speed needed to              tackle the computational problems confronted by modern science and              engineering.  It is not reasonable to expect that programmers can               successfully program the variety of parallel architectures being                proposed without the assistance of automated and interactive                    parallelization tools.  This project will design software tools that            help the programmer develop new programs, perhaps by restructuring              existing programs, that run efficiently on one or more parallel                 architectures.                                                                                                                                                  The work concerns the design and prototyping of three related tools or          sets of tools:  (1) a tool for parallel program performance estimation,         (2) a set of tools for automatically or interactively parallelizing             Lisp programs, and (3) a portable run-time environment for parallelized         programs.                                                                                                                                                       The direct impact of this research will be that the time required to            develop new programs for parallel architectures will decrease and the           efficiency of programs running on parallel architectures will increase.         Furthermore, because less time will be required to develop new programs         it will be possible to test out new architectural ideas and new                 parallel processors more quickly and with less programmer effort.  This         may in turn lead to more rapid improvements in parallel architectures.",
