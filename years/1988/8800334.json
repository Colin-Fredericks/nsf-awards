 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of eight U.S. scientists              in a seminar on the \"Remote Sensing of Biosphere Functioning,\"                  organized jointly by Dr. Harold A. Mooney of Stanford University                and Dr. Richard J. Hobbs of the Australian CSIRO Division of                    Wildlife and Rangelands Research.  United States and Australian                 participants will meet at the East-West Center in Honolulu, Hawaii              during July 1988.  The seminar will address how remote sensing                  technology can be used to make coordinated measurements on a global             scale of various physical, chemical and biological parameters.                  Discussions will focus on the capabilities of remote sensing                    hardware, the assessment of physical, chemical, and biological                  parameters based on remotely sensed reflectance data, the ability               to quantify processes such as photosynthesis, decomposition and                 species succession, data handling requirements, and the types of                experiments needed to relate ground based and remotely sensed                   measurements.                                                                                                                                                   The United States and Australia are both leaders in the development             and utilization of remote sensing technology.  Australian                       scientists, faced with understanding and managing vast landscape                units, have pioneered in the development of remote sensing                      technology to meet this challenge.  The United States, through its              large space program, has fostered extensive new technology for                  remote sensing of features of the earth's surface.  This seminar                will take advantage of this expertise in identifying the                        requirements for a remote and continuous monitoring of the                      functioning of the earth's biosphere.",
