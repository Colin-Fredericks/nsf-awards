 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hydrothermal venting along axes of seafloor spreading in the            eastern Pacific gives rise to bouyant plumes of warm water which                rise and mix with ocean bottom waters.  These plumes are an                     important measure of hydrothermal output and dispersal of both                  heat and chemicals, and an exploration guide for new vent fields,               yet little is known about their physical structure or the                       chemical processes which occur within them.  Drs. Mottl and Von                 Herzen have developed a method for measuring and characterizing                 the hydrothermal flux of heat and chemicals on the scale of an                  individual vent field, using a 50 m high moored instrument array                suspended above the submersible ALVIN via flotation.  With this                 device, which was tested successfully on the East Pacific Rise in               1984, they can measure the three-dimensional temperature field of               a plume and collect two-dimensional profiles of flow velocity,                  conductivity, pressure, and particle concentration via light                    transmittance, plus samples of water containing suspended                       particles of black sulfide \"smoke\" from various heights above the               vents.  They propose to apply this technique to a series of                     contiguous vent fields along a 10 km segment of the Juan de Fuca                Ridge, as part of an integrated program of physical, chemical,                  and geologic observations their objectives are to characterize                  the physical and chemical structure of the vent field plumes, to                compare these with plume theory, to estimate the chemical and                   heat fluxes from the vent fields and along the total segment due                to both localized hot spring and diffuse warm spring venting, to                identify chemical processes occurring within the plumes, and to                 determine the importance of these processes for the fate of the                 hydrothermal input.  They will also compile a geologic map and                  description of the vent field and associated massive sulfide                    deposits.",
