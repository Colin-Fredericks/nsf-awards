 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will establish an REU Site at North Dakota State                     University for eight students in the area of Plant Molecular                    Biology during the summer of 1988.  Student Participants will be                selected mainly from the community colleges and 4-year liberal                  arts colleges in ND, SD, MN, IA and WI, with a particular                       emphasis on recruiting minorities from institutions that have a                 high Native American and/or women enrollment.  The research                     activities will be led by four faculty members active in plant                  and molecular biology research and will focus on DNA structure,                 DNA replication and protein synthesis in selected plants and                    plant organelles.  Besides doing fundamental research, each REU                 Participant will also gain insights into experimental design,                   development of organizational skills and communication of                       research results.  The REU Participants will work in pairs, each                pair under the direction of one of the four REU Faculty Advisors.               The Participants will participate in special weekly Colloquia to                discuss research progress and plans, have weekly presentations by               other scientists on the Campus on topics related to cellular and                molecular biology (ex. plant, animal and insect tissue culture,                 plant micropropagation, electron microscopy, monoclonal antibody                and immunology) and have discussions with three to four visiting                scientists.  Tours of biotechnology laboratory facilities in                    Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN are planned.",
