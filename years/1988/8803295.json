 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most visible symptoms of eutrophication is high                 phytoplankton standing crop.  Recently, investigators have                      hypothesized that by increasing piscivorous fish densities in                   lakes, planktivorous fish abundance should be made to decline,                  leading to higher zooplankton biomass or altered species                        composition and thus indirectly to lower phytoplankton standing                 crop.  Piscivorous fish are limited in the maximum size of prey                 they can ingest by the dimensions of their mouths.  Because                     several studies have shown that this \"gape limitation\" can be                   very important in influencing interactions between piscivores and               their prey, there should be differential effects of piscivores on               populations of prey that differ in body shape.                                       This differential predation may in turn influence the degree               of piscivore-mediated cascading trophic effects on zooplankton                  and phytoplankton.  Laboratory experiments will examine prey                    election by piscivorous largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides)                 for two species of planktivores representing extremes in general                body type: fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas), soft-rayed and                shallow-bodied and bluegills (Lepomis macrochirus), hard-spined                 and deep bodied.  A long-term pond experiment using 20                          experimental ponds will also examine largemouth bass-fathead                    minnow and largemouth bass-bluegill interactions and their                      cascading effects on zooplankton and phytoplankton.  The outcome                of these experiments will test ecological theory and has                        immediate applied value in lake management.",
