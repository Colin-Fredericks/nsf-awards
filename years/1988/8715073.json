 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this RUI research project is to perform in-            depth analytical and experimental investigations toward the design,             fabrication and evaluation of an antenna system characterized by                excellent electrical performance to meet all requirements for                   satellite communications and other space applications.  Another                 important objective is to provide undergraduate students with                   significant experience in the analysis techniques of antenna radiation          and wave propagation.  Students will also acquire a background in               fabrication and evaluation of antenna systems for specified purposes.           These critical skills can be applied in graduate-level work, future             research, engineering development and manufacturing.  The proposed              antenna is a dielectric-loaded double-flare conical horn.  Design of            the horn will combine 1) techniques for multimode operation for                 improved antenna patterns with low cross-polarization and reduced               sidelobes and 2) the technique of dielectric loading for gain and               directivity enhancement.  The antenna will have attractive features in          simplicity of design, ease of construction and greater gain to replace          the corrugated conical horn currently in use for satellite                      communication.  The antenna's performance will be demonstrated                  theoretically through rigorous analytical treatment, and will be                established experimentally by observation of unique features of high            gain, greater directivity, reduced sidelobes, low cross-polarization            and wide bandwidth.  A variable beamwidth facility required for                 special applications in satellite communication will also be                    investigated.",
