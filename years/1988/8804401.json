 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently the Geochemistry Division at Lamont-Doherty purchased a                new Isomass 110 mass spectrometer.  This machine, designed to                   their specifications, is the first of a new generation of                       solid-source mass spectrometers to be built by V.G. Isotopes.  It               will incorporate a number of features which will make possible                  techniques not possible by conventional thermal ionization mass                 spectrometry and thereby open the door to several exciting new                  research areas.  One of the most important justifications for                   this machine is its potential for analysis of 187Os/186Os ratios                in very small samples.  Consequently it is the plan of the PI and               his team to: 1) learn and develop the scientific potential of this              machine working on a variety of different samples, and 2)                       establish the chemical techniques nessery to exploit the Re/Os                  isotope system as a tool for identifying and tracing the Earth's                dynamic components.  The majority of grant funds will go for the                support of personnel who will be responsible for the development                and implementation of these new techniques.  Several scientific                 problems will eventually be studied, but the primary purpose of                 this award is to develop and establish the efficacy of the new                  mass spectrometer and the Re/Os system.",
