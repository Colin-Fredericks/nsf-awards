 "awd_abstract_narration": "The early Tertiary Period was a critical time in the                    evolutionary radiation of mammals, and the American West has an                 extraordinarily rich fossil record of this time interval.                       Principal Investigators Krishtalka and Stucky propose to continue               their highly successful excavations and study of fossil                         vertebrates of this age from the Wind River Basin in Wyoming.                   In addition to excavating and studying these important fossils,                 they have received research support from NASA for the geological                aspects of their work, and for computer equipment, software and                 training for remote sensing research.  Images from satellite- and               aircraft-borne sensors have provided them with an unprecedented                 view of the region's stratigraphy.  This new technology has                     allowed finer distinctions between rock-types, which can then be                related to faunal differences between ancient habitat types.                            The Wind River Basin project has already produced complete              cranial and post-cranial remains of previously poorly-known                     groups, and the proposed project has the potential to increase                  greatly our understanding of early mammalian history.  This first               attempt to use remote sensing technology in systematic                          paleontology will break new methodological ground, and will open                new areas for biological research.",
