 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Prof. Jose               Salas, Colorado State University, and Prof. Renzo Rosso of the                  Politecnico di Milano in Milan, Italy.  The researchers intend to               collaborate in the area of flood hazards and precipitation                      prediction.  As a main objective they plan to develop, document and             exchange information concerning prediction of extreme floods and                short term precipitation events.  The investigators' plan calls for             the use of multivariate distribution functions, maximum likelihood              techniques for regional flood estimation, and the theory of point and           cluster processes for prediction of precipitation.                                                                                                              Each side has ongoing research aimed at 1) prediction of extreme                floods based on available data at more than one site, 2) regional               flood frequency analysis based on parsimonious mixture models and               improved estimation techniques, and 3) analysis and prediction of               short term precipitation processes.  The Italian side has expertise             in the area of flood prediction based on mixture models, estimation             concerning regional flood frequency and the corresponding software,             and in the determination of external properties for some alternative            models applicable to short term rainfall.  The U.S. side brings to              the collaboration expertise using bivariate general extreme value               distributions and the experience in estimation and application of               short term rainfall models for a large data base.  Consequently, this           collaboration and the attendant exchange of information and                     techniques should prove to be mutually beneficial.",
