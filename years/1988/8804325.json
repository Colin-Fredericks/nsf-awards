 "awd_abstract_narration": "The undergraduate research program of the Department of                         Pharmacology, University of South Alabama, will provide research                experiences for nine undergraduates.  The focus of the program is               cellular signalling, e.g., how hormones, calcium, cyclic                        nucleotides, protein phosphorylation, and induction of specific                 intracellular proteins may influence cell function.  The eight                  participating faculty have extramural research support and                      ongoing, active research programs.  Students will be provided a                 research experience in a laboratory selected by them on the basis               of summary descriptions and discussion with the investigator.  In               addition, students will receive a formal review of the general                  area of cell signalling via an organized weekly course.  Students               will be recruited from regional undergraduate institutions that                 do not themselves provide formal research experiences for                       undergraduates.  Recruiting will be accomplished through science                counselors, mail brochures and campus visits.  Students will be                 provided compensation and access to student facilities (e.g.,                   housing and meal services).",
