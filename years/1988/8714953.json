 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in nuclear                             physics between Jurg X. Saladin of the University of                            Pittsburgh and Prof. O. Dietzsch of the University of                           Sao Paulo, Brazil. These scientists have had a                                  long-standing collaboration over two decades. Several                           students have been trained under this research                                  including one who has joined the Pittsburgh group. A                            systematic study is being carried out of high nuclear                           spin states on the recently completed multidetector                             array and 14-element spectrometer at Pittsburgh. The                            data on experiments with (76,77,78)Kr will be analyzed                          by a graduate student on her return to Sao Paulo so                             not only are the personnel of both groups essential                             for the array experiments but both groups benefit from                          the collaboration.                                                                                                                                              Experiments are now to be carried out on (72-75)Kr,                             study of nuclear structure in the region 70<A<80 and                            high spin states in the A=170 neutron-rich region.                              Some of this work will be done at the National                                  Superconducting Cyclotron at Michigan State. The                                Brazilians will participate in this. Later the U.S.                             scientists will help perform the data analysis in                               Brazil continuing a productive collaboration with                               mutual benefits for both countries.",
