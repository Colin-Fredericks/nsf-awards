 "awd_abstract_narration": "This renewal project is concerned with two areas of importance for              increasing the impact of biological processes on production of                  specialty chemicals:  use of non-aqueous solvents for enzyme catalyzed          reactions and development of novel separations processes based on               aqueous two-phase systems.  The first aspect will focus on enzyme               reactions in supercritical solvents:  In the previous grant period,             the stability of enzymes, both free and immobilized in dense carbon             dioxide, has been demonstrated, and kinetic data have been obtained             for the oxidation of cholesterol and the interesterification of                 triacylglycerides.  This research expands the possible range of                 substrate concentrations which can be used with supercritical carbon            dioxide by exploring its use with entrainers; it also provides a more           detailed study of the kinetic and mass transfer effects of importance           for both enzymes studied.  In addition, the conformation of enzymes in          this non-aqueous medium is examined by the use of EPR spectroscopy.  A          nitroxide spin-labelled cholesterol probe is employed to monitor the            spatial coordinates at the active site of cholesterol oxidase.                                                                                                  The second aspect will focus on aqueous two-phase systems for product           recovery:  This research is directed toward establishing the                    fundamental molecular thermodynamics of aqueous two-phase systems.  An          important objective is to determine what polymer-polymer systems may            be best suited for bioprocessing.  Toward that end, the PIs continue            their measurements using light scattering and differential vapor                pressure to obtain thermodynamic parameters for aqueous mixtures                containing dextran, polyethyleneglycol, proteins and combinations of            polymer-polymer and polymer protein pairs.  These data, combined with           information on electrical-potential effects due to salt partitioning            and a molecular-thermodynamic model based upon the osmotic virial               equation, allow the PI's to predict polymer-polymer-water phase                 diagrams and protein partition coefficients for process design and              optimization.",
