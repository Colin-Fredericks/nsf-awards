 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will use Ohio's Thomas Edison science & technology centers         as natural magnets to improve science & technology education in grades          7-12.  It will (1) stimulate development of student research projects in        biotechnology, polymers, and manufacturing sciences; (2) provide                opportunities for in-service education of science and mathematics               teachers in areas of leading edge technologies; (3) promote                     participation of teachers and students in educational opportunities             provided by science and technology research centers; (4) engage                 scientists and engineers working in areas of leading edge technologies          as role models and subject matter specialists in science and mathematics        classrooms; and (5) engage teachers in summer internships in areas of           leading edge technologies.                                                                                                                                      Matched in part by university and industrial support, Ohio's Thomas             Edison Partnership Program has committed millions of state dollars to           the development of nine centers in Ohio.  These centers are focused on          research in biotechnology, polymers, welding engineering, manufacturing         sciences, materials science, and information technologies.  This program        will enable students and educators in grades 7-12 to take advantage of          existing and developing technology research centers and to consult and          share knowledge more closely with practicing engineers and scientists in        the private sector.  Five specific activities are planned:  (1) to              publish three science project workbooks, (2) to conduct six in-service          workshops; (3) to publish five calendars of events; (4) to develop a            visiting scholars program affecting 140,000 students; and (5) to                establish fourteen teacher internships.                                                                                                                         The partnership consists of five kinds of members: (1) more than 100            local schools in Ohio; (2) public and private school board associations;        (3) trade and professional association such as the Ohio Chemical                Council; (4) Edison Technology Centers; and (5) corporations and                institutions such as Battelle Memorial Institute, Monsanto Company, Ohio        Edison, Liebert Company, The College of Wooster, and the University of          Cincinnati.",
