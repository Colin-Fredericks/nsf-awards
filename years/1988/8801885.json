 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broad objective of this proposal is to elucidate the                   mechanisms that control the activation of protein synthesis at                  fertilization in sea urchin eggs.  The increase in protein                      synthesis is mediated by both the activation of stored maternal                 messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNPs) and an increase in the                      activity of the translational machinery.  Dr. Grainger proposes                 to do a detailed study of the factors that control the repression               and activation of stored maternal mRNPs.  Proteins that are                     involved in the translational repression of egg mRNPs will be                   identified by comparing the protein pattern of inactive egg                     poly(A)+mRNPs and active fertilized poly(A)+mRNPs.  In addition,                potential candidates for masking factors will be isolated from in               vitro activated mRNPs.  Antibodies against these mRNP masking                   proteins will be used to monitor changes in mRNP proteins as egg                mRNPs become activated at fertilization.  Changes in                            intracellular calcium and pH trigger ugg activation and the                     increase in the rate of protein synthesis.  Dr. Grainger will                   alter the calcium and pH levels of unfertilized eggs and measure                the effect of these changes on the translational activity of egg                mRNPs.  Using antibodies against the mRNP masking factors, he                   will determine which proteins are modified or released by these                 treatments.                                                                     %%%                                                                                 The unfertilized egg is a metabolically quiescent, non-                     dividing cell. Fertilization results in the activation of a                     series of pathways, including those leading to an increase in the               rate of protein synthesis.  Dr. Grainger proposes to study the                  biochemical processes involved in this activation of protein                    synthesis upon fertilization using the sea urchin as a model                    system.",
