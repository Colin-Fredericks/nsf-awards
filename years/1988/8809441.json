 "awd_abstract_narration": "Great progress is being made on understanding exactly how sex                   steroids act on the nervous system to yield adaptive behavior                   and physiology that serves to promote reproductive success.                     Dr. Adkins-Regan is performing experiments on birds which                       investigates the spinal level neuroendocrine processes.  This                   work will contribute to our understanding of the role of                        testosterone metabolites in androgenic actions on the nervous                   system.  Dr. Adkins-Regan has data that show that these sex                     steroids change the dendritic arborizations of motor neurons.                   This finding has ramifications for neuronal plasticity in the                   adult.  This work is important because there is increasing                      recognition that in addition to specific reproduction related                   effects on the nervous system such as the production of sexual                  dimorphism, sex hormones may have more general trophic effects                  on neural development.  Neuroendocrinology is a tremendously                    fast moving field, and its study should yield many new findings                 regarding the physiology of human behavior.",
