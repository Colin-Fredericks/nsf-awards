 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfields of laser spectroscopy and                        electrochemistry.  This research continues the Principal                        Investigator's application of nonlinear optical methods and                     particularly optical second harmonic generation (SHG) to study                  electrode surface properties.  The studies will comprise two                    categories.  The first involves a detailed analysis of factors                  contributing to the observed optical anisotropy of a crystalline                electrode surface.  The second focuses on examining the                         sensitivity of SHG to surface stability and reconstruction                      phenomena induced by the properties of the electrochemical double               layer.  Both in situ and vacuum studies will be carried out, with               the primary emphasis on metallic electrodes.                                                                                                                    Characterizing the chemical and physical interactions present at                the junction between a solid and a liquid at a microscopic level                is of importance to many technologically relevant areas such as                 the fabrication of new materials and devices, corrosion, adhesion,              catalysis and thin film growth.  This task is challenging owing to              the difficulty of distinguishing the structure and electronic                   properties of the atomically thin interfacial region from those                 of the adjacent bulk media and the lack of suitable in situ                     spectroscopic techniques for investigating condensed phase                      interfaces.  A promising new approach to this problem is the                    application of SHG spectroscopy since this technique is                         inherently sensitive to the surface electronic properties of                    crystalline media.  In addition, the SHG signal is dependent on                 the orientation of the crystal and the polarization of the                      incident laser beam.  The anisotropic response can provide                      information about the order and symmetry of the surface.",
