 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Barbara Hale will apply computer models of                    water/ice systems and a scaled nucleation rate formalism to the                 study of heterogeneous ice nucleation.  The goals are to                        characterize ice nucleating features of natural atmospheric and                 artificial ice nuclei in terms of microscopic substrate                         properties and develop analytic the which provide microscopic                   substrate properties and develop analytic the which provide                     convenient estimates of threshold temperatures and heterogeneous                nucleation rates.  Specifically, threshold temperatures for ice                 formation in adsorbed water layers on model substrates (such as a               model silver iodide basal face and a model hydroxylated silica                  surface) and on substrates with modified water.substrate                        interactions will be examined for effects of: (1) substrate                     lattice structure, (2) water.substrate binding energy, (3)                      substrate ledge defects, (4) external electric field and pressure               pulse perturbations, and (5) thickness of the condensed water                   layers. The computer simulations use effective water.water and                  water.substrate atomic pair potentials and Monte Carlo techniques               to generate canonical ensemble averages of thermodynamic                        quantities for the adsorbed water/ice systems.                                          This work is important because it provides quantitative                 descriptions of the heterogeneous phase change mechanism, in                    particular, the ice phase formation.",
