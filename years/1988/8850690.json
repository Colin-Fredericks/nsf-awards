 "awd_abstract_narration": "This model project includes, in the first year of operation, several            activities to strengthen minority education at the precollege level             and to improve the transition of Native Alaskan students into college           and university.  It was developed under the leadership of the                   University of Alaska with the cooperation of the school systems in              Alaska, Native organizations and corporations, industry, and State              Agencies.  During the first year, a set of activities based on science          and mathematics experiences, and designed to nurture, encourage and             motivate minority students, are being implemented.  These consist of a          one-year sequence of four phases to prepare students in precollege              mathematics, science, and study skills by providing instruction in              mathematics and science as well as incorporating internships and                science research projects specifically related to Native and rural              activities in Alaska.  The four phases are: five-weeks of intensive             academic instruction at the University of Alaska, including an                  introduction to biology, chemistry, basic mathematics, and a seminar on         culture, ideas, and the values of science; distance delivery                    instruction in which academic coursework will be continued by delivery          to students' home sites; a return to the campus for further laboratory          experience; and, a career counseling support activity to encourage              enrollment in college-level science courses.  Plans for the second year         will include science and mathematics activities at the undergraduate            level.",
