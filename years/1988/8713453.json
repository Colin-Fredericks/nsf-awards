 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Professor Thomas         M. Nordlund of the University of Rochester School of Medicine and               Dr. Rudolf Rigler of the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm in the field           of molecular dynamics.  In particular, the influence of molecular               motions on the binding and dissolution of DNA by the Eco R1 protein             will be studied, both through direct experimentation and using computer         simulation.  The experiments will use an extremely fast photomultiplier         to count the photons emitted by the fluorescence of a molecule adjacent         to that whose motions are being studied; this fluorescence occurs               during binding or disintegration.  Molecular excitation will be                 performed by both laser and synchrotron radiation; the latter has the           advantage of continuous tunability and facilities for measuring the             time dependence of the fluorescence emission.  The computer simulations         will involve calculating correlations among energy functions for the            various protein-DNA reactions which arise in the binding and                    dissolution process.                                                                                                                                            The availability of both laser and synchrotron experimental apparatus           and expert staff for the computer simulations makes the Karolinska              Institute an ideal location for this collaborative research.  This work         will provide the U.S. investigator with an opportunity to use equipment         and techniques to which he does not ordinarily have access, and to              learn specialized techniques for subsequent application at his own              institution.  In addition, the project will increase our understanding          of how DNA is modified by interactions with various proteins, which may         lead to numerous practical applications.",
