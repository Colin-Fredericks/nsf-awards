 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable the winner of the Second National Student                Projects Competition in Science, Technology and Society to travel               to the international meeting of the Society for Social Studies of               Science (4S) in order to receive the award and present the                      research project for which it was given.  The meeting will be                   held November 16-19, 1988, in Amsterdam.  The first competition                 was held in association with the 4S meeting in Worcester,                       Massachusetts in 1987. From 47 student entries, a top prize and                 three second prizes were awarded.  The event was successful and                 the project sponsors, Worcester Polytechnic Institute and the 4S,               decided to continue this effort to introduce promising young                    talent to the review process and provide a forum for development                of both written and oral communication of research findings.  The               ultimate goal is to institutionalize an international, biennial                 competition for the best undergraduate paper in science,                        technology and society studies.                                                                                                                                 The scope and organization of this activity are meritorious; it                 has the potential to evolve into an important element in                        undergraduate STS education.  The principal investigator was                    responsible for the successful first year's effort, and he has                  made appropriate contacts for the second year to be successful as               well.  The project is a very cost-effective mechanism by which to               encourage the development of this research field.  Therefore,                   support in the amount of $539 is awarded.",
