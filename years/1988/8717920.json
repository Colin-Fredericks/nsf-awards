 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Patrick S. Mariano,                  Department of Chemistry, University of Maryland, to pursue with                 Dr. Ung Chan Yoon, Department of Chemistry, Pusan National                      University, for a period of 24 months, a program of cooperative                 research on electron transfer-induced photochemical reactions of                organic systems.  Specifically, sequential electron                             transfer-electrofugal group elimination sequences, promoted by                  excitation of reacting substrates or electron transfer                          photosensitizers, will be employed as general methods for generation            of heteroatom substituted carbon radicals.                                                                                                                      This project is a continuation of the cooperative research of the               two investigators supported under NSF Grant No. INT8416512, which               adds an international cooperative dimension to Dr. Mariano's                    research under NSF Grants No. CHE8308242 and CHE8609589, as                     amended.  Their previous collaborative research has been highly                 successful and has resulted in several joint publications in                    refereed journals.  This successful collaboration has generated                 ideas which serve as the basis for continuing joint research.  The              studies planned for the period of continued collaboration should                provide knowledge about various aspects of the new area of electron             transfer photochemistry (photoelectrochemistry) and about new and               potentially efficient methods for construction of complex molecular             structures.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the                  U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the              level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and                     engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas,                skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of                 mutual benefit.",
