 "awd_abstract_narration": "The quality of undergraduate instruction in organic chemistry and               general chemistry is being improved through the acquisition and                 upgrading of equipment.  Major instruments being added are a gas                chromatograph (GC) system, a high-pressure liquid chromatograph (HPLC)          system, and Apple IIgs computer system and an interactive microware             (IMI) data acquisition system.  The instruments are enhancing the               implementation of the microscale laboratory program and are                     complementing each other in analytical capabilities, increasing student         access to modern equipment, familiarizing them with computer                    acquisition, storage and manipulation of data, and introducing them to          HPLC.  Chemical instrumentation is being treated as a an integral part          of the laboratory work, thereby strengthening the quality of the                learning.  Laboratory activities such as kinetic studies, competitive           reactions, ad determination of product distribution ratios is allowing          students to actually collect data instead of only seeing it in a text           book.  The project is significantly impacting the quality of science            education for a group of students in a community college that serves            not only as a lower division program, but also to educate employees in          a 10-mile circle of science based corporate neighbors.
