In the United                  States, data about schools' instructional uses of computers,                    particularly in mathematics, science, computer studies, and the                 English language, will be obtained by survey methods from                       principals and teachers in 1,800 schools.  This data, combined                  with similar data collected in 1983 and 1985, will be used to                   document changes in teachers' and principals' actions and beliefs               about the applicability of computers to instruction in                          mathematics , science, computer studies, and other fields.                      Because all 18 participating countries will be employing nearly                 identical survey instruments and similar sampling practices,                    international comparisons will also be made with this data.                                                                                                     This project also includes a policy analysis of the effects of                  state policies and approaches towards school technology on actual               school practice, by combining detailed inquiry into state-level                 actions with school-level survey data, the survey sample having                 been substantially supplemented in six states selected to provide               a wide cross-section of demographic environments and approaches                 to technology by state governments.",
