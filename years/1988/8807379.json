Curtiss and Lange will collaborate to develop visible and                  near infrared (VNIR) reflectance spectroscopy as a non-                         destructive technique for the determination of the mineralogical                composition of jade and related stone artifacts.  The technique                 will be refined by the detailed study of the reflectance spectra                of a well characterized set of archaeological and geological                    samples.  The mineral and chemical compositions of these samples                will be defined using the techniques of X-ray diffraction, X-ray                fluorescence, electron microprobe analysis, scanning electron                   microscopy, and petrographic thin section analysis.  Working with               samples of known provenience, the investigators will determine                  the extent to which sample homogeneity exists within a single                   source area and the extent to which different source areas vary                 from each other.  If successful, the technique can provide a non-               destructive way to match jade archaeological objects to source                  areas.                                                                                                                                                          Through much of Middle America and the American Southwest, jade                 functioned as a prestige item and is often recovered in                         archaeological contexts.  It is likely that this valued item was                traded over long distances, and therefore, if an accurate non-                  destructive sourcing method were developed, archaeologists could                reconstruct trade routes.  A number of important questions could                then be answered.  It has been argued, for example, that the                    complex societies which emerged in the Southwest U.S.A. are the                 result of contact with even more highly developed Mexican groups.               One argument used to support this contention is the presence of                 jade objects.  However, the sources of this jade is unknown and                 until it is proven (or disproved) that the source lies to the                   South, the issue is still in doubt.  Secondly, many                             archaeologists believe that the emergence of large scale                        societies is directly related to the development and control of                 trade networks.  Thus, techniques which can match objects in                    archeological sites to raw material sources can help to answer                  this question.                                                                                                                                                  This research is important because it may provide a valuable new                tool for archaeologists.  Since it is non-destructive, it can be                applied to museum specimens and significantly increase the                      knowledge which may be gained from them.",
