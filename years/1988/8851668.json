 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new laboratory course in polymer chemistry is being introduced with           the acquisition of a thermal analysis system for differential scanning          calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).  The equipment          is also being used in five undergraduate courses covering analytical,           inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry.  The equipment is being             utilized to expand the offerings in undergraduate research.  Sophomore,         junior, and senior students are studying the properties, structure, and         reactions of a variety of compounds using thermal analysis as a probe.          The thermal analysis instrumentation provides a dual benefit in                 improving the course offerings and updating the instrument holdings to          enable the characterization of polymers.  Instruction in polymer                chemistry in the undergraduate curriculum has been neglected in many            institutions. With the thermal analysis system with DSC and TGA                 capabilities new experiments can be introduced throughout the                   curriculum meeting the recommendations of the Committee on Professional         Training of the American Chemical Society in this important area.               The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.",
