 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Arnold and colleagues will conduct archaeological research on               Santa Cruz, the second largest of the Channel Islands, located                  off the California coast.  In early historic times these islands                were occupied by Chumash Indians who by the time of contact had                 developed a stratified chiefly society.  Archaeological data                    indicates original colonization of the island took place over                   5,000 years ago and suggests that a relatively abrupt change in                 social organization occurred about 900 years ago when a                         relatively egalitarian system was replaced by a more stratified                 one.  The goal of Dr. Arnold's research is to understand this                   transformation.                                                                                                                                                 Because deep sea cores have been drilled in the Channel Island                  region, paleoenvironmental data is excellent.  These suggest a                  warming of the ocean and the destruction of rich kelp beds at                   approximately the time when this social reorganization occurred.                The probable result was a decrease in available food for Channel                Island inhabitants, and Dr. Arnold postulates that this provided                the calatyst for change.  To test this, she will conduct survey                 and excavate a series of sites on Santa Cruz.  Analysis of faunal               remains will allow her to determine if a change in diet actually                occurred, while examination of human skeletal remains will permit               changing nutritional status to be assessed.  Dr. Arnold                         postulates that social stratification and craft specialization                  both accompanied this change, and analysis of changing site sizes               and differential distribution of prestige items should provide                  relevant data.                                                                                                                                                  This research is important because it will shed light on the                    prehistory of Native American cultures.  It will also increase                  our understanding of how complex societies develop and how they                 respond to environmental stress.",
