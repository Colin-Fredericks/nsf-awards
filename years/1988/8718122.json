 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most                       powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                   the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                     substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                  molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                    molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                          spectroscopy is essential to chemists who are carrying out                      frontier research.                                                                                                                                              This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program                    will help the Chemistry Department at the Univeristy of                         Pittsburgh to acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer.  The areas                 of chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition                   include:                                                                                                                                                        1) Study of the mechanism of action of vitamin B-12 through                        synthetic models                                                                                                                                             2) Development of new synthetic methods using sulfur reagents                                                                                                   3) The determination of the stereochemistry of alkylidene-alkyl                    insertion reactions                                                                                                                                          4) Natural product synthesis and the development of new                            synthetic methods                                                                                                                                            5) Construction of complex natural product systems                                                                                                              6) Free radical clocks as probes of enzyme mechanism                                                                                                            7) Studies in molecular recognition",
