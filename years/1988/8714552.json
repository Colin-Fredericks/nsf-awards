 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Professor Karl           Freed of the University of Chicago and Professor Angelo Perico of the           Center for Chemical Physics Research on Natural and Synthetic                   Macromolecules in Genova, Italy.  This research concerns the study of           viscoelastic properties of solutions of flexible polymers.  Using               renormalization group methods and statistical mechanics, the                    investigators plan to extend the theory of concentration dependence             of hydrodynamic properties to incorporate various aspects of the                dynamics of polymers in concentrated solutions.                                                                                                                 This research is an international component of currently supported              work of Professors Freed and Perico.  The aim is to develop a                   complete theory of polymer properties that are dependent on                     hydrodynamic and polymer solvent interactions.  The collaborators               have succeeded in reformulating a hydrodynamic multiple scattering              theory that has the potential for solving many new dynamical problems           related to polymer concentration.  Because of the inherent                      mathematical difficulties associated with these problems even in the            simplest limiting cases, the achievement of a coherent theory should            be a significant advance.  Additionally, the proposed problems are              important and may have a significant impact on applications ranging             from biology to technology.",
