 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lasers provide the chemist with the means of carrying out high                  resolution, high sensitivity experiments related to, for                        example, solution chemistry, spectroscopy, molecular dynamics,                  and biophysical chemistry.  If laser instrumentation is                         configured as a central facility, the research of a group of                    first-rate investigators can be enhanced.                                                                                                                       The Department of Chemistry at Cornell University will use this                 award co-recommended by the Chemical Instrumentation Program,                   the Biological Instrumentation Program, and the Atmospheric                     Chemistry Program to aid in the acquisition of a series of                      lasers.  The lasers will provide a high-resolution continuous                   wave (cw) system, a nanosecond facility, and a picosecond                       facility.  The general areas of chemical and biophysical                        research that will be enhanced by the acquisition and shared                    use of the instrumentation include:                                                                                                                             1) Study of reactions in solutions and the detailed                                 interactions of a solute with a solvent                                     2) Study of the relationships between Raman scattering,                             resonance fluorescence, and normal absorption spectra.                      3) Study of molecular dynamics in gas-phase interactions                        4) Biophysical studies using time-correlated single photon                          counting",
