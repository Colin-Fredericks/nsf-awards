 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's work to date strongly suggest that one can see                 conductivity structure in the upper 1000km of the Earth with                    unprecedented resolution.  The data already analyzed requires                   two sharp jumps near the 400 and 650km seismic discontinuities.                 If this result is true, it should provide a powerful constraint                 on the compositon and physical state of the mantle.  The PI has                 used robust processing which removes a variety of noises,                       including the effects of distortion of the electric field by                    near surface lateral heterogeneities.  This processing produces                 magnetotelluric (MT) impedances which are much more accurate                    than previously obtained.  This data has been inverted using an                 algorithm that produces the globally flattest model fitting the                 data within its errors.  The fact that this least structure                     model requires localized jumps argues strongly for their reality.               The PI will very carefully examine each step of this processing                 to improve both the efficiency and robustness of the compu-                     tations.  This effort will include examining other readily                      available data.",
