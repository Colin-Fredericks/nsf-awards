 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of the proposed project are to study and improve                 analytical methods currently used in the design and modelling of                switching power converters.  In particular, exact solutions for the             behavior of simple converters will be compared with approximate                 solutions obtained with the widely used \"state space average\" method            \u01311!, and to solutions obtained by extension of discrete methods \u01312!.            A number of theorems apply to certain approximate solutions of                  nonlinear systems \u01313,4!.  These will be used to determine the                   conditions under which the state-space average methods are predictive.          At present, the properties of state-space average solutions with                respect to the stability and the transient response of the actual               converter are not well understood.  The relationship between converter          operating frequency and system response time is also not well                   understood \u01315!.  It is expected that existing knowledge of approximate          solution methods will provide a basis for expanding state-space                 averaging so that it can apply to large-signal behavior.  Analytical            results will be verified experimentally for simple dc-dc power                  converters.",
