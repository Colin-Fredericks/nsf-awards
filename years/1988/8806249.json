 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides resources to procure equipment to support                 electromechanical devices research and contact physics research.                The equipment comprises a vibration isolation table, power amplifiers           and a signal processing computer.  Two research projects will benefit           from the availability of the equipment.                                         The first is concerned with the development of a vibration control              method for structures which support ultra precise systems (laser                mounts, precise machining systems, navigational gyroscopes, etc).               The vibration isolation table provides a quiescent environment for              ultra precise experiments associated with this project.  The method             takes advantage of the magnetostrictive properties of materials made            of iron and rare earth metals.  The second project focuses on                   understanding the tribological phenomenon of thermoelastic                      instability, whereby sliding contact between a motor brush and rotor            occurs over microscopic surface bumps (thermal mounds) on the brush             face.  The mound tends to move over the brush face in an unknown                pattern.  The research is directed at predicting this thermal mound             motion.  The equipment will also be used for general tribology                  research which emphasizes electrical contacts.",
