 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of Alaska has                requested several items of oceanographic instrumentation to be                  placed in a pool of shared use equipment.  This equipment is                    maintained for use on or in association with the R/V ALPHA HELIX,               a research vessel owned by the NSF and operated by the University.              A substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1988 is              in support of NSF-sponsored research projects.  The instrumen-                  tation will also increase the capabilities of the ship and of the               institution to support research and engineering activities.  The                equipment includes:                                                                                                                                             -A Disk drive system for increasing shared-use computing                         capabilities,                                                                  -A rapid-flow chemical analyzer for precisely measuring various                  chemical parameters in seawater, and                                           -several precision reversing thermometers.                                                                                                                      The instrumentation described above will increase the capability                of the organization to support NSF-sponsored research and                       engineering projects.",
