 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action provides funds to the Air Force Office of Scientific                Research for NSF's share of this jointly funded research project,               the principal investigator of which is Dr. Daniel Kahneman of the               Psychology Department of the University of California-Berkeley.                                                                                                 The research will study (1) the development of expectations about               objects that are observed on repeated occasions, and (2) the                    rules that govern the norms and standards to which people compare               objects and events, for example in judging that a duck is large,                or that an athlete moves awkwardly.  The research will employ a                 new experimental paradigm, the mini-event paradigm.  Observers                  facing a computer or TV screen will be exposed to a series of                   mini-events, in which one or two small objects are seen in motion               for 5-10 seconds.  The same \"individual\" objects will reappear                  periodically in a series of episodes.  The behavior of individual               objects will not be strictly repetitive, but each one will show                 some consistency, allowing observers to form distinct impressions               of each individual object.  Observers will rate each event on a                 scale of surprise, from \"highly surprising\" to \"completely                      unsurprising\".  Following a series of mini-events, observers will               be shown test events, and will compare each test event to a                     designated standard, for example \"evaluate how fast each object                 moves, relative to the speed with which objects of the same color               moved in the first series of events\".                                                                                                                           The surprise measure will provide a direct measure of the                       development of expectations, and, in properly designed series of                mini-events, answers to questions such as the following:  (i) How               quickly do expectations develop?  (ii) What are the long-term                   effects on expectations of a single instance of a behavior that                 is highly unusual for a particular object?  Will a recurrence of                that behavior after a long interval be judged relatively                        unsurprising?  (iii) When one object behaves in a new way, how                  does this affect the norms and expectations for the behavior of                 other objects?  The comparative judgments that will be obtained                 at the end of the session require the observer to form a                        representation of a collection of instances specified by the                    experimenter.  These judgments are similar to those commonly made               in everyday life, in which people are asked to think about                      arbitrary categories, for example, to answer a question about the               friendliness of neighbors on the other side of the street, or                   about the size of their dogs.  The experiments will explore the                 rules that determine which instances come to mind when we try to                construct such categories.  The experiments will also provide                   another measure of spontaneous categorization.  The expectation                 is that observers will be fastest and most accurate when they are               asked to relate a test event to its \"natural\" category, the one                 to which it would have been spontaneously assigned.",
