 "awd_abstract_narration": "The environment often contains a great deal of extraneous sound                 (noise) from which listeners nevertheless can sometimes extract                 information from particular sounds (signals).  The mechanisms by                which this is accomplished are still not well understood.  The                  importance of clarifying them is not only the basic scientific                  interest and in basic mechanisms working in auditory perception.                In many instances the extraneous sounds prevent the listener from               extracting information from the signal.  Knowing how to minimize                this problem is important in designing systems for auditory                     communication in many applications.                                                                                                                             In this project the investigator is attempting to test his                      hypothesis concerning this problem, which is that in listening we               compare sounds of various frequency regions (pitch) and different               intervals of time, weight them in some way, and separate the                    signal from the noise in analyzing the result.  He will present                 subjects with reproducible noise samples in which the frequency                 spectral and temporal fringes are systematically varied.  Using                 computers he will stimulate various models of excitation,                       inhibition and other interactions to determine which models (if                 any) accurately account for the effects observed by the                         listeners.",
