 "awd_abstract_narration": "Muscles are biological tranducers which convert chemical energy                 into mechanical energy-tension development during contraction.                  The higher the force and speed of contraction of a given muscle,                the greater the amount of chemical energy that is needed to                     sustain these contractions.  The major focus of this project is                 to look at the process of chemical energy production in muscles                 from a range of invertebrate species.  The results will provide                 fundamental information about energy transduction in muscle, in                 general and will give some insight into the evolution of these                  processes in the animal kingdom.  Chemical energy is derived from               two sources in muscles.  First of all, fuels such as                            carbohydrates and fats can be broken down yielding chemical                     energy.  Secondly, muscles contain chemicals known as phosphagens               which function as reservoirs of chemical energy.  It is this                    latter source of chemical energy that is the focus of this                      research effort.  There are a number of different kinds of                      phosphagens which are distributed in specific patterns in the                   animal kingdom.  Little is known about the chemical properties of               most of these phosphagens.  However, we do know that these                      phosphagen are used to power rapid and forceful muscle                          contractions.  These studies will investigate the biochemical                   properties of these phosphagens with an emphasis on how they are                utilized during muscle work.  In recent years, it has become                    apparent that the interior of muscle cells, and for that matter                 all cells, consists of an elaborate network of tubules,                         organelles and membranes.  Traditional methods of study of                      chemical energy production utilize invasive techniques which                    involve destruction of this complex intracellular architecture.                 To avoid this problem, he plans to use nuclear magnetic resonance               or spectroscopy, a method which allows us to observe chemical                   reactions in intact, living cells.  NMR techniques have been                    shown to be extremely useful in basic research as well as in the                context of the clinical environment.  These studies will extend                 our knowledge concerning the applicability of NMR methods for the               study of chemical energy production in muscles.",
