The Space Physics Research                         Laboratory is a broad interdisciplinary research organization                   which is part of the Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences academic                    department of the University of Michigan.  Research undertaken in               the laboratory spans several fields of engineering and                          geophysical sciences, with an emphasis on the observation and                   understanding of the physical processes which control the                       gaseous, plasma and liquid envelopes of the Earth and planetary                 bodies.  The annual research budget of the laboratory is                        approximately $8M and major funding comes from the National                     Science Foundation and NASA as well as other agencies.  Because                 of the strong ties to the academic environment at the University,               and its presence within a geosciences department in the College                 of Engineering, the Space Physics Research Laboratory has always                maintained active interest in providing significant undergraduate               and graduate research opportunities, particularly in the areas of               Solar-Terrestrial research and Aeronomy.  This grant will expand                and consolidate the undergraduate involvement by continuing                     support a very successful REU (Research Experiences for                         Undergraduates) site within the Laboratory.  The continued REU                  site will involve the direct participation of 12 faculty members                who have all had previous experience with the training of                       undergraduate students in research.  Funding will provide support               for 16 students, of whom half will be from institutions other                   than the University of Michigan.  Because of its commitment to                  high-quality undergraduate education, the University has agreed                 to waive indirect costs on this program for the first year.  The                rich variety and significance of the research carried out within                the Laboratory and the commitment of time on the part of the                    faculty participants will provide the undergraduates of the                     program a significant opportunity to have hands-on experience in                active and exciting research areas.",
