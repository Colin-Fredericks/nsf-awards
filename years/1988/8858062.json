 "awd_abstract_narration": "The advent of focusable subpicosecond laser pulses of energy greater            than about 1 mJ has made possible a wide range of studies of laser-             matter interactions at extremely high intensity and under very fine             time resolution.  The high repetition rate of these lasers allows the           use of low noise correlation techniques such as pump-probe methods.             The combination of high pulse energy and short duration makes possible          the measurement of the electrical properties of solid materials over            their transition from quantum solids to high temperature solid density          plasmas.  Recently, the resistivity of solid aluminum up to 106 oK has          been inferred from reflectivity measurements.  Onset toward and                 passage through a resistivity maximum at 200  -cm was observed as the           material disorder and electron temperature increased, the first direct          observation of this phenomenon.  This research is being extended to             materials exhibiting band absorption, such as copper, to study the              effects on plasma behavior of the condensed state.  Preliminary                 results indicate that considerable band absorption is still present             even at elevated electron temperatures ( 50 eV).  Short pulse                   continuum soft X-ray emission from these plasmas will be used to                perform time resolved studies of semiconductor and metal conduction             band plasmas, scattering from crystals with large atomic plane spacing          (such as KAP), time resolved EXAFS, and preliminary experiments on              pumping of soft X-ray laser transitions.  The effect of ultrahigh               fields on gases will be investigated by studying time-of-flight                 electron spectra and ion mass spectra from gases irradiated by                  energetic ultrashort pulses.  Of particular interest is the transition          of gas \"breakdown\" from the multiphoton ionization limit at low                 density to avalanche breakdown at high density.",
