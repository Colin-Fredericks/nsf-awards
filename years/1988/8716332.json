 "awd_abstract_narration": "Archaeological research in Mesoamerica has traditionally                   focused on the highland valleys of central Mexico and the Maya                  lowlands ignoring coastal zones.  This research project will                    begin to redress this bias.  The student will study human ecology               and interregional interactions in the Rio Verde valley on the                   coast of Oaxaca, Mexico.  He will excavate three Late Formative                 sites and conduct sedimentological sampling in the floodplain.                       Patterns of resource exploitation will be examined to                      determine how the coastal region differed from highland                         populations in resource use and how this affected interactions                  between the two ecological zones.  Specifically, the student will               address the important issue of how late Preclassic highland                     population growth and agricultural intensification affected                     coastal areas.                                                                       This study will provide crucial information on the                         prehistory of the Mixteca Costa and its relationship to other                   areas of Oaxaca.  Collecting data concerning both social and                    geomorphological interactions between the Rio Verde valley and                  the highland populations centered at Monte Alban will add to our                understanding of highland-lowland and primary state-secondary                   state interactions.",
