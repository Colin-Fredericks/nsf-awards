 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technological advances over the past few years have produced some               remarkable changes in laboratory instrumentation.   It is essential             that undergraduate science students develop a thorough understanding of         both the theoretical and practical aspects of modern computer-                  controlled/computer-interfaced instrumentation.  One of the most                powerful instrumental methods for separating and identifying the                components of a complicated mixture is Gas Chromatography/Mass                  Spectrometry (GC/MS).   Students of chemistry, biology and other                sciences are being educated in the theory, operation, practices and             capabilities of this powerful technique.  GC/MS is being introduced             into analytical and organic chemistry during the sophomore year.  Six           upper-level courses are being improved to give the student ample                opportunity to gain proficiency in the technique.  The infrastructure           of science is being strengthened when young scientists no longer have           to remove, in graduate schools and in industrial laboratories,                  deficiencies accumulated as undergraduates because of the lack of the           state-of-the-art instructional scientific equipment.                                                                                                            The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.",
