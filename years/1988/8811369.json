 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evaluating the causes of variation within and between                      communities is the major problem in community ecology.  Dr. Menge               will investigate community regulation in the low intertidal zone                on the central Oregon coast.  These studies are aimed at                        determining the factors regulating the spatial structure of                     plant-dominated assemblages at sites differing in exposure to                   waves.  Use of factorial experimental designs will permit                       quantitative evaluation of the relative importances of each of                  several factors, and will provide tests of a recent                             multifactorial model of community regulation.  Factors evaluated                will be predation, disturbance, competition, recruitment,                       sedimentation, and physiological stress.  Specific goals are: (1)               determination of the causes of variation in distribution of                     surfgrass along a wave exposure gradient, (2) quantification                    of gradients of environmental stress and recruitment density,                   (3) determination of mechanisms of disturbance, (4) experimen-                  tal studies of the mechanisms underlying plant overgrowth, and                  (5) recolonization of surfgrass in relation to clearance size                   and position.",
