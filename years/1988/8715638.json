 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation project will support an investigation           of self-settling refugees, those resettling without international aid,          in the African nation of Sudan.  Fieldwork will focus on class                  distinctions, the identification of primary mode of production,                 the economics of support networks, social integration and conflict, and         repatriation versus permanent resettlement.                                          The purpose of the project is to assess changes in rural market            activity and labor relations after a major influx of self-settling              refugees.  The investigators believe that most self-settling refugees           move from an independent mode of subsistence production to increased            involvement in the local economy, particularly during long term asylum.         They will examine this proposition and others in order to produce a             better explanation of the changing nature of the resettlement process           and its relationship to regional development.                                        Coups, countercoups, revolutions, ethnic conflicts and devastating         nature disasters have produced sizeable refugee populations in Africa           and throughout the world.  This project will increase our understanding         of the problem of refugee resettlement in the context of regional               development in Sudan and other nations.  It will also contribute to our         understanding of the effectiveness of technical aid policies and                programs.",
