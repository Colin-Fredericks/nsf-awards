 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop is to answer the two most critical questions                      raised in the original April 18-19 workshop on incineration,                    i.e., the apparent lack of success in measuring the criteria                    pollutants with existing continuous monitoring techniques, as                   well as the inadequacy of current commercial NOx removal                        systems.                                                                                                                                                        Once the current monitoring failures in the field are                           analyzed by a group of specialists and industrial users, the                    diagnostics experts will bring in their experience from other                   applications and will identify the basic research needs of                      incineration diagnostics.  Furthermore, a low rate of                           performance has been identified in the various techniques of                    elimination of nitric oxides.  A critical review of such                        equipment is timely, in particular from the viewpoint of the                    weaknesses and needs of the current data base in designing                      effective equipment.                                                                                                                                            The resolution of these two major areas of concern will help                    the waste incineration industry enter a predicted phase of                      rapid growth with the proper knowledge base for the design of                   safe and                                                                        efficient equipment.",
