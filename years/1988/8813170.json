 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reaction kinetic models to which cybernetic variables (calculated               using simple macroeconomic principles) have been added to                       represent the internal regulation of the syntheses and activities               of key enzymes for competing metabolic processes are shown to                   successfully describe a variety of growth situations in mixed                   (substitutable) substrate systems.  A dynamically evolving                      cybernetic framework is presented for modeling metabolic                        regulation in which transport, reaction, and product formation                  compete for cellular material and energy resources with evidence                that observations on abrupt switches in metabolic pathways,                     metabolic lags, exotic (oscillatory) dynamics, etc., can all be                 accommodated by these models.  A program is on-going which will                 provide detailed observations of enzyme levels, cell mass, biotic               and abiotic substrate, and product concentrations, etc., which                  will be compared with model predictions under various situations.               These situations include different patterned changes in the                     abiotic phase in fed batch and continuous cultures.                                                                                                             Microorganisms respond to their environment in ways that are                    controlled by a very elaborate and complex internal mechanism                   mediated by important molecules of the cell, such as DNA, RNA, and              many others.  In modeling microbial processes responsible for the               many products of biotechnology, account must be made of such                    metabolic regulation.  Evidence is present from past work that                  metabolic regulation can be described simply using macroeconomic                principles.  An extensive research program is now developing                    various aspects of this idea in modeling processes important to                 modern biotechnology.",
