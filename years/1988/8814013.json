 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the processing of liquid crystals dispersed in            amorphous polymers that can be used for reversible optical data                 storage.  The working principle is based on the competitive                     processes of phase separation and vitrification.  Such liquid                   crystal doped polymer mixtures are spin-coated on substrates to                 form thin films, whose interfacial morphology is strongly                       controlled by their transient thermal histories.  Both modeling                 and experimental studies are carried out to establish a firm                    understanding of this program.                                                                                                                                  Current thin films used in the computer industry are primarily                  inorganic in nature.  Transition metal/rare earth alloys suffer                 from ease of corrosion and expensive vacuum deposition processes.  The          organic based material being developed in this project enjoys the               advantage of formation by simple spin coating and long-term stability.          The use of liquid crystals in amorphous matrices exploits the strong            tendency of the liquid crystals to self- assemble and the rigid,                amorphous matrices to trap the transient morphology upon                        vitrification.  Subtle differences in the thin film interfacial                 morphology can lead to large, easily discernible light scattering               patterns, yielding high signal-to-noise ratios.  In addition, the               preliminary work performed to date on this novel                                liquid-crystal-in-polymer system indicates that fast data recording             and erasure can be achieved.",
