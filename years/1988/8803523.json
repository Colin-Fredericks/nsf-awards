 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funding to study the faulting processes                of six large earthquakes with magnitudes between 6.5 and 7.9 that               have occurred with the Baikal rift zone between 1950 and 1967.                  This will be accomplished through waveform modeling of regional                 and teleseismic body waves and surface wave analysis.  Additional               constraints on fault geometry and the rupture process will be                   obtained from available geological and geophysical studies of the               rift.  The earthquakes of interest occurred in regions of the rift              that are contemporaneously in different stages of evolution,                    ranging from the well established central rift graben to incipient              rifting at 121 degrees E, where no extensional features appear at               the surface.  Study of the faulting processes within each region                of the rift will lead to a better understanding of how faulting in              a rift evolves and will allow comparison of these regions with                  other continental rifts that are in different stages of evolution.              In addition, analysis of the 1957 M=7.9 Muya, Siberia earthquake,               one of the largest earthquakes to have occurred in an intraplate                setting since 1900, will provide important information for seismic              hazard assessment in other regions of continental rifting.",
