 "awd_abstract_narration": "A computer graphics system will be acquired for macromolecular                  structure-function analysis.  The instrument will be used to                    support a variety of research projects in biochemistry and                      molecular biology.  Among the projects to be supported are:  1)                 the structure of a flavoprotein dehydrogenase;  2) enzymes                      involved in carbon dioxide metabolism, notably ribulose                         bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase;  3) hemoprotein model com-                  pounds for hemoglobin and cytochromes;  4) drug-nucleic acid                    interaction;  5) metallothionein;  6) fibronectin;  7) NADPH-                   cytochrome C P-450 reductase;  8)  acetyl-CoA synthesis; and 9)                 mechanism of aconitase.  The research projects employ a variety                 of physical, chemical and biochemical methods for providing                     structural and functional information of the macromolecules                     being studied, with the emphasis being placed on the                            interpretation of X-ray diffraction data and NMR data.                                                                                                          A fully interactive, high resolution computer graphics system                   is an indispensable adjunct to three dimensional structure                      analysis of biological macromolecules.  This system will be                     used for working on the detailed atomic structure of                            crystallized proteins (by fitting models to electron density                    maps), for providing detailed analysis of the mode of binding                   of ligands or substrates to proteins and enzymes, for                           performing protein structure comparisons, for modeling                          protein-ligand and enzyme-substrate interactions, and for                       visualizing macromolecular structural details in an accurate                    and informative manner.  The results of the molecular                           representations allow a more detailed understanding                             of macromolecular structure to emerge and contribute to our                     fundamental understanding of the functional role of proteins                    and to current efforts in biotechnology.",
