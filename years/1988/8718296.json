 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Northwestern University will allow the investigator               to conduct methodological research on the effects of cluster                    sampling on the inferential procedures associated with log-linear               analysis of cross-cultural survey data.  The proposed research                  will examine the design effects of cluster sampling on 10-1                     variables and on a large number of two- and three-way contingency               tables for these variables.  The design effects will be used to                 estimate the amount of bias in rejection rates.  The study will                 be repeated on three cross-cultural samples varying in size,                    number of clusters, and geographical spread.  Results from this                 analysis will be compared with the results obtained using a                     modification of a recently developed jacknife procedure that                    takes into account complex clustering and yuields robust and                    efficient inference.                                                                                                                                            This research is important because cross cultural research is a                 major part of comparative research, and the methodological                      problems of comparing cultures across the world are significant.                This project promises to advance our understanding of \"Galton's                 problem\", or the problem of how one can make inferences from                    cases where each case may not be totally independent of the                     others.",
