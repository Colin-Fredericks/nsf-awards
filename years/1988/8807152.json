 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three-dimensional manifolds appeal to us at a very basic                   level, but they are very difficult to understand.  There are many               ways to construct examples of 3-manifolds, but the simplest sorts               of questions about the constructed manifolds often cannot be                    answered.  For example, it is very difficult to tell whether two                construction schemes yield the same or different manifolds.                          What is needed is a computable collection of invariants                    which distill the vast amount of information contained in the                   three-manifold into a useable form.  The standard invariants,                   Euler characteristic, homology, fundamental group, either contain               almost no information or are very difficult to work with.                            Hyperbolic 3-manifolds are the most important and most                     complicated class of geometric 3-manifolds.  The hyperbolic                     structures on these manifolds can be used to describe such                      invariants as the Chern-Simons invariant, the volume, and the                   eta-invariant.  By Mostow's theorem, these geometric invariants                 are actually topological invariants, at least in the closed case.               Recent research indicates that these invariants may be very                     useful in helping us to understand 3-manifolds.                                      This project mounts a multi-sided attack on understanding                  these invariants.",
