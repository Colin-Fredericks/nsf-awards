 "awd_abstract_narration": "Improvements in the static and aseismic design of steel-framed                  structures are hindered by the inability to simulate adequately their           three-dimensional nonlinear response to monotonic, nonproportional,             and cyclic loadings.  This research involves the development of                 advanced finite element and computer graphics capabilities for the              analysis of steel frame subassemblies, and the application of these             research tools to achieve a better understanding of the full-range              behavior of structural steel frames.  The effects of initial                    imperfections and residual stresses, spread of plasticity, the                  detailed constitutive response of structural steel to nonproportional           and cyclic straining, inelastic nonuniform torsion and torsional-               flexural coupling, cross-section distortion, joint deformations, and            the interaction of local and overall instabilities will each be                 modeled and studied.  Computer graphics techniques will be developed            for monitoring and control of nonlinear simulations and for animation           and visualization of the complex three-dimensional phenomena modeled            by the planning and interpretation of experimental tests, the                   extension of experimental knowledge to a wide range of geometries and           loadings, and the development and calibration of approximate models             for non-linear analysis of large frame structures.",
