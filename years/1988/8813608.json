 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work addresses both scientific issues and technological problems           related to hyperthermophilic archaebacteria, their metabolic                    processes, and associated biomolecules.  The genus, Pyrococcus (which           includes two species:  Pyrococcus furiosus and Pyrococcus woesei), is           comprised of anaerobic heterotrophs growing optimally at approximately          100\u001a C.  Given the rapid growth rates and relatively high cell yields           for the bacteria in this genus, it represents an important                      biotechnological opportunity for the isolation of thermostable enzymes          and for biotransformations at elevated temperatures.  Work will focus           on optimization of growth rate and biomass yield, engineering analyses          of important metabolic characteristics, and on efforts to identify              enzymes of potential industrial significance.                                                                                                                   The results from this study will be important in solving the myrid of           engineering problems associated with large-scale cultivation  and               utilization of hyperthermophilic microorganisms (i.e., those capable            of growth at or above 100\u001a C).  These recently discovered bacteria are          not yet well characterized but hold great potential from a                      biotechnological perspective.  Studies, such as the one described               here, are important in providing a basis on  which research in this             emerging area can develop.",
