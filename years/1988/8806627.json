 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerical work is proposed to help resolve outstanding problems                 in the fractionally quantized Hall states of two-dimensional                    electrons in strong magnetic fields.  Such states are realized in               semiconductor MOSFETS and hetrostructure devices which, apart                   from applied perspective, are valuable testing grounds for the                  understanding of physical phenomena in the extreme quantum limit                where cooperative effects occur.  In particular, the project                    addresses questions on:  the off-diagonal long range                            correlations; the reversed spin excitations and their importance                to even denominator rational Landau-level occupations; the                      approach to the classical limit of a Wigner crystal; and, the                   role of disorder in degradation of the fractional quantum Hall                  states.                                                                         Also proposed is a finite-size study of planar antiferromagnets                 on both square and triangular lattices.  The square lattice                     systems are realized in the oxygen-copper layers of high                        temperature superconductors and are deemed important to the                     ultimate understanding of superconducting mechanism.  Detailed                  studies of the ground state and the excitation spectrum plus the                effect and the behavior of holes in the frustrated model with                   next-neighbor antiferromagnetic coupling have been proposed.  A                 parallel study of the excitation spectrum of the triangular                     antiferromagnet where very strong quantum fluctuation effects are               also present will be carried out.",
