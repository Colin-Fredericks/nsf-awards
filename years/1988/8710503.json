 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although a relatively small percentage of civil damage lawsuits are             disposed of by jury trial, the verdicts that juries return have a               significance to the civil justice process that is far out of proportion         to their numbers.  They represent the visible portion of the decisions          that are reached by participants in civil actions and are frequently            cited as indicators of trends and developments in the entire civil              claims system, not simply the activities that take place in courtrooms.         However, research focusing on civil jury verdicts has been seriously            hampered by the lack of sound empirical data, organized in ways that            are amenable to statistical processing and analysis.  Recognition that          there has been a dearth of useable data led to the decision by the              Institute for Civil Justice to undertake a large-scale data collection          project focusing on jury verdicts from selected jurisdictions in                Illinois and California and including comprehensive data on more than           25,000 civil damage cases between 1960 and 1985.  The result of that            data collection is the Jury Verdicts Data Base.                                                                                                                 Specifically, Dr. Dungworth seeks to create and document Public Use             Tapes containing a cleaned and edited version of the Jury Verdicts Data         Base.  These data will be located in a public archive and made                  available for distribution to the research community.  Through making           accessible a rich body of data in an area ripe for new empirical work,          this project holds substantial promise of advancing our understanding           of the civil litigation process, its costs, and its outcomes.",
