 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is a short course intended to immerse faculty in the                methods and implications of teaching and applying engineering design            graphics (EDG) with microcomputer-based graphics workstations and               professional computer-aided design drafting (CADD) software.                    Participants will be guided through lesson plans, exercises, and                computer-assisted grading strategies utilized in a highly successful and        innovative instructional program for EDG instruction in the University          of Illinois College of Engineering.  The micro-CADD experience will             include producing, modifying and interpreting graphic representations.          It will also emphasize database implications of CADD and the use of CADD        as an effective graphical interface to advanced systems for CAD, CAM,           CAE, CIM, etc.  This approach reflects the growing awareness that the           effective application of CAD, etc. depends in large part on an                  individual's ability to visualize \"objects\" and to create and interpret         them in graphic form.  The course will include lecture-demonstrations in        a specially equipped micro-CADD auditorium featuring a large-screen             projection monitor.  Individual laboratory assignments will take place          on PC-based micro-CADD workstations, during which experienced graduate          teaching assistants will assist the instructors in offering individual          help and advice.  The project directors will maintain personal contact          with participants to foster success after the course.                                                                                                           In addition to NSF funds, participants' institutions will provide about         30% in travel costs toward the operation of the project.",
