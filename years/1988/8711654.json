 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research revolves around two approaches to understanding the                physical determinants of motility.  One approach examines the physics           of propulsion from an engineering standpoint.  Forces generated by              appendage movements are used to estimate thrust and body trajectories           for a variety of situations, including aerial, aquatic, and terrestrial         locomotion.  A goal is to determine what motions and body morphologies          are feasible for accomplishing certain movements such as flight,                swimming, or running and the limitations to movements in terms of               design and energetics.                                                                                                                                          A  second approach centers upon the physiology of the muscles that              generate locomotor movements.  A number of important limitations to             muscle contractility have been shown with the maxima for force and the          inverse relationship between the force and velocity of contraction both         etermining overall muscle and appendage motions.                                                                                                                While both above approaches have yielded fruitful insight into the              limitations to animal motility, no previous study has explicitly linked         these two components.  Daniel proposes to combine these two areas to            determine both physical and physiological limitations to one extreme            mode of locomotion: escape from predation.  We use a local species of           shrimp, Pandalus danae, that exhibits an escape motion involving a              rapid flexion of the abdomen that lasts approximately 30 ms.  The               hydrodynamics of this mode of locomotion has already been worked out.                                                                                           He has shown that both the size and shape of these animals are                  constrained by the dynamics of accelerational locomotion. He proposes           to address basic questions regarding these and related contractile              systems:  (1) What are the forces generated by such rapidly contracting                                                                                         muscles (2) How do active and inactive antagonistic muscle groups               respond to such rapid extensions? and (3) How is this activity                  regulated and transferred into productive motility.",
