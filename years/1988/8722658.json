 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a research visit by Dr. Kay Nakamaye of Gonzaga             University to the Max Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine in             Goettingen, FRG, to gain experience in the synthesis of nucleotides             and to collaborate with Dr. Fritz Eckstein, a leader in the field of            nucleic acid chemistry who has pioneered the use of                             phosphorothioates.  Their cooperative research will focus on the use            of phosphorothioates in improved procedures for recombinant DNA                 manipulation; specifically, they are interested in the effect of                phosphorothioates incorporated into DNA on cleavage by restriction              endonucleases.  In previous collaboration, they developed a simple              yet efficient method of producing site-specific mutations in isolated           DNA fragments or genes.  However, one of the limitations of the                 technique is the need for a specific DNA sequence for the restriction           endonuclease to be used, preferably near the site of the intended               mutation. They now plan to study class IIS restriction endonucleases            as a strategy for directing both the mutation and the position of               nicking by the endonuclease.  This would make their mutagenesis                 technique nearly universal for any DNA and DNA sequence.                                                                                                        Development of mutagenesis techniques has become essential to                   investigations in areas such as protein structure-function                      relationships, gene control and regulation, and DNA/RNA structure.              Gene isolation, characterization and manipulation are fundamental               components of many biotechnologies.  Any further techniques for such            work will continue to have great value in basic and applied research.",
