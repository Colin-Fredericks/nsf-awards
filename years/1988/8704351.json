 "awd_abstract_narration": "Males of many species often have colorations and                        morphologies that are different from females.  Darwin proposed                  that these differences were due to sexual selection; that is, the               characteristics were associated with increased mating success.                  There are two sources of sexual selection; one arises from                      competition between males for mates, and the other from female                  choice of mates,  This proposal uses a series of experiments                    based on transplants of males among local populations to                        differentiate those male characteristics that are shaped by                     competition from those shaped by female choice.   This question                 has never been approached in systematic fashion before, and                     should greatly increase our understanding of the dynamics of                    sexual selection.                                                                       An equally important factor affecting sexual selection is               the cost  to a female for exercising a choice of mates.   Dr.                   Warner will investigate these costs in terms of the resultant                   mortality and fertilization rates that result from different                    choices.",
