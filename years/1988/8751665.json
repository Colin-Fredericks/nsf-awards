 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine the degree to which the socialization                 practices of Asian American parents foster motivational and attitudinal         tendencies that contribute to high achievement in mathematics and               science in their children.  In five studies, spanning grades 2-12,              Asians are directly contrasted with caucasians in similar environments          on background, attitudes, and achievement, with due attention to                socioeconomic and immigration related influences.                                                                                                               The researchers have previously developed questionnaires to measure both        home rearing experiences and naive theories of education.  Predicted            findings are that by mid-childhood Asians will demonstrate                      precociousness for realism of self-evaluation and awareness of their            ability as compared to their peers.  In the pubertal period the                 prediction is that Asians will show a greater prevalence of adaptive            beliefs and a lower incidence of helplessness.  In adolescence the              prediction is that as a concomitance of attributional differences there         is a more mature pattern of time perspective, sensation seeking, and the        perception of tasks as contingent for success.  Throughout the project          objective indices of achievement will be used to evaluate how much of           within group variance is accounted for by the sociological constructs.          In making recommendations the investigators will be sensitive to the            need to neither homogenize descriptions of Asians nor overlook negative         costs of socialization such as incidence of adolescent anxiety and              depression.                                                                                                                                                     A hope of this project, in view of the underachievement in American             schools in technologically relevant education, is to identify a set of          child rearing practices which will help every child make the most of            educational resources.  These child rearing practices  should be                adaptable by individual parents and worthy of attention by community            leaders among the disadvantaged.  The ultimate aim of the project is to         suggest a foundation for intervention in the social situations which            produce failure.",
