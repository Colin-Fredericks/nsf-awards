 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Disaster Research Center (DRC) is undertaking a study of the                preparedness and response patterns of lifeline organizations in                 community disasters.  Under \"lifeline\" DRC is looking at groups                 usually known as public utilities (e.g., electric, gas, water,                  telephone companies), public works (e.g., streets and roads,                    sanitation and garbage, sewerage) and public transportation                     organizations (e.g., bus, subway, railway, taxicab companies).  Their           planning for and their emergency time actions in community wide crises          emanating from disaster agents is being examined in on-site field               studies.  Data from intensive open ended interviewing, participant              observing and document collecting are being gathered on the                     characteristics (structure and function) of lifeline organizations,             their interorganizational relationships with other disaster relevant            groups, the social factors or conditions which result in these                  features, and the consequences for both group and community                     preparedness and disaster management.  Besides filling in a lacuna              about disaster relevant groups, the research will allow an analysis of          how the activities of lifeline organizations affect the planning and            response of other local emergency oriented groups, and provide the              complementary social science side to the work being done on the                 engineering and technical aspects of lifeline systems.  Special                 attention will be given to earthquakes especially since lifeline                systems are usually heavily impacted in such disasters.",
