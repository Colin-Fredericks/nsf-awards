 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is intended to increase our understanding of ways to deter         criminal action.  It is a systematic study of the effects of                    neighborhood structure on the interaction between police and criminals,         the proper level of aggregation necessary to delineate this                     interaction, and the lag time that occurs between criminal                      responsiveness to police sanctions and police responses to criminal             behavior patterns.  In this collaborative project, Drs. Kohfeld and             Sprague investigate the mutual interaction between police and criminals         by means of a measurement procedure that accounts for the differential          time pattern of response.  The uniquely rich and detailed data set they         develop for carrying out these analyses is drawn from the St. Louis             Metropolitan Police Department.  The data set spans the time period             1970 through 1982 and is characterized by a very fine time structure--          the unit for crime occurrence is hours and the unit for arrests is              days--and a very fine geographic structure--the place of each crime and         each arrest is identified by X-Y coordinates and can be located as to           census blocks, blockgroups, and tracts.  Drs. Kohfeld and Sprague               utilize an innovative geo-based software program for graphic display            and analysis to aid them in their examination of criminal and police            interactions under varying demographic conditions.                                                                                                              By modelling both the offender and police reactions to one another at           the incident level, the project has the potential to make a major               advance in our knowledge of deterrence processes, which is central to           understanding the social control and enforcement functions of law.              Modelling this action-reaction process within social contexts will              explain why the criminal justice system works better or differently in          some places than in others and why crime is exhibited or can be                 deterred more effectively in some sites.",
