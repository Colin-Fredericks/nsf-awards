 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clothing is used in every culture to express ethnic and                    cultural identity.  It is heavily laden with symbols that often                 function along social lines.  This research project will focus on               the use of cloth and textiles in establishing and maintaining                   cultural identity among marginalized ethnic groups in developing                countries with significant out-migration.  Specifically the                     researcher will look at the Andean groups in Sacaca, Bolivia in                 order to study the socio-economic conditions of textile                         production and use.                                                                  Textiles are also becoming important economically.  The                    study will investigate the productive roles of Andean women, who                weave textiles for the international market in ethnic art.                           This research will advance studies of the semiotic and                     economic aspects of cultural systems.  While there is extensive                 literature on the technical and iconographic features of Andean                 textiles, little research has been done on meaning and cloth's                  place in the cultural system in a political, economic, and                      historical context.",
