 "awd_abstract_narration": "The availability of a large quantity of long-period digital                seismic data has played a major role in recent advances in our                  understanding of the large-scale aspherical structure of the                    Earth.  Many new models exist which have been designed to fit                   these data.  They succeed to various degrees but it is                          indisputable that much of the signal in the data remains to be                  explained.  One reason for this is that approximate theoretical                 formulations have been used to intepret the data.  In this                      proposal, we describe techniques of data analysis which can avoid               most approximations and we illustrate how well some approximate                 techniques are capable of performing.  The application of these                 techniques to a large dataset will lead to many integral                        constraints on aspherical structure which we call structure                     coefficients.  These structure coefficients can also be used to                 compute three-dimensional Green's functions for accurate studies                of long-period source mechanisms.",
