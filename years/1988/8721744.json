 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. John Moore and John Tossel from University of Maryland,                 and Dr. Judith Giordan, an employee of Aluminum Company of                      America are supported by a grant from The Physical Chemistry                    Program to study various aspects of the interaction of low                      energy electrons with gas phase molecules.  An improved                         understanding of physical processes of this type has important                  commercial implications in the plasma etching and plasma                        deposition industry.                                                                                                                                               Moore and coworkers are studing three separate aspects of                    electron molecule interactions.  Electron Transmission                          Spectroscopy (ETS) is being used to study the low lying                         unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels (LUMO's) which are                   of fundamental importance in explaining pi bonding and chemical                 reactivity.  This research group has also recently modified                     their basic ETS instrument to make measurements of total                        inelastic cross sections for electron scattering.  Measurements                 which have required many painstaking hours to collect in other                  laboratories are now possible to obtain in about 30 seconds                     using only a slight modification of the original instrument.                                                                                                       Inner Shell Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (ISEELS) is                    being used to study the lowest lying unoccupied molecular                       orbitals of the molecular cation.  ISEELS involves the trapping                 of knocked-out inner shell electrons in the valence region of                   the molecular energy levels.  Moore and coworkers have found a                  definite and chemically important correlation between the                       results of the ETS and ISEELS spectra.                                                                                                                             New experiments are also being conducted in the area of free                 radical reactions.  Moore and coworkers have found that they                    can produce reasonably intense molecular beams of neutral free                  radicals by dissociative electron attachment followed by                        removal of the charged anionic fragmentation products.  They                    plan to study the reactions of the product free radicals with                   various target gasses.",
