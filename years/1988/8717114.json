 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues studies of mixed-species flocking in             birds wintering in temperate-deciduous forest and concerns the                  use of the newly-discovered technique of \"ptilochronology\".                     Ptilochronology indexes the degree of energy stress on a day-by-                day basis by measuring the rate of growth of a feather replacing                one that has been intentionally plucked.  For birds during the                  non-breeding season, the rate of feather growth is related to net               energy intake, and can be used to monitor energy stress, the                    culmination of which is death.  The rate of feather growth can be               viewed as a sensitive indicator of the risk of starvation and,                  therefore, can be treated as a direct measure of the adaptiveness               of behavior.  Ptilochronology will be used to assess the degree                 of energy stress experienced by birds foraging in conspecific and               heterospecific flocks of controlled composition.  The technique                 holds promise for answering many other fundamental questions in                 avian ecology.//",
