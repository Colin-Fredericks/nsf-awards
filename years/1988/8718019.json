Hodson will continue his studies on the                 microbial transformations and fate of lignocellulose in marine                  waters and sediments.  Lignocellulose is a major component of                   coastal and estuarine marine plants and resulting decomposition                 products.  Thus, it represents a potentially major source of                    carbon to the marine food web.  However, lignocellulose is highly               refractory to microbial degradation and indigestible to most                    animals.  Microbial transformations to partial degradation                      products or microbial biomass or both is required before carbon                 from this abundant polymer can enter the food webs.  Hodson has                 developed several new methods for preparing and following the                   microbial transformations of specifically radiolabeled                          lignocelluloses from native marine plants in salt marshes and                   tropical mangrove swamps.  His studies have revealed basic                      differences in the fate of lignocellulose in marine and                         terrestrial/freshwater environments, and he and his colleagues                  have accumulated basic data on rates of lignocellulose                          mineralization under areobic and anaerobic conditions, and on the               relative efficiencies with which bacteria in several marine                     environments utilize carbon derived from lignocellulose.                                The present study will employ new methodologies for                     following lignin and lignocellulose transformations in marine                   environments and expand the research to examine the rates of                    production, efficiencies of bacterial utilization, and rates of                 turnover of dissolved organic compounds derived from the                        degradation of particulate detrital lignocelluloses.  The                       principal investigator will use a time-series approach to expand                his data set to include changes in biodegradability, rates of                   solubilization, and rates of incorporation into microbial biomass               of lignocellulosic detritus from salt marsh and mangrove marine                 environments over periods ranging from one month to several                     years.  This information will enable the accurate prediction of                 the persistence of lignocellulosic detrital material and its                    importance in the marine food web.",
