 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with the measurement of surface                 defects on either hard disk media or hard disk substrates.                      These defects can effect the performance of a computer disk as                  the head tracks over the surface.  The research concentrates on                 the measurement of surface defects on computer hard disks using                 non-contact optical scanning interferometry.  The primary                       objective of the Phase II research is to measure the defects                    under typical rotating  conditions of the disk.  The effects of                 the signal to noise ratio, signal bandwidth, laser spot size,                   and focusing errors will be studied for different disk rotation                 speeds.                                                                              The anticipated result of the Phase II research will be                    the development of a device for the characterization of one                     entire side of a computer hard disk surface.  There is the                      potential for a rapid non-contacting measurement technique of                   surface features of a finished hard disk or uncoated hard disk                  is the development of new measurement techniques and test                       equipment that will have the potential to improve the quality                   of computer hard disks.",
