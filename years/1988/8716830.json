 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds from the National Science Foundation to            purchase equipment for computer and information science and engineering         research in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Virginia Tech.          The requested equipment will provide researchers with a high quality            integrated circuit design system.  The three principal ivestigators             have recently joined the faculty and wish to initiate computer                  engineering research that requires such a VLSI design system.  The              capability is presently not available to the researchers.                                                                                                       The requested equipment is a VLSI design system consisting of                   workstation hardware and design automation software.  The equipment             will be used initially by four projects that span a range for research          areas.  Two projects will use the system to design circuits for use in          development, analysis, verification, and empirical studies of design            for testability and test generation techniques.  The third project              ivestigates to use of digital and analog processing on a single chip            for a biomedical computing application.  The remaining project involves         the design of a communications processor for use in multicomputers.                                                                                             The equipment will provide capabilities to allow the investigators to           contribute to the university and the national technology base.  The             equipment will significantly increase the capacity for research in the          areas of VLSI design, computer-aided design and test, and systems               architecture.",
