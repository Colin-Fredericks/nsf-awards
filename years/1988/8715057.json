Vibrational energy transfer is a key step in many chemical                      processes.  When it occurs in a fluid, the solvent can                          influence the rate.  The theoretical task is to predict this                    solvent dependence, which will be accomplished with a                           combination of semiclassical scattering and kinetic theory                      techniques.  When fluorophores are de-excited by quenchers, the                 rate of the process can depend on the quencher concentration in                 a nonlinear fashion.  Quenching with ionic species is                           especially important in protein fluorescence quenching and                      inorganic complex quenching.  Theories of this quencher                         concentration dependence will be developed using multiple                       scattering and simulation methods.  The nature of the                           solvation, dynamics and reactivity of electrons in fluids is a                  central chemical problem.  The electron's mobility as a                         function of fluid density will be investigated by techniques                    similar to those used in the quenching problems.",
