 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Moss Landing Marine Laboratory of San Jose State University                 will acquire several items of oceanographic instrumentation to be               placed in a pool of shared use equipment.  This equipment is                    maintained for use on or in association with the R/V POINT SUR, a               research vessel owned by the NSF and operated by the University.                A substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1988 is              in support of NSF-sponsored research projects.  The instrumenta-                tion will also increase the capabilities of the ship and of the                 institution to support research and engineering activities.  The                instrumentation includes:                                                                                                                                       -A pc computer system for increasing shared-use, sea-going                       computing capabilities,                                                        -replacement 10-liter and 5-liter water sampling bottles for                     collecting discrete seawater samples at specific depths,                       -several precision reversing thermometers, and                                  -a Rhubidium frequency standard to enhance scientific navigation                 capabilities.                                                                                                                                                  The instrumentation described above will increase the capability                of the organization to support NSF-sponsored research and                       engineering projects.",
