 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is for a conference on the foundations of Afro-                 American speech varieties (Black English, Gullah, and various                   Caribbean creole languages).  A basic controversy in the field is               the role, if any, of African substrate influence.  Issues to be                 addressed by a distinguished gathering of creolists, Africanists,               dialectologists, and other experts include: 1) How should the                   concept of \"African substratum\" be understood with respect to                   Afro-American speech varieties in light of recent developments in               the field?  2) What are the conditions under which substrate                    influence is likely to occur?  3) What correlation is there                     between linguistic and cultural Africanisms?  4) What other                     problems are involved in demonstrating African substrate                        influence?                                                                                                                                                           Mufwene is a leading scholar of African languages, pidgin                  and creole studies, and linguistics, and the two dozen                          participants who have agreed to participate represent every point               of view taken on the issue.  The topic under discussion is not                  only of concern to scholars but also to people of African descent               in North America and the Caribbean, since it deals directly with                the extent and type of survival of African language and culture                 through the experience of dislocation and enslavement.",
