 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part of the study is a theoretical program to investigate the                   spatial structure and complex dynamics in non-equilibrium systems               near the threshold of an instability at finite wavenumber.                      Considerable progress has been made for stationary instabilities,               exemplified by convection in pure fluids.  Experiments on                       convection in binary fluid mixtures provide the impetus for                     theoretical work on the rich behavior near the threshold of a                   dynamic instability.  The methods to be used are perturbational                 schemes leading to \"amplitude\" and \"phase\" equations; numerical                 solution of the full fluid equations to answer specific                         questions; and the numerical simulation of simpler model                        equations constructed to capture the important physics near the                 instabilities.  Although fluid systems provide convenient systems               for a careful comparison between theory and experiment, the                     results should have wide applicability in diverse fields.                                                                                                       The other part of the work will study bulk and interfacial                      Helium, both to understand the microscopic behavior of these                    simple but challenging model quantum systems, and to investigate                them as laboratories for novel physics in new parameter regimes,                where quantum effects dominate thermal, and collisional                         relaxation effects are often small.  Monte-Carlo methods provide                an important tool for investigating the microscopic physics, but                must be tied in with analytic phenomenology to yield any real                   understanding.  Interfacial Helium provides an interesting two-                 dimensional thermodynamic system, and has remarkable and                        experimentally vital transport behavior that remains poorly                     understood.",
