 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of thin film materials.  Although                 thin films comprise an extremely interesting and important class                of materials, techniques for chemical analysis which are specific               to thin films are currently inadequate.  In this research                       activity, Professor Bohn and his students will build on their                   progress under NSF grant CHE-8508722 to extend the use of                       nonclassical excitation phenomena for optical spectroscopy in thin              films at size scales from 5 angstroms to 5 micrometers.  This will              be accomplished by pursuing two separate research thrusts.  In                  one, gallium arsenide and aluminum-substituted gallium arsenide                 heterostructures will be used as dielectric optical waveguides to               perform frequency modulated cross section measurements at photon                energies just below the III-V bandgap.  The absorption                          measurements require the long pathlengths available only in                     optical waveguides, because the cross sections of the impurity                  related transitions in the sub-bandgap energy region of high                    purity III-V semiconductors is extremely weak.  In the second                   thrust, structure-function relationships in molecular monolayers                will be examined at dielectric surfaces.  A portion of this effort              will use surface plasmon mediated optical second harmonic                       generation and high precision reflectivity measurements to follow               the dynamics of monolayer formation.  Additionally, the capability              for examining Raman scattering from molecular monolayers on                     dielectric surfaces that is resident in Professor Bohn's                        laboratory will be used to probe the relationship between                       adsorbate molecular structure and film architecture on the                      supermolecular level.                                                                                                                                           This research impacts broadly on the technologically important                  area of III-V semiconductor devices.  These studies are expected                to yield new techniques for the characterization of trace                       impurities that determine the behavior of high purity                           semiconductors.  Additionally, this work should lead to an                      enhanced understanding of the interfacial structure of these                    materials and to insights into the dynamics of formation of these               multi-layered molecular structures which are of prime importance                to the electronics industry.",
