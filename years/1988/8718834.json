 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with the basic metallurgical                    mechanisms that affect sliding friction and wear of metals and                  alloys.  Previous results have identified a sequence of events                  which include plastic deformation, local transfer, mechanical                   mixing and debris generation.  These observations will be used to               develop wear equations based on physical phenomena.  Further                    research is proposed on the structure, composition and properties               of the mechanically-mixed material generated by sliding.  Some of               this work will be performed in cooperation with W. D. Nix at                    Stanford University.  In addition, the sliding behavior of                      semiconductor materials will be examined.  Differences in                       deformation and fracture behavior of n- and p-type materials are                expected to lead to differences in their friction and wear                      behavior.",
