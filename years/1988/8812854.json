 "awd_abstract_narration": "This longitudinal study investigates the simultaneous                           acquisition of English and Turkish by a child between the ages                  of 1 year, 8 months and 4 years, six months.  Comparisons will                  be made with the monolingual acquisition of each of these                       languages as well as the successive acquisition of English and                  Turkish, followed by the loss of Turkish between the ages of 2                  years, six months and 3 years, 3 months in a child previously                   studied.                                                                                                                                                        The project is of special interest among case studies in                        bilingual acquisition, because the two languages involved are                   typologically different.  It also provides one of the few                       comparisons of simultaneous and successive bilingual                            acquisition using the same pair of languages.  Findings will be                 relevant to theories of language acquisition and socialization,                 bilingualism, and relations between language and cognition in                   development.",
