 "awd_abstract_narration": "Models of production and inventory systems are frequently employed in           the design and performance studies of manufacturing systems.  Despite           their potential applicability, their use is not widespread.  This is            mainly due to the absence of comprehensive tools for analyzing                  manufacturing systems.                                                                                                                                          The proposed research aims at rectifying this situation by carrying             out the following three tasks:  1) Devise exact and approximate                 procedures for analyzing networks of production/inventory systems with          finite work-in-process inventories.  2) Develop exact algorithms to             study single-stage, multi-item production/inventory systems with (R,r)          inventory control policies and switch-over rules.  3) Incorporate the           algorithms developed in Part 2 into the approximation algorithms of             Part 1 to be able to study multi-stage, multi-item projection/                  inventory systems.",
