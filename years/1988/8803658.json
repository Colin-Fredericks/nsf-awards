 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Prof. James              Kolata of the University of Notre Dame and Dr. Eli Aguilera and Dr.             Jaime Vega of the Mexican National Institute for Nuclear Research               (ININ).  The goal of the research is to achieve a basic                         understanding of heavy-ion fusion.  Since atomic nuclei repel each              other strongly due to their electric charge, it is therefore                    necessary to supply a substantial amount of energy to the system to             make their surfaces come into contact so that fusion can proceed.               However, even if the surfaces do not touch, fusion may be                       accomplished through a process known as \"quantum-mechanical                     tunneling\", which forms the basis of several modern electronic                  devices.  In the nuclear case, simple theoretical models of the                 process do not quite predict the strong enhancement accomplished by             this \"sub-barrier\" fusion.  Several complicated and generally                   mutually incompatible explanations have been formulated to explain              this phenomenon but further study is needed to understand these                 effects.                                                                                                                                                        The proposed work is of high current interest because it represents             an important way in which the effect of internal degrees of                     freeedom on the quantum-mechanical tunneling process can be                     studied.  The proposed collaboration is an extension of previous                efforts and is well matched to the strengths and facilities at both             institutions.  Detailed experimental measurements will be carried               out at Notre Dame while the lengthy data-analysis phase of the work             will be done at ININ using a powerful new computer system at that               institute. The proposed work is likely to make a contribution to                the field of heavy ion physics.",
