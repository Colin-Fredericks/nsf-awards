Its purpose is to explore                   recent advances in harmonic analysis on both real and p-adic                    reductive groups.  The principal lecturers are Joseph Bernstein,                Roger Howe, Wilfred Schmid, and David Vogan who will give four                  series of lectures.  Each series will begin with an introduction                for young investigators in these areas and mathematicians in                    related areas, and will proceed to examine the present state of                 research.  There will be lectures by other experts, and ample                   time for discussions and informal work sessions.                                     Professor William Barker of Bowdoin College is the                         organizer.  Some participant support is available, including                    support for young investigators and graduate students.",
