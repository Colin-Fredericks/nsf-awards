 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. Raul A. Stern of the University of Colorado             and Dr. Nathan Rynn of the University of California at Irvine to                collaborate with Dr. M.Q. Tran and others of the Center for Research            in Plasma Physics of the Ecole Polytechnique Federale, Lausanne,                Switzerland in a study of the transition to stochasticity in                    non-equilibrium plasmas.  The program brings together researchers               who are carrying out active projects in this area individually, and             have already collaborated successfully on this topic.  Use will be              made of unique, newly-developed experimental facilities, including a            9-meter long plasma column, fully magnetized and super-uniform,                 which can operate both as a gas-discharge (high Te/Ti) and a                    quiescent (BaII) plasma, together with the newest laser-induced                 fluorescence diagnostic technologies.  Research will consist of                 plasma wave excitation on the ionic branches, together with                     measurements of ion velocity distributions and ion transport, to map            out the phase-space history of ions during wave-particle                        interactions.  Results will be coordinated with numerical studies.                                                                                              This collaborative project combines complementary skills and                    resources and exploits a unique, world class research facility in               Lausanne that was specially designed for experimental studies in                this field.  The topic of intrinsic stochasticity in wave-particle              interactions is a rapidly developing subject; it is central to                  fundamental plasma physics and it has direct applications to studies            of plasmas in astronomy and fusion research.",
