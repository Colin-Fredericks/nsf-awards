 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to determine if the detachment of                  bubbles in saturated nucleate boiling from a single site goes                   from periodic to chaotic through a reproducible sequence of                     bifurcations, with the purpose of searching for a suitable low-                 dimensional model of the phenomenon.  An experimental study of an               electrically heated cylindrical cavity will be performed to                     determine the periodicity.  The route from isolated bubbles to                  continuous vapor columns will be mapped.  A model based upon                    bifurcations and dynamical systems theory will be developed.                                                                                                    There are many mechanisms which are responsible for the heat                    transfer from a boiling surface to a saturated liquid.                          Theoretical studies of these processes recognize the importance                 of factors such as bubble frequency, nucleation site density and                bubble diameter.  They all depend on the heat flux, surface                     superheat and cavity size in ways that are not entirely                         understood.  The results of the present proposal will help in                   understanding part of the phenomenon by determining the frequency               with which vapor bubbles leave a nucleation site as well as its                 qualitative and quantitative change with heat flux.  It will be                 possible to find out whether the statistical distribution of                    bubble departure frequencies is due to deterministic chaos.  Thus               the experiments will also be vital in evaluating a low-                         dimensional model to simulate the process over a range of heat                  fluxes.",
