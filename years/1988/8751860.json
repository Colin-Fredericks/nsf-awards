 "awd_abstract_narration": "GREAT PROJECTS will be a six-part series of television programs on large        scale engineering in society, co-produced by SCETV and Manifold                 Productions for national PBS distribution.  The six one hour programs           will examine civil engineering projects from the perspectives of the            historical role of engineering, the risks and benefits of new projects,         and engineering's role in meeting humanity's future needs.                                                                                                      This series will be one of the few programs on public television which          has examined civil engineering from a wide perspective, and will be the         first to explicitly look at the benefits, costs and societal                    consequences of investment in large scale engineering and infrastructure        projects.  ln addition to informing and educating the public about the          field of civil engineering, it will serve to illustrate engineering             professions and to provide realistic role models for student career             choices.                                                                                                                                                        GREAT PROJECTS will be sponsored by the National Academy of Engineering,        which will convene a National Advisory Committee to insure balance,             accuracy and objectivity in the series' content.                                Substantial use will be made of professional, academic, and governmental        advisors and experts in preparation of its content.  Support for the            project will be raised from corporations, foundations and professional          societies; the National Science Foundation is providing approximately           l0% of the $3.8 million project total.",
