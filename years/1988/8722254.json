 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goal of this research is to critically examine the                relationship between the performance properties and the structure               and morphology of Langmuir-Blodgett (L-B) films and their                       precursor monolayers in order to determine the prerequisite                     conditions for obtaining L-B films having improved properties for               use as chemical microsensors.  The transport of electronic charge               through a phthalocyanine L-B film is extremely sensitive to the                 morphology or organization of the phthalocyanine units.                         Therefore, it is essential to characterize and control the                      morphology of the multilayer film in order to optimize the                      electrical response performance.  Attention in this project                     focuses on characterizing monolayer and L-B films by further                    developing and applying in-situ optical diagnostic techniques, in               particular, laser fluorescence techniques, to monitor the                       monolayer microhomogeneity and morphology.  By carefully                        controlling and determining the morphology and structure of the                 phthalocyanine films, the investigators will be in a unique                     position to determine the relationship between sensor response                  and L-B film morphology.                                                        The development of chemiresistor technology based on very thin                  organic semiconductor films deposited onto planar microelectrode                arrays by the Langmuir-Blodgett (L-B) technique offers the                      advantage of enhanced sensitivity to detect chemical gases of                   industrial and technological importance.  This project, is                      successful, should help in the design of improved gas-sensitive                 films for a variety of applications.",
