 "awd_abstract_narration": "New models on optical interconnections that accurately reflect the              limitations imposed on high-speed systems are being studied.  Emphasis          is placed on the excitation response of the interconnection network,            rather than on the dynamics of the active devices.  This greatly                simplifies the analysis and avoids excessive computational effort.              VLSI systems are represented by a hierarchical model that satisfies the         observed power law relationship between circuit complexity and                  interconnection count.  Closed form expressions that model the behavior         of optical interconnections are being developed.  These expressions             allow a comparison between the operational performance of new                   interconnect strategies and that of their electrical counterparts.                                                                                              The transfer of information in a multicomputer system is a major                bottleneck.  The realization and study of optical communication                 technologies is very important and has high payoff.  A careful analysis         of interconnect delays as a function of system hierarchy must be made           in order for this emerging technology to be successfully deployed in            real systems.                                                                   The principal investigator is a new Ph.D. who already has significant           progress in his research.  The research focuses on important and timely         topics.  Support is highly recommended.",
