 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project allows a fieldworker from the University of New                    Mexico and three graduate students and collaborating physicians                 to investigate  the interaction between behavior, health and                    reproduction in traditional societies.  Specifically the                        researchers will study health, subsistence, reproduction and                    parenting among a tribe of Indians in Manu National Park, Peru.                 The project will investigate the factors affecting the growth,                  health and survival of Indian children, with special interest on                parental strategies for guarding their children's health, and on                the effects of nutrition and work on women's fecundity.                                                                                                         This research is important because it will provide an                           understanding of demographic and health issues in a small-scale,                traditional community living in fairly primitive conditions.  Any               understanding of these issues in more industrialized urban                      conditions has to build upon a baseline of understanding from                   more primitive conditions.  This project will provide data of                   significant value toward this end.",
