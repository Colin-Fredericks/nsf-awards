 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is the long term objective of these studies to learn                    about the genomic structures required for the expression of                     particular proteins in particular neuronal and glial cells and                  the factors which regulate that expression.  The hypothesis                     generally accepted by molecular biologists that trans-acting                    factors act at specific sequences to stimulate transcriptional                  initiation.  The factors and the sequences at which they act are                known for only a few genes at present.  Many proteins of the                    central nervous system (CNS) are thought to be expressed in only                a subset of neurons.  Dr. Sutcliffe specific hypothesis will test               the particular sequences or sets of sequences determine which                   genes are actively transcribed in particular cells in response to               the set of trans-acting transcriptional stimulatory factors                     present in those cells.  The specific studies described in this                 proposal will involve characterization at the nucleotide sequence               level of the 5' ends of the mRNAs and the regions upstream from                 the transcriptional initiation sites on the genes for neuron-                   specific enolase and non-neuronal enolase.  These studies will                  define the promoter regions for these two genes so that                         appropriate transfection assays for their function can be                       designed.  Those assays will allow deletion and mutagenesis                     experiments to be performed which will indicate the particular                  nucleotides required for specifying brain cell-specific gene                    expression, and will provide information necessary for                          identifying the trans-acting factors which regulate transcription               of these two genes.  Both promoter and enhancer elements will be                investigated.  These studies should provide insights into the                   specific mechanisms which regulate transcription of these                       particular genes and also illuminate the features of general                    classes of gene regulatory sequences which determine                            developmental stage- and lineage-specific gene expression in the                brain.",
