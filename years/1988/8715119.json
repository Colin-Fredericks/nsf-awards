 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of ten U.S. mathematicians in             a multinational seminar coorganized by William Jones of the                     University of Colorado, Arne Magnus of Colorado State University and            Haakon Waadeland and Olav Njastad of the University of Trondheim                (Norway).  The purpose of the seminar is to bring together                      mathematicians from the U.S., Norway, and several other European                countries who share a common interest in Pade approximants but have             different mathematical backgrounds and viewpoints.  Invited                     participants include both senior and younger mathematicians with                research expertise in topics such as orthogonal polynomials, special            functions, moment theory, continued fractions, and other areas of               approximation theory.  The sharing of insight and understanding from            these related perspectives is expected to uncover new lines of                  research and lead to increased cooperation among the participants               from different countries.                                                                                                                                       Pade approximants and continued fractions are closely related to                many disciplines of pure and applied mathematics, including the                 theory of moments, orthogonal polynomials, Gaussian quadrature,                 representation of analytic functions, asymptotics and summability of            divergent series.  The development of high speed digital computers              has fostered their application to numerical analysis, special                   functions, theoretical physics and chemistry, and the theory of                 electrical networks and digital signal processing.  The interactions            of the diverse participants should provide new insights that will               have impact on several of these fields.",
