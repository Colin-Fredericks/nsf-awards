 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to investigate computer technology in           support of the representation and manipulation of mathematical                  knowledge.  The long-term goal is to produce a consistent and                   constructive representation of mathematics, driven by the needs of              significant applications.  Key issues to be examined include the use of         object-oriented multiple representations, the encoding of dependencies,         and techniques for incorporating ambitious data bases of formulas of            various types.  These applications might include                                                                                                                o    The development of modern interactive systems for general                       mathematics.                                                                                                                                               o    Integrated applications which involve access to large data-                     bases of  mathematical or physical knowledge, approximation                     techniques, and \"expert\" systems; areas of interest include                     computational fluid dynamics, robot planning, and computer-                     aided design of solids.                                                                                                                                    o    Publication of hypertext-like technical reference texts or                      educational material which would include not only mathematics                   as typeset material but mathematics as representations and                      executable algorithms.                                                                                                                                     o    Interactive manipulation of scientific software (program                        text, libraries) for program generation, (human)                                comprehension, improvement, and validation.",
