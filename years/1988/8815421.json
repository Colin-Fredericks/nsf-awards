 "awd_abstract_narration": "At the invitation of the government of the People's Republic               of China, the National Conference of Lawyers and Scientists                     (NCLS), a joint committee of the American Association for the                   Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the American Bar Association                  (ABA), will offer a short course in October 1988 to senior                      policymakers, scientists, and scholars in Beijing, Shanghai, and                Nanjing on the dynamic interactions of law, science, and                        technology.  The primary Chinese organizations responsible for                  the arrangements and for choosing the participants include the                  State Council, the State Science and Technology Commission, the                 National People's Congress, and the Chinese Academy of Social                   Sciences.                                                                            A multi-disciplinary short course of this nature will                      provide the Chinese government with an enhanced appreciation of                 the relevance of law to science and technology, this at a time                  when China's goal is to harness science and technology to                       economic development.  The furtherance of such an understanding                 will permit the leadership to apply complex conceptual concerns                 to making policy, formulating legislation, and training                         specialists.  As importantly, it will also acquaint the                         leadership with social science theory and research relating to                  law, science, and technology and some of the ethical issues                     involved in the interaction between science, technology, and law.",
