 "awd_abstract_narration": "This small liberal arts college for women with a strong tradition of            training women in the sciences is reintroducing a course in Inorganic           Chemistry and requiring it for the Chemistry major.  The course, as it          is being offered, is open to students of sophomore standing or higher.          The instruments necessary for an undergraduate course in Inorganic              Chemistry, a fast-scan UV/Vis Spectrophotometer, an Atomic Absorption           Spectrometer, and a Magnetic Susceptibility Balance, were chosen due to         the ease of obtaining and interpreting data, and the ability of these           instruments to examine both gross physical properties and molecular and         atomic properties.  The experiments being performed with these                  instruments reinforce or substantiate the concepts introduced in the            classroom, rather than simply giving the student \"experience\" doing a           particular manipulation or using the particular instrument.  For most           experiments the students are working independently in obtaining certain         data, but then, as a class, share and evaluate the data in discovering          and developing patterns.  By allowing sophomores to take this course            they are hoping to give more students the opportunity to pursue                 advanced studies in inorganic chemistry.                                                                                                                        The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.",
