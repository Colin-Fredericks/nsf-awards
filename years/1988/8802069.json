 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the development and verification of                     mathematical models for the solution of inverse problems associated             with phase change casting processes.  The methodology is based on               sequential and regularization methods in conjunction with an implicit           Finite Element Method (FEM) formulation and deforming FEM techniques.           A general analysis of inverse phase change problems including variable          material properties will be developed.  Casting processing involving            mushy regions and complex geometries will be considered.  This                  analytical research is closely tied to an industrial affiliate who is           performing the associated experiments.                                                                                                                          Solidification processes are of vital engineering significance.  There          is no existing methodology for the computational analysis of inverse            phase change problems.  This research considers the development of              inverse techniques for phase change problems, the control of                    solidification processes and the associated microstructure is                   possible.  This could lead to significant fundamental and practical             contributions of importance to our industrial institutions.",
