 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study examines a persistent anomaly in the research literature on          the household division of labor:  employed married women do the bulk of         the housework but few describe this arrangement as unfair.  Clearly             inequality in household labor is not necessarily a reflection of                inequity.  Equity theory proposes that perceptions of fairness are              based on definitions of situation, rather than just a comparison of             behavior between the individuals involved.  Families, like other                institutions, legitimate and perpetuate some -- but not all --                  inequalities.                                                                                                                                                   Using a probability sample of 600 employed married women and 400                husbands, this telephone survey explores the circumstances in which the         division of household labor is perceived as unjust, and examines the            psychological consequences of perceived inequity.  The broad                    significance of this study lies in its use of equity theory to draw a           connection between the balance of power in the household and in the             wider society -- testing critical propositions about distributive               justice.",
