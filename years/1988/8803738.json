 "awd_abstract_narration": "Osmotic flow through clays and shales can result in anomalous              hydrostatic pressures in the subsurface.  Within the past 15                    years, experiments conducted on clay membranes have shown that the              permselectivity of membrane-functioning materials like clay is                  sufficiently high to generate appreciable osmotically-induced                   hydrostatic pressure in the subsurface.  Yet to be resolved is                  whether osmotic-generated pressures are sustainable to explain                  long-term phenomena like artesian conditions and thrust faulting.                    Dissipation of osmotic pressure can be tested by measuring 3               phenomenological coefficients of the clay membrane.  Of these, the              solute permeability coefficient (w) is the most important in                    determining the rate at which an osmotic cell runs down.  To date,              there exists no data for (w) inn clay membrane systems having low               porosities akin to aquitard materials in deep sedimentary basins.                    This study proposes to measure the rates at which                          osmotically-generated hydrostatic pressures are dissipated across               bentonite membranes of various porosities.  These data, mainly in               the form of (w) values, will help resolve the kinetic conundrum of              geologic membrane systems.  If these data show that osmotic-                    pressure dissipation is extremely slow, then this should result in              a re-evaluation of mechanisms causing anomalous hydrostatic                     pressures in the subsurface -- particularly for deep sedimentary                basins.",
