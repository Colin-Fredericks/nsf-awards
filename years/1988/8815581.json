 "awd_abstract_narration": "Charles Boyer will continue his research into moduli                       problems which arise in mathematical physics. This is currently                 one of the most active areas of mathematics and has been shown to               have profound consequences in mathematical physics, topology and                geometry.                                                                            The motivation for much of Boyer's work is the realization                 that many moduli problems in mathematics and mathematical physics               are intimately related to the homotopy theory of iterated loop                  spaces. It is this observation that reveals the relationship                    between the topology of the moduli spaces and the differential                  topology of the underlying four dimensional manifold. Boyer's                   work is expected to shed further light on this relationship. It                 also holds promise of revealing deeper understanding of                         connections between algebraic topology and geometric non-linear                 partial differential equations.",
