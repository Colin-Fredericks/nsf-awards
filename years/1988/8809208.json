 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program is designed to add to our understanding of                the neurobiological basis of memory.  Dr. Jarrard is examining                  the types of memory deficit which occur when a very specific part               of the brain sustains damage.  While there is considerable                      evidence that this region of the brain, the hippocampus, is                     important in the formation of memories, the exact nature of this                involvement is not yet known.                                                                                                                                   The long history of the search for the memory trace, or \"engram,\"               is filled with attempts to attach functional relevance to many                  different parts of the brain.  Unfortunately, most of this                      previous work has been performed using mechanical or electrical                 lesions, that is, a rather imprecise part of the brain had been                 damaged.  Dr. Jarrard has developed a new technique which uses                  specific neurotoxins for selectively depleting nerve cells within               the hippocampus, but which spares nerve fibers.  The result of                  this procedure is that the overall damage to the hippocampus is                 markedly reduced.  As a consequence, functional specificity can                 be attributed to groups of nerve cells within this brain area.                  The knowledge gained from these experiments provides us with a                  better understanding of how the hippocampus is involved in                      learning and memory.                                                                                                                                            At the human level, the hippocampus is often found to be damaged                in patients with Alzheimer's Disease, those who have suffered                   from stroke, in some types of epilepsy, in perinatal asphyxia,                  and in postoperative complications resulting from cardiothoracic                surgery.  As a result of this hippocampal damage, there is a                    problem in learning and remembering new information.  The                       research being conducted by Dr. Jarrard is not only adding to                   what is known about how the brain controls learning and memory,                 but is also adding to our understanding of a part of the brain                  often associated with memory problems in humans.",
