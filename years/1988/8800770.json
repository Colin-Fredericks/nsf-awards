 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most                       powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                   the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                     substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                  molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                    molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                          spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out                      frontier research.                                                                                                                                              This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program                    will help the Department of Chemistry of Michigan State                         University to acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer and to                      upgrade an existing NMR spectrometer.  The areas of chemical                    research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include:                                                                                                      1) Structure and function of various natural tetrapyrrolic                         macromolecules                                                               2) Polycyclic aromatic compounds with multi-rotational barriers                 3) New cycloaddition photochemistry and photochemistry of                          rotationally constrained compounds                                           4) Chemistry of low-valent metal clusters with unconventional                      ligands                                                                      5) Photochemistry of binuclear (Ir, Rh) complexes with                             fluorophosphine ligands                                                      6) Lewis acid catalyzed organic rearrangements and cyclyzations.",
