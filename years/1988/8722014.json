 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposal is to provide an economic explanation for          the emergence of, and the effects, corporate culture.  In the context           of this research, corporate culture is defined as the common language           or code of conduct shared by employees of the firm, which are not               shared by those outside the firm.  Several approaches to analyzing              corporate culture will be undertaken, which attempt to translate in             economic terms the insights derived from other disciplines concerned            with organizational behavior.  One approach will focus on the cognitive         aspects of corporate culture, the knowledge of codes, facts, and rules          shared by the members of the organization.  Another approach will               emphasize the incentive aspects of corporate culture, which uses the            framework of overlapping games to model the stability of organizational         values while its members change.  Finally, these models are applied to          examining the costs and benefits of mergers, and to try and formalize           the notion that ownership instability can limit the investment of               employees in firm-specific knowledge and job skills.  This project is           important because it may provide a more fundememtal understanding               of the factors that determine the effectiveness of organizations.",
