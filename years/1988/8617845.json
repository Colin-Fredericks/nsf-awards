 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most important tasks for marine biologists                      interested in fish populations in the world's oceans is to                      understand how fish species become distributed, how fishes                      survive the exingencies of marine environments, and how the                     abundances of fish populations are regulated.  At the center of                 this problem is comprehensive knowledge of the most vulnerable                  stage in the life history of a fish:  its larval form.                               This project deals with the world's best documented and                    largest collection of larval fishes of the Atlantic Ocean,                      collected over two decades.  As such, this research collection                  represents a very valuable research resource, since numerous                    scientists from the U.S.A., Canada and Europe will depend on it                 for continuous reference.  Because the collection was made over                 such a long period of time, it will give scientists a unique                    opportunity to study fundamental changes in the nature of                       speciescomposition and abundance.  Such changes may be related to               various environmental factors and will enable fishery biologists                to anticipate changes in the abundance of commercially important                fishes.  Because fish larvae exhibit numerous features of                       interest to biologists studying the developmental patterns of                   various organ systems, the collection will play a key role in                   furnishing the necessary developmental stages of fish species                   which are not accessible without extensive and costly oceanic                   exploration.  Fish larvae form a significant component of the                   zooplankton and their distributional patterns reflect major                     oceancurrents and their dynamics.  The larval fish collection                   will indirectly aid oceanographers with a historical perspective                of the dynamics of zooplankton distributions.",
