 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of Dr. Walsh's work is to understand how                      synthesis of the more than 200 different proteins which make up                 the flagellar apparatus is regulated during the differentiation                 of Naegleria gruberi amebae into flagellates.  He has been                      investigating this question using four classes of cDNA clones                   specific to differentiating cells, the DS clones, which represent               proteins of the flagellar apparatus.  The current proposal                      attempts to answer the question: how is transcription of the DS                 genes regulated?  The approach involves a comparison of the DS                  genes and genes for mRNAs that are present in both amebae and                   flagellates (NS genes).  This analysis will begin with sequencing               recently isolated genomic clones for the four DS genes and 2 NS                 genes.  The functional significance of the resulting sequence                   information will then be evaluated using DNase hypersensitivity                 to define regions of the DS chromatin which change during changes               in their transcription, followed by a nucleotide level analysis                 of selected regions of the DS and NS genes using                                \"photofootprinting\".  Dr. Walsh also plans to develop a                         transfection system for Naegleria in order to test hypotheses                   about gene regulation developed from the structural analysis.                       The differentiation of the amebae of Naegleria gruberi into                 swimming flagellates is a dramatic example of the structural                    changes that can occur in organisms in response to environmental                stimulae.  As such it represents an excellent model system in                   which to study the regulation of differentiation.",
