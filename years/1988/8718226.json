 "awd_abstract_narration": "The tetrahymenine ciliates are a large widely distributed                       assembly of superficially similar eukaryotic protists.                          Studies on their ribosomal RNA sequences indicate that they                     had a common orgin at a very remote  time in their evolutionary                 history, and that the modern species constitute of several                      distinctive clusters.  Of the more than 30 species that have                    been named thus far, only one - Tetrahymena thermophila - has                   been subjected to systematic genetic analysis.  Most of our                     inferences concerning the genetic systems of ciliates are                       based on that one model.  Preliminary breeding studies have                     been carried out on a few other Tetrahymena species, using                      mating types, immobilization antigenes, and isozymic variants                   as genetic markers.  These studies show that substantial                        differences may exist in the behaviors of similar markers in                    different species.  The studies suggest that macronuclei may                    arise from micronuclei in different ways in different                           species, and that the genetic material of the macronuclei may                   be organized in substantially different ways.  We propose to                    expand the Tetrahymena breeding studies on some of the less                     well known species now under study and to extend preliminary                    genetic analysis to even more widely separated species if                       complementary mating types can be obtained.  We particularly                    hope to examine more fully the system of mating type                            determination in Tetrahymena malaccensis, and the systems for                   mating type and serotype inheritance in T. pigmentosa.  The                     species in which we will search particularly for                                complementary mating types are T. paravorax and T. caudata,                     and any species of the genera Colpidium or Glaucoma.                                                                                                            The separation of germ line and somatic genomes into two                        nuclei in the ciliates offers an opportunity to scientists                      to probe into a unique genetic system.  Tetrahymena                             thermophilia has been the most intensely studied ciliate in                     this respect and the little we know of the mechanisms                           involved with the breakdown of the micro- or germ line                          nucleus to form the macro- or somatic nucleus has resulted                      from studies of this organism.  The suggestion that other                       species may have different operating mechanisms is an                           exciting one and one that should be pursued.",
