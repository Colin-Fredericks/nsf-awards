 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ethylene is a plant growth regulator with potent effects                        throughout plant growth and development, from seed                              germination through fruit ripening and senescence and death                     of the plant.  Other plant hormones affect the key regulatory                   step leading to the synthesis of ethylene in plants.  Thus,                     the biosynthesis of ethylene presents a very complicated                        picture.  The enzyme which carries out the final biosynthetic                   step is present in extremely small amounts and has eluded                       expert plant biochemists for years.  This project funds a                       short term project to purify and identify this key plant                        enzyme.                                                                                                                                                         Both the phytohormones indole-3-acetic acid and                                 brassinosteroid specifically affect the conversion of S-                        adenosylmethionine (SAM) to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic                    acid (ACC), the key reaction controlling the production of                      ethylene.  Despite ethylene's role in diverse plant                             physiological processes, the major features of control of its                   formation from SAM via ACC within the plant and how it acts                     have not been established.  The study of ACC synthase (the                      rate limiting enzyme which catalyzes the reaction between SAM                   and ACC) and how phytohormones affect its level in tissues                      have been hampered by the inability to obtain purified enzyme                   and thus be able to detect specific changes in mRNA formation                   or stability which could account for the elevation in ACC                       synthase activity.  This study focuses on the further                           development of the present purification scheme for obtaining                    purified enzyme and also to characterize it.  The enzyme                        being purified is ACC synthase from etiolated mung bean                         hypocotyl tissue which has been hormonally treated to elevate                   enzyme levels.  Purification will involve chromatography on                     phenyl sepharose, hydroxylapatite and anion exchange columns.                   The purified enzyme will be characterized by denaturing gel                     electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing.  Kinetic properties                   and coenzyme content will also be analyzed.  Once this                          project is complete to study the regulation of ACC synthase                     can be attempted and how other plant hormones affect                            transcriptional control of this key enzyme can be learned.***//",
