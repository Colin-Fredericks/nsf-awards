 "awd_abstract_narration": "In spite of a general concensus that nutrients, disturbance                and competition are the most important factors controlling plant                community structure, there is considerable controversy over the                 relative importance and the modes of action of these factors.                   This controversy can only be resolved through experiments that                  simultaneously manipulate all these variables.  This has never                  been done.                                                                           The objectives of this work are 1) to examine the effects of               nutrients and disturbance on plant community structure in a full                factorial experiment that will allow both their interactive and                 independent effects to be examined; and 2) to investigate the                   role of both above and below ground competition in shaping                      community structure in a range of nutrient and disturbance                      regimes.  A factorial nutrient and disturbance experiment will be               constructed in a well-studied old field at Cedar Creek Natural                  History Area in Minnesota.  The limiting nutrient (nitrogen) and                the most important disturbance (gopher mounds) in this field will               be applied for five years to allow the communities to approach                  equilibrium under the experimental treatments.  The effects of                  treatments on soil, light and the plant community will be                       measured annually.  After the communities have had three years to               equilibrate, we will transplant four \"target\" species into the                  gradients and use removal experiments to test whether competitive               hierarchies and competition intensity vary with nutrients and                   disturbance.  The results of this experiment will allow explicit                tests of current, divergent hypotheses about the interactions of                nutrients, disturbance and competition in shaping community                     structure.",
