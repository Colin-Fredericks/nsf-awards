 "awd_abstract_narration": "Michigan Technological University will operate a series of workshops in         the area of geographic information systems (GIS).  The workshops are            critical to fill a need in keeping undergraduate faculty members abreast        of new ideas and techniques utilizing geographic information systems.           This will result in the updating of GIS courses.  Hence undergraduates          will have the appropriate knowledge and training for employment as a GIS        specialist.                                                                                                                                                     Two two-week workshops will be held at the School of Forestry and Wood          Products, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, Michigan.  The           workshops will provide the participants with an opportunity to meet,            receive state-of the art information, gain hands-on experience, exchange        ideas, and develop appropriate lectures and laboratory exercises for            undergraduate GIS courses.  In addition, attendees will meet with               several GIS managers to see how a GIS operates on a day-to-day basis,           and determine what employees deem important for undergraduate GIS               students to know.                                                                                                                                               Success of the project will be determined by a questionnaire assessing          both the quality of the workshop and the utility of the lecture and lab         manual developed as part of the workshop.                                                                                                                       In addition to the NSF funds, participants institutions will provide            about 15% in travel costs toward the operation of the project.",
