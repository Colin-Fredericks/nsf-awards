 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eukaryotic cells maintain distinct organellar and cytoplasmic                   systems of protein synthesis, and there appears to be very                      overlap between the gene familes that specify the components                    of the two systems.  The genes for components of the                            organellar translation systems are divided between two                          genetic systems.  For the mitochondrial translation system of                   Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the rRNAs, tRNAs and one ribosomal                    protein are specified by the mitochondrial genome, and over                     100 additional proteins are encoded by nuclear genes.                           Combined molecular biological and genetic approach is being                     taken to identify and characterize nuclear genes in yeast                       that encode components of the mitochondrial protein synthetic                   machinery.  These genes are being cloned by immunological                       screening of a yeast genomic library constructed in the gtll                    phage expression vector and by genetic complementation of                       temperature-sensitive mutants that are defective in                             mitochondrial protein synthesis.  The cloned genes, combined                    with specific immunological probes, provide the tools to                        systematically study the structure, function, and regulation                    of a unique set of translational components.  Studies thus                      far have been focussed on three genes, each of which appears                    to be subject to different modes of regulation.  Of                             particular interest are two genes that are regulated                            posttranscriptionally.  A major part of this proposal is                        devoted to the critical evaluation of the possibility that                      these genes are subject to unique forms of translational                        control.                                                                                                                                                        How different genomes in the same cell communicate is still a                   genetic mystery.  The results of this study should give                         greater insight into that process.",
