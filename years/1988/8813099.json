 "awd_abstract_narration": "The El Verde Field Station of the University of Puerto Rico                is a long-established research facility in the only Neotropical                 rain forest under the jurisdiction of the United States.  The                   field station is located in the Caribbean National Forest, which                is an Experimental Forest and a Biosphere Reserve.  The field                   station and the surrounding research area have been the focus of                projects by scientists from over 50 institutions in the United                  States and overseas.  Current research projects are funded by the               U.S. Department of Energy, the National Sceince Foundation, the                 National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the U.S.                     Forest Service.  Proposals to NSF for work at El Verde totalling                over $3 million are currently pending.                                               An increase in the number of researchers seeking                           accommodations at El Verde necessitates an expansion and                        renovation of the facilities of the field station.  This project                will provide partial support for construction and renovation of a               dormitory for visiting researchers, renovation of a collections                 room, upgrading of the electrical facilities, and installation of               air conditioning for the main laboratory building.//",
