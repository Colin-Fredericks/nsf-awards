 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Devonian Acadian orogeny was the result of collisional                 tectonics involving North America and continental material to the               east.  Acadian tectonic development involved early fold and                     thrusts nappes followed by complex back folding with structural                 and metamorphic fabrics accompanying stages.  The pattern of meta-              morphic isograds and reconstructed P-T trajectories bear a complex              relationship to the deformation stages. This combined structural                and petrologic study is aimed at developing a clearer and                       chronologically more precise tectonic and thermal history of the                belt.  Exposures of high metamorphic grade in central                           Massachusetts can be correlated with fossil-bearing units to the                north, thus allowing stratigraphic sequence to be a useful tool in              understanding the pattern of large-scale structural features and                the growth of metamorphic minerals will be used to establish the                relative ages of deformation and thermal events and to evaluate                 the sequence of pressure and temperature conditions to which                    different rocks were subjected.  Results will help develop a                    fuller understanding of mid-crustal processes during the develop-               ment of this major mountain belt.",
