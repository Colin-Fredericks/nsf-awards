 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our initial success in dating and locating a major                         earthquake, previously unknown, on the San Andreas fault was the                result of extensive sampling and analysis over several years.  The              end product is a calendar date giving an exact interval between                 that event and an event in the historical record in 1857.  The                  seismic implications are that strain release in the area may be                 episodic rather than periodic.  It is herein proposed to further                apply tree-ring dating to paleoseismology.  Tree-ring analysis is               virtually unique in being able to absolutely date site-disturbing               events like earthquakes.  It is the absolute dating of each and                 every annual ring prior to examination for disturbance that makes               this application determine if there was an earlier event just to                the northwest of our study area near Wrightwood, California; study              the extent of the 1838 event in the Bay area; precisely date an                 event on the Little Salmon fault at the southeast end of the                    Cascadia Subduction zone; and to investigate an area in southern                Italy where conditions seem very promising for locating                         undocumented ground ruptures in an active seismic region.  The                  knowledge gained from our previous studies, including the                       disappointments, has equipped us to operate efficiently and to                  target better zones for analysis.  Another step to optimize                     results is the inclusion of seismologists familiar with or working              in the proposed study areas.  The background information furnished              by them aids in defining specific questions and in interpreting                 the seismic significance of any results.",
