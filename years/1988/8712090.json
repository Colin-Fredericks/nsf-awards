 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the travel costs for 9 invited American                 scientists to attend a joint seminar on environmental cognition and             assessment with scientists from Italy, Sweden, The Netherlands, and             the United Kingdom.  The seminar, organized by Dr. Gary W. Evans,               University of California, Irvine, and Dr. Tommy Garling, University             of Umea, Sweden, will be held in Umea from June 29 to July 2, 1988.             The purpose of the seminar is to advance understanding of how humans            comprehend and evaluate their physical environments.  Three major               topic areas of the seminar will be:  (1) how aspects of the physical            environment affect and interact with impressions, beliefs, and                  decisions about the environment, (2) how various models of                      psychological processes fit perception and cognition of                         environments, and (3) how people change their perceptions and                   cognitions of the environment in response to experience and aging.              The seminar will also examine how people's goals and objectives for             an environment affect their judgments about it.                                                                                                                 The seminar will provide a useful forum for interchanging ideas and             will most likely lead to additional collaborative research between              the American and foreign scientists.  The participants are                      outstanding researchers who were chosen because they represent                  diverse areas in environmental psychology that use different models             and approaches.  Besides resolving scientific issues, the seminar               will lead to knowledge with relevance to policy-making, planning,               and design of human environments.  The organizers plan to publish a             book based on the seminar papers.",
