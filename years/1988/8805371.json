 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continuing his geological research in the Turkana Basin region of               Northern Kenya, Dr. Brown and his colleagues will conduct a                     detailed study of specific subareas to determine local                          paleoenvironmental conditions.  Some represent sites where                      hominid (human) fossil specimens are exceptionally well preserved               while others are potential sources of hominid materials.                        Archaeological sites of great antiquity will also be examined and               set in chronological order.  Dr. Brown will provide detailed                    description of local sections, analyze sediments, and document                  lateral variation in lithologies.  The goal of the research is                  not only to date important localities but also to determine local               paleoenvironmental conditions and reconstruct landscapes at                     critical periods of time.  In this process, Dr. Brown will also                 search for additional sites with archaeological and                             paleontological remains.                                                                                                                                        The East African Rift Valley in which Dr. Brown will work is the                prime source of evidence which relates to the development of                    humanity over the last four million years.  Some individual sites               have been well studied but others have not, and Dr. Brown is the                first to attempt a chronological and climatic synthesis.  This                  research contributes to that goal.                                                                                                                              To understand the history of human development is important, not                only to date milestones along the road but also to reconstruct                  the shifting environment in which humans emerged, since it is                   clear that species respond to and are shaped by such fluxuations                in their environment.  This research will help to accomplish                    these goals.",
