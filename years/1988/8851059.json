 "awd_abstract_narration": "In partnership with industrial firms, The Impression 5 Science Museum           will organize and operate a program  to encourage disadvantaged minority        children and their families to develop an interest in and knowledge of          science.  This will involve a variety of activities -- science clubs,           field trips, exhibitions -- designed to reach children and parents in           settings familiar to them.  Mini-museums will be set up in appropriate          community centers.  A bus modified to look like a space shuttle will be         used to bring science activities to fairs, neighborhood settings, and           other locations, and to transport children to other points of interest,         including the main museum.  The program will be carried out in close            cooperation with the schools, but outside of school hours.  Because the         Lansing schools already bring all fourth graders to the museum,                 inservice programs for those teachers will be arranged by the museum            utilizing industry and university scientists.  Industrial support will          be both financial and through its people -- as participants in planning         and presenting science activities for children and teachers and as role         models.  Cost sharing by industry and the museum will equal 63% of the          NSF funding.",
