 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neurons are dependent upon their highly unusual shape for                       function.  The axon is an exceptionally long \"electric wire\"                    extension of the neuron and conducts the electrical signals                     generated in the nervous system.  In developing, embryonic                      vertebrates, a substantial portion of the elongation of axons                   occurs as a result of tension applied to the axon by the                        expansion of the growing embryo.  Previous studies on cultured                  neurons suggest that tension, exerted by the motile growth cone,                is responsible for axonal elongation.  The filamentous proteins                 of the cytoplasm (actin), microtubules, and intermediate                        filaments compose a dynamic skeletal structure for cells, i.e. a                cytoskeleton, that underlies the ability of axons to elongate.                  Mechanical tension is expected to regulate the cytoskeleton                     during axonal elongation.  This idea is supported by                            thermodynamic considerations that suggest the assembly of                       filaments is affected by mechanical forces.  This research                      project proposes to investigate the affect of mechanical tension                on the elongation and cytoskeleton of cultured, embryonic chick                 neurons.  The experiments will provide direct measurements of the               tension within axons through the use of force-calibrated glass                  needles.  The role of the cytoskeleton in producing or                          stabilizing the mechanical force will be determined through the                 used of anti-cytoskeletal drugs known to halt axonal elongation.                The mechanical forces involved in experimentally induced                        elongation of axons will be achieved by towing the axons with an                appropriately paced motor.  This growth is a model for the                      elongation of axons within the expanding displacements of force-                calibrated glass needles.  Anti-cytoskeletal drugs will be used                 to assess the contribution of various cytoskeletal components.                  This work is most clearly relevant to obtaining a better                        understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of the                        development of the nervous system.  The study has a broad                       scientific relevance because axonal elongation is a special case                of the general function of the cytoskeleton to elaborate and                    maintain cell shape in eukaryotes.  A better understanding of the               relationship of cell shape, mechanical force and the cytoskeleton               is particularly interesting because of recent evidence that cell                shape plays a fundamental role in regulation of cell division, in               the responsiveness of cells to signal molecules such as hormones                and growth factors, and the loss of normal regulation in disease                states.",
