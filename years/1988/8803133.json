 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports a study of magnetospheric storms.                      Specifically, it covers: (1) the asymmetric development of the                  main phase of magnetic storms, (2) the growth and decay of the                  substorm current system on the basis of DE satellite data and                   ground-based magnetic data and (3) modelling of interplanetary                  disturbance events.  During the initial phase of the project, the               following subjects have been chosen; (a) the asymmetric                         development of the main phase, (b) the growth and decay of the                  substorm current system, (c) subtraction of the geomagnetic                     disturbance fields produced by the polar current system, (d)                    energetic neutral atoms and the asymmetry of the main phase, (e)                the input-output relationship, (f) modelling of interplanetary                  disturbance events and the associated storms and (g) the polar                  cap phenomena.                                                                       The project is designed to fulfill two additional purposes:                (1) training magnetospheric physicists who can well understand                  ground-based data and (2) promote solar-terrestrial physics                     (rather than solar and terrestrial physics) by considering                      magnetospheric disturbances as an integral part of solar-                       terrestrial physics.",
