 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Perry at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, has                     initiated an observational program which has as its primary goal                a high resolution, three dimensional survey of the dust component               of the interstellar medium in the neighborhood of the Sun.  The                 results will complete the coverage of the spatial distribution of               the interstellar reddening in the solar neighborhood, as similar                data for stars in the Northern Hemisphere have already been                     analyzed.                                                                                                                                                       Although cosmic dust may comprise only one percent of the                       interstellar medium, its presence has a pronounced effect on                    astronomical observations because it is a wavelength dependent                  absorber of radiation from stars.  It is essential, therefore, in               many astronomical studies to correct for this reddening effect                  for any direction in space and at various distances from the Sun.               Dr. Perry's aim is to provide reliable information on which                     astronomers can make a reddening correction.",
