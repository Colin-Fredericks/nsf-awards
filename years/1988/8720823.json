The               overall objective of the research is a detailed record of the                   physical sedimentology and micropaleontology of the Yakataga                    Formation, Gulf of Alaska which can provide a high-resolution                   record of late Cenozoic glacial and climatic history for the                    northern hemisphere.  In addition it provides the opportunity to                improve facies models of glacially influence continental margin                 sedimentation.  This award is to support the paleonenvironmental                analysis of the Yakataga Formation as based on the analysis of                  foraminiferal biofacies.  The proposed research will analyze                    samples from detailed measured and logged sections in the Gulf of               Alaska Tertiary Province.  This analysis will provide insights                  into climate history, paleobathymetry, chronostratigraphy and                   water mass structure of the Gulf of Alaska during the deposition                of the glaciomarine Yakataga Formation.  This paleoenvironmental                information will be combined with detailed lithofacies analyses to              produce a high-resolution record (on the order of 10 Ka) of late                Miocene to Holocene glacial history for the Gulf of Alaska.  This               record can then be compared with detailed studies of coeval                     sections in the North Atlantic/Canadian Arctic to document the                  differential histories of these two areas during the late                       Cenozoic.  The identified research is particularly timely given                 the proposed ODP drilling in the north Pacific during ca. 1990.",
