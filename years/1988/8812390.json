 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program                  provides support for the research of Dr. Robert Pascal, Jr.,                    Princeton University. The work is focused on the structures of                  molecules in which two relatively unreactive molecular entities                 are forced to be very close together. Groups of atoms which are                 forced in this way to occupy a limited space have unusual                       behavior, both in terms of their chemical reactivity and their                  physical properties.                                                                                                                                            In one class of target molecules, methine, amine, and ammonium                  groups will be pressed near the periphery of the pi electron                    clouds of aromatic rings; in a second class these same groups                   will be projected toward the center of the rings.  In the first                 case, the substituents on the \"target\" phenyl groups will be                    varied to produce aromatic rings which are relatively                           electron-rich or electron-deficient.  The extent of interaction                 of the functional groups with the ring should vary with this                    electronic substitution.  In the second class of compounds,                     increased interactions will be achieved not by the variation of                 aromatic ring substituents, but by synthesizing a series of                     compounds in which the distance between the functional group                    and ring is systematically reduced.  By balancing the forces                    due to intramolecular strain in these compounds with the degree                 of nucleophilicity or electrophilicity of the ring, structures                  may be observed with partial bonding between these groups. Such                 structures should be interpretable as analogs of transition                     states (which are not themselves observable) in the                             nucleophilic and electrophilic substitution reactions of                        aromatic compounds.",
