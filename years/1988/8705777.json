 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns the development and application of                       ultra-small voltammetric electrodes for intracellular                           determination of easily oxidized neurotransmitters.  One goal of                this research is to construct voltammetric electrodes smaller                   than those presently used (1-2 um tip diameters).  Electrodes                   with tip diameters less than 100 nm should be possible to                       fabricate and can be used for impaling very small neurons.                      Electrodes fabricated by hydrocarbon pyrolysis inside quartz                    microcapillaries will be used for voltammetry inside the cell                   body of the Giant dopamine neuron of Planorbis corneus                          (pond snail).  The rate of transport into the cell, metabolism                  and vesicularization of dopamine will be evaluated on the level                 of a single cell.  In addition, a novel tool for study of                       pharmacological effects on total dopamine stores will be                        developed and the possibility of dopamine uptake into                           post-synaptic cell bodies will be investigated.  Primary cultures               of rat substantia nigra, locus coeruleus, hypothalamus and                      striatum will be carried out.  Dissociated neurons in culture                   will serve as a model system to investigate the function of                     neurotransmitter in the cell body.  In addition, the combination                of ultra-small voltammetric electrodes and visible neuronal                     processes will permit placement of a sensor near a bundle of                    terminal fibers with local stimulation of a single axon.  Hence,                release of neurotransmitter might be observed from a single                     neuron.  Although most of the experiments planned concern                       dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin will also be examined with               respect to their roles in influencing dopamine neurochemistry.                  Since the functions of neurotransmitters in neuronal cell bodies                have not been heavily investigated, the experiments here                        represent a novel approach to the study of this dimension of                    neuronal communication.",
