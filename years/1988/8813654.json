 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over forty years of intermittent observations have                         established that the aurora emits radio noise which can be                      observed on the ground.  Surprisingly, despite the intensity with               which the aurora is studied, very little is known about these                   radio emissions, their frequency-time characteristics, their                    occurrence statistics, or their generation mechanisms.  This                    grant will support an investigation into the spectrum of radio                  emissions from the aurora in the frequency range 0.2-20 MHz using               an inexpensive ground-based \"smart\" system, consisting of a radio               receiver and data storage device controlled by a small computer.                This will be located near Fairbanks, Alaska at the site of                      previous measurements of auroral radio emissions, thus saving                   time and expense of finding a low-noise location.  Other                        instruments are located nearby to support the measurements, and                 the Geophysical Institute in Fairbanks will provide on-site                     assistance.  The scientific motivation for this grant may be                    summarized as follows: 1)  To better characterize the earth's                   radio environment; 2)  To study space plasma physics processes                  from the ground by observing the radio signatures of those                      processes; and 3)  To explore possibilities of using radio                      emissions as an index of auroral activity.  Although radio                      emissions comprise a small fraction of the total energy of the                  aurora, they may provide important clues to the more energetic                  processes, in analogy to the way in which solar radio emissions                 have been used to infer the processes taking place in the solar                 corona.",
