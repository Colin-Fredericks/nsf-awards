 "awd_abstract_narration": "An understanding of hydrostatic pressure as an ecological and                   evolutionary factor in the seas is being sought through the study of            deep-sea barophilic bacteria.  Pressure adapted bacteria have been              found in cold deep oceans and in warmer deep seas such as the                   Mediterranean, Sulu and Celebes Seas.  Laboratory studies on                    bacteria from various habitat depths implicate pressure as a far                greater influence in the ecology and evolution of deep-sea life than            has been recognized.  Furthermore, deep-sea bacteria may be integral            parts of the food web since they make polyunsaturated fatty acids               that are required dietary lipids for animals.  The objectives of                proposed laboratory work are:  to determine the role of deep-sea                bacterial polyunsaturated fatty acids in the deep-sea food web; to              evaluate the extent of the genetic and biochemical basis for                    barophily; and to determine if the barophilic response is invariant             with respect to the type of energy yielding reaction used by an                 organism.",
