 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transformation and distribution of water substance                     in natural clouds play a crucial role in both the                               atmosphere's heat budget and its capacity for motion.  The                      transformations between vapor liquid and ice account for                        about 20% of the heat budget in the mid-troposphere (15,000 -                    20,000 feet), while the distribution of water and ice                          essentially defines a crucial ingredient of the radiation                       field.  Further, melting and evaporation of cloud particles                     can produce hazardous downward motions such as downbursts.                           The objective of this work is the experimental                             examination of melting and evaporation of ice particles under                   various atmospheric conditions as simulated in a dynamical                      diffusion chamber; particle breakup, scavenging and                             electrification will be examined.  The results will be                          compared with cognate measurements obtained in recent field                     experiments.                                                                         Dr. John Hallett is well qualified to pursue this work;                    he is readily acknowledged by his peers to be one of the best                   cloud physicists.",
