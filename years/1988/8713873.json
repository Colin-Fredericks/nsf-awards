 "awd_abstract_narration": "An automated X-ray powder diffraction system that will enable                   investigators at the University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR) to pursue               research in the areas of materials science and X-ray powder                     diffraction techniques will be purchased.  The proposed equipment               would allow for obtaining diffraction data from specimens under a               wide range of environmental conditions and the reduction of these               data with a variety of computational algorithms.  The X-ray                     diffraction community would also benefit from UMR obtaining this                equipment as investigators at UMR are involved in the development               of line profile analysis algorithms, enhancement and support of a               community-developed Rietveld structure refinement code, and the                 development of quantitative analysis techniques for multi-                      component mixtures that do not require the preparation of                       standards.  The new system will also replace obsolete and worn                  out equipment.                                                                                                                                                  One of the principal investigators (James) is an experienced and                highly regarded scientist who had made several important                        contributions with regard to the structure of amorphous magnetic                materials.  His colleague, (Howard) is well regarded also.",
