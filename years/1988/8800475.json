 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall purpose of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)           is to develop an efficient electrochemical process for the commercial           production of amino acids.  Emphasis of the Phase I program was                 directed towards determining the technical feasibility of two                   electrochemical amination reactions to produce dl-dopa (used in the             preparation of the artificial sweetener Nutrasweet) and                         dl-phenylalanine (used in the treatment of Parkinson's Disease in the           elderly).  Work performed demonstrated the viability of this amino              acid synthesis route to produce dl racemic mixtures.  This Phase II             effort will be directed towards the synthesis of optically active               amino acids using polymer derivatized electrodes.  Two additional               commercially important amino acids will be synthesized, l-alanine and           l-valine.  Specific technical emphasis during Phase II will include:                                                                                            o  Incorporating the Ti3+/Ti4+ redox couple into polymer derivatized               electrodes to achieve high Faradaic efficiencies for aminyl radical             formation.                                                                   o  Providing optically active sites on the polymer derivatized                     electrode for inducing optical activity in the precursor molecule               subject to amination in close proximity to the                                  electrode/electrolyte interfacial region.                                    o  Preparing and electrochemically testing prototype electrolytic                  cells using electrode components and experimental conditions                    optimized during Phase II.                                                                                                                                   The application of electroorganic synthesis technology for the                  preparation of specialty chemicals can have advantages over                     conventional chemical synthesis routes including: providing greater             selectivity than an equivalent chemical process, being environmentally          more benign, and providing the opportunity for a simplified overall             industrial process where one or more steps normally found in                    conventional chemical processes can be avoided.  The research will              also increase understanding of electrochemical reaction mechanisms and          electrolytic cells.",
