 "awd_abstract_narration": "Radio emission generated by human activity can be classified as                 intentional and unintentional.  The former category includes                    transmitters, radars, and numerous other devices and is the                     subject of an extensive body of regulations.  Many other devices,               such as digital computers, electric switches, and radio and                     television receivers, generate radio emissions as a byproduct of                their activity.  Still other devices, such as cordless                          telephones, garage door openers, or home alarm systems, do emit                 intentionally but presumably at fairly low levels.  Both of these               categories of devices are only minimally regulated.  Such low                   level radio emissions constitute a major source of interference                 for radio astronomers and other scientists, who are passive users               of the spectrum, in detecting and studying natural radio                        emissions.  The aggregate effect of unintentional radio emitters                is to raise the natural noise floor level.  This effect                         interferes not only with passive users of the spectrum but also                 with a number of other scientific activities which make use of                  low level radio signals, such as wildlife tracking.  That the                   noise floor has already been raised considerably near major                     population centers has important implications.  Airline pilots,                 for example, find it increasingly difficult to listen to                        instructions as they near major population centers.                                                                                                             Knowledge of the noise level due to unintentional radiators is                  important for a number of reasons, such as the planning of                      interference prevention strategies, prediction of future trends,                and documentation of the invasion of such devices into the                      passive bands allocated to radio astronomy.  Measurements are                   difficult to carry out, however, and are practically                            nonexistent, except for a few frequency bands of interest to                    special groups.  The Principal Investigator (PI) will obtain such               measurements from aircraft, at frequencies allocated to radio                   astronomy, within the 30-3,000 MHz range, approximately.  The PI                obtained and published a similar, but less sophisticated, set of                measurements in 1972.  No other measurements exist to indicate                  the time evolution of this important activity.                                                                                                                  The research is of the kind that is fundamental to preserve a                   sound scientific environment.  The PI is very experienced and has               a proven track record.  An additional strong point is that most                 work will be carried out by a graduate student.  Few researchers                are working in this important area and the addition of trained                  manpower is highly desirable.//",
