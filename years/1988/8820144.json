 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will permit the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to manage         U.S. dues for the membership of the Committee on Data for Science and           Technology (CODATA) in the International Council of Scientific Unions           (ICSU) for the 12-month period beginning January 1, 1988.  The National         Science Foundation (NSF) also provides funding to the NAS for the U.S.          Advisory Committee for ICSU and the U.S. National Committees for 20             constituent unions.  The Division of International Programs coordinates         NSF's activities in fostering international scientific cooperation,             including providing broad access by U.S. scientists and engineers to            the benefits of selected nongovernmental international organizations.           ICSU, with its worldwide representation of scientific fields, is among          the more important of these for U.S. scientists and engineers.                  CODATA is an interdisciplinary scientific committee of ICSU that seeks          to improve the quality, reliability, management, and accessibility of           data of importance to all fields of science and technology.  Because            all major industrialized nations are members of CODATA, and all major           scientific unions are represented, CODATA provides a unique forum for           U.S. scientists and engineers to advance their international interests          in a wide range of disciplines and to help solve associated data                problems.  In consideration of the merit of CODATA as a way of                  providing opportunities for cooperation in a multinational and                  multidisciplinary context, and of the highly satisfactory management of         U.S. participation in ICSU overall through the NAS, the program manager         recommends an award.",
