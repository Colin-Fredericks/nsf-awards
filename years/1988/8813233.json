 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This award supports cooperative research by                       Dr. Douglas Macdougall of Scripps Institute of Oceanagraphy                     with Dr. K. Gopalan of the National Geophysical Research                        Institute, in Hyderabad, India.  The work covers geo-                           chemical and petrogenetic research in the Deccan basalts of                     India.  The field research is to be carried in three areas,                     in Gujarat in western India, in the Rajasthan and in                            eastern India.  Each of these areas contains a different                        geologic structure and possesses a unique relevance to the                      general field of mantle geochemistry.  Samples will be                          collected and shipped to the U.S. where laboratory work                         will be done at Scripps.                                                                                                                                        Scope:  Drs. Macdougall and Gopalan have collaborated in                        this research area for several years with significant                           published results and with a number of U.S. graduate                            students obtaining samples and data, for their Ph.D.                            research, from the field in India.  The collaborative                           effort is productive and the results of high quality.                           Dr. Macdougall is currently funded under two                                    grants:  INT8613485 for field expenses in India;                                and EAR8618554 for research costs in the U.S.                                   This action is being funded under INT8722661 to National                        Geophysical Research Institute and INT8813233 to Scripps                        Institute.",
