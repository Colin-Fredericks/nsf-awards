 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the problem of software compensation               of quasistatic machine-tool errors.  These errors are estimated                 to account for about 70% of the total errors of a machine-tool.                 A method to compensate such errors, therefore, has the potential                for bringing about tremendous improvements in the machine's                     accuracy.  Software error compensation approaches are very                      economical but not very effective because of a lack of proper                   models for understanding the error generation and propagation                   process.  A goal of this research is to develop a framework for                 mathematically modeling quasistatic errors.  In the actual                      application of such models in compensation schemes, the model's                 parameters have to be regularly updated (to account for the slow                variations).  Preliminary results have indicated that it is                     possible with a few measurements in the machines workspace.  This               forms the basis of a practical and cost-effective method of                     estimating and compensating quasistatic errors to improve the                   accuracy of machine-tools.  Studies to generalize this approach                 will also be included in this project.",
