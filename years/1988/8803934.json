 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project addresses the cause of the spatial distribution           of strong ground motion resulting from the Whittier Narrows earthquake          of October 1, 1987.                                                                                                                                             The pattern of damage caused by this earthquake is unusual.  The area           of most severe damage is at a distance of eight to nine kilometers              from the epicenter.  It occurred as a \"semi-ring of damage\" since               little or no severe damage was observed to the east of the epicenter.           Specifically, this project is examining an hypothesis that the very             localized damage pattern observed may be due to the effect of the free          surface on horizontally polarized shear waves (SV) incident at the              critical angle.  Preliminary investigation of this hypothesis is                strongly suggestive that is can explain the observed damage pattern.                                                                                            This information has the potential to contribute to the understanding           and prediction of earthquake damage, in particular the damage to                constructed facilities.",
