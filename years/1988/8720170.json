 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research seeks to examine the effects of family size (number               of siblings) on the social and psychological adjustment of                      adults.  The objectives are to look at the consequences of family               size for a range of variables, such as individual well-being,                   leisure time, achievement motivation.  Previous studies of the                  number of siblings have tended to focus exclusively on its impact               on cognitive functioning and educational achievement.  Thus this                study constitutes a logical extension of that work.  The study                  will use data from a 1976 archive, consisting of a national                     random sample of over 2000 adults.  The project will contribute                 to an understanding of the ways in which number of siblings                     affects adult personality and adjustment, an important issue                    given the current declines in family size.",
