 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on unique soft x-ray wave-length dispersive instrumentation            is proposed to fulfill important process monitor needs in the                   semiconductor industry.  ARACOR experience in designing and                     successfully applying multilayer synthetic microstructures to obtain            both wave-length discrimination and focusing of soft x-rays is                  utilized as a key parat of this work.                                                                                                                           This proposal details how the novel x-ray optic elements provide large          solid-angle collection efficiency and focusing of fluorescent soft x-           rays to yield quantitative, non-destructive measurement of elemental            materials within measurement times of one to two seconds instead of             minutes as for x-ray energy-dispersive instruments.  The rapidity of            measurement allows application as a process line monitor with the               capability of unambiguously determining the elemental concentrations            across the wafer surface. A unique and extremely significant                    application which comes directly from high flux counting is the                 ability to determine the projected range of ion implanted species.                                                                                              The proposed research in Phase I is primarily theoretical, with major           emphasis on determining the parameters characterizing the multilayer            synthetic microstructures.  The final result to be obtained in Phase I          is the design of a characterized prototype instrument.",
