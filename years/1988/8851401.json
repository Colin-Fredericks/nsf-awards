 "awd_abstract_narration": "While students in this department were receiving a modern view of          physiology in their classrooms, their physiology laboratory                     experiences before the advent of this project in many instances were            quite inadequate.  Many of introductory and intermediate-level                  laboratories or projects were of a descriptive rather than an                   analytical nature.  Other physiology-related laboratories or projects           employed somewhat primitive equipment.  A modern study of physiology            even at the undergraduate level requires considerably more                      sophisticated equipment and methodologies than were available to this           department.                                                                                                                                                          The objectives of this project are to enhance the quality of the           laboratory in several physiology-related courses by moving the                  laboratory experience from the descriptive to the analytical.  With             the new equipment and the new or modified procedures recently                   introduced, students are able to make accurate collections of complex           and meaningful data and to analyze it in the manner of the modern               physiologist.  Equipment includes a number of different transducers,            and two multipurpose minicomputers complete with the hardware and               software needed to interface with this equipment in a number of                 different configurations to study elements of both plant and animal             physiology.                                                                                                                                                          The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
