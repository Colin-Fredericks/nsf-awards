 "awd_abstract_narration": "Students of political science have long been interested in                      evaluating the dynamics of legislative behavior.  A primary data                source for these investigations has been the roll call votes of                 legislators in the U.S. Congress.                                                                                                                               This project involves the preparation of cleaned versions of the                Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research's                 (ICPSR, University of Michigan) roll call data files for both                   Houses of Congress from 1789 to 1985.  In a prior research                      project the investigators discovered numerous errors in the                     coding of legislators' party codes, state codes, identification                 numbers, etc.  Further evaluation of these data indicates that                  the data set is replete with additional data errors.  The                       investigators will prepare a version of the tapes for public use                in which the errors have been corrected.  In addition, the tapes                will be reformatted in a form that makes the data more accessible               to use on personal computers.                                                                                                                                   The ICPSR tapes are ordered by roll call.  Frequently, however,                 scholars are interested in identifying the voting record for a                  given individual.  The investigators will use the supercomputers                at the Princeton Supercomputer Center to transpose the entire                   data set (consisting of some 15,000,000 vote choices).  The                     researchers will produce data tapes on which the vote choices are               arranged by individual legislator.                                                                                                                              These cleaned data tapes will be made available to the ICPSR for                use by scholars interested in legislative behavior.",
