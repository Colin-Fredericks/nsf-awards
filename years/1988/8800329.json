 "awd_abstract_narration": "This effort will establish a time - series hydrographic station                 in the central North Pacific Ocean approximately 100km north of                 the island of Oahu as part of the Global Ocean Flux Study                       (GOFS) program.  This deep water oceanographic station will                     comprise a Pacific Ocean analogue to Station S (Panulirus                       Station) located in the North Atlantic Ocean near Bermuda.                      Monthly visits will be made to this station over an initial                     five-year period to begin a comprehensive study of the                          distribution, production and flux of biogenic particulate                       material in the obligotrophic ocean.  The scientific objectives                 are:  (1) to observe and interpret the seasonal and interannual                 variability in the biology and chemistry of the mixed layer and                 the euphotic zone, (2) to observe and interpret the seasonal                    and interannual variability  in the rates of particle flux and                  apparent rates of particle remineralization over the entire                     water column and (3) to understand the interrelationships                       between the processes mentioned in (1) and (2) above and the                    physical characteristics of the water column.  Water column                     physical characteristics will be analyzed as part of the World                  Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) during joint GOFS-WOCE                      cruises.  The collective data obtained at the Hawaii time                       series station will also be used to support GOFS level-2 and                    level-3 studies on biogeochemical fluxes and ocean circulation                  and will contribute to the Hawaiian Ocean Experiment (HOE), a                   co-ordinated interdisciplinary study of the Hawaiian Exclusive                  Economic Zone (EEZ).",
