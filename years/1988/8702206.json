 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Hazelwood discovered a putative \"new\" hormone in the                        pancreas of chickens and other vertebrates and tentatively named                it APP (for avian pancreatic polypeptide).  This polypeptide                    subsequently has been localized in the pancreata of all                         vertebrates studied, including man, as well as in the nervous                   system in those organisms which do not possess a pancreas                       (insects, etc.).  Original studies indicated a profound effect                  on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.  Within the last 10 years a               growing awareness has developed that a family of structurally                   similar PPs reside in different parts of the body.  Thus PP is                  restricted to the pancreas, PYY is largely restricted to the                    large intestine and colon, and NPY appears to be abundantly                     distributed in the brain and peripheral nervous system.  Recent                 findings have indicated a powerful effect of APP on certain                     functions of the stomach, pancreas and intestinal structures.                   Despite these positive findings the molecular basis of PP action,               the common denominator interrelating all of these diverse actions               of the polypeptide with each other, has not been determined.                    Recently Hazelwood has found that APP binds (interacts) with cell               membranes prepared from chicken brain more avidly than with                     membranes prepared from any other tissue.  Such findings indicate               that the brain may be a \"target site\" for APP action.  Before                   progressing to the complexities of APP and functional brain                     processes, it is desirable- if not essential- to characterize                   these binding sites and to learn as much as possible about                      factors which alter these sites in number as well as ability to                 bind circulating APP particularly in relation to other tissues                  where a APP and PP have been shown to have specific actions.                    Studies will be undertaken to characterize the chemical                         requirements for binding APP to brain and liver membranes.                      Attempts to manipulate these sites physiologically also will be                 carried out.  Finally, Hazelwood plans to establish the                         specificity of the binding of PP-like molecules to these sites by               comparing the NPY, PYY and APP binding affinities.  It is                       expected that a critical and meaningful understanding of the                    fundamental action and significance of PP in vertebrates will                   result.",
