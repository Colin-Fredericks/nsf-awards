 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate and contrast the likely responses                 of boreal evergreen forests, temperate deciduous forests, and                   temperate grasslands to changes in the global environmental over                1-50 years.  The environmental changes of interest include                      changes in the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere, changes in                  global surface temperature, changes in atmospheric N deposition,                and possibly changes in moisture and cloudiness.                                                                                                                \"Process-functional\" approach will be utilized this research, as                opposed to a \"population-community\" approach.  The focus is on                  ecosystem-level processes and functions such as gross and net                   primary productivity, net ecosystem productivity, decomposition,                and net mineralization.  Specifically, it is proposed to                        investigate and contrast: 1) how the initial amounts and                        distributions of C, N, and P in these three different ecosystem                 types affect the ecosystem-level responses to environmental                     change, and 2) how the amounts, distributions, and flux rates of                C, N, and P change in response to changes in the environment.                   The analytical procedures developed here should be applicable to                other major terrestrial ecosystem types, as well.  The proposed                 research is important because it will help 1) to anticipate the                 relative impacts of global change on various regions of the                     earth, 2) to interpret changes in individual ecosystems as they                 arise, and 3) to better understand the function of the individual               ecosystems.                                                                                                                                                     The goal of comparing ecosystem types requires that the \"process-               functional\" aspects of different ecosystems be analyzed from a                  common perspective and with identical units.  To do this a                      computer model will be developed that incorporates the important                components, processes, and linkages present in all terrestrial                  ecosystems.  By parameterizing this model for contrasting                       ecosystems, differences detected between ecosystems can be more                 clearly attributed to the ecosystems themselves and not to                      differences in the models used to describe them.                                                                                                                The research team for this project is excellent and brings a long               history of productive collaboration to bear upon the work.                      Institutional accommodations and facilities are excellent.",
