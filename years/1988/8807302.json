 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Plant Biology to               support Dr. Dewey's research and training under the mentorship of Dr.           Daniel Klessig.  The proposal outlines experiments designed to define           the targetting signals necessary for extracellular protein transport,           and intracellular compartmentalization into the central vacuole, in             higher plants.  To determine the factors required for extracellular             protein secretion, a pathogenesis-related protein of the PR1 family from        tobacco will be used as a model system.  To determine factors required          for compartmentalization to the vacuole, a proteinase inhibitor from            tomato will be used.  Thess model systems are particularly suitable for         the proposed studies because of the small sizes of the polypeptides and         the wealth of background information available about their structure and        biosynthetic processing.  Genetic manipulations of the genes coding for         these two proteins will be performed, including interchanging of gene           sequences between them, and attachment of the sequences to reporter             genes.                                                                             The results of these experiments are expected to provide us with             important insights into the protein structural features which contain           the information required for proper routing of newly synthesized                proteins to their ultimate subcellular destinations.",
