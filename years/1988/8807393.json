 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Maurice M. Kreevoy,                  Department of Chemistry, University of Minnesota, to pursue with                Dr. In-Sook Han Lee, Department of Chemistry, Science Education                 Research Institute, Kangweon National University, for a period of 24                                                                             +              months, a program of cooperative research on the reduction of NAD               analogues (nicotinamide quarternary salts), including pyridinium,               quinolinium, acridinium, and phenanthridinium halides, by mono- or              disodium phosphonate.  The nature of this reduction will be explored by         characterizing the products by instrumental techniques and by                   determining the mechanism of the reaction by kinetic methods.                                                                                                   The reduction of nicotinamide quarternary salts and their analogs has           been a long standing objective because of the great importance of this          process in biological systems and the possible use of nicotinamide              enzymes in synthetic transformation.  Although many of these reactions          could be valuable in practical organic synthesis, enzyme-catalyzed              oxidation-reduction reactions of this type have not been very                   successful because the reduced cofactors are expensive to produce, some         are not commercially available, some are unstable in solution, and              others leave undesirable by-products.  Phosphonate used as a reducing           agent has several advantages, namely, it is a strong enough reducing                                                                            +               agent to produce a wide range of reactions with a variety of NAD                analogs and it is inexpensive, commercially available, stable in                solution, and its end product is not likely to produce side reactions.          This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea                    Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the level of                cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through            the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques           and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  This project          will add an international cooperative dimension to Dr. Kreevoy's                research under NSF Grant No. CHE-8520903.",
