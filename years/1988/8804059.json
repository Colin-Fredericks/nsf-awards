Students will be selected from Indiana University and                    surrounding states in the Midwest with particular attention to                  smaller institutions and women, minority and disabled students.                 Students will be assigned to ongoing research programs in                       nuclear and accelerator physics.  All students will have the                    opportunity to participate in accelerator-based experiments.                    Students will be supervised by faculty members and senior                       professional staff.  Special programs for the students will be                  arranged, including orientation sessions, weekly seminars, a                    machine shop course, and a closing symposium.                                        This project is supported under the Program of Research                    Experiences for Undergraduates to help ensure an adequate                       supply of scientists for the future.",
