The program of developmental research, on the one                   hand, involves the exploration of new possibilities for                         instrumentation and operational techniques, and for these                       purposes new types of microscopes are being built, tested and                   further evaluated.  On the other hand the Facility provides a                   service for many user groups, to make the most advanced current                 techniques and operational modes accessible for their research                  and to establish and maintain the highest standards of                          performance and interpretation in high resolution electron                      microscopy and associated techniques.  The electron microscopes                 currently used in the Facility for this latter purpose are now                  out-dated, overworked and inadequate in relation to the quality                 and quality of the work demanded of them.  A new microscope which               is more appropriate for the purpose will be acquired.  The new                  microscope is essential also in relation to the educational role                of the Facility.  Through its annual Schools and Workshops and                  continuing interactions with the scientific community the                       Facility has considerable impact on the standards of electron                   microscopy practice and must maintain its instrumentation at, or                beyond, the state of the art in order to perform this function                  adequately.",
