 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the investigation is to study the glass-                  forming ranges, densities, glass transition temperatures, ionic                 conductivities, and infrared transmission spectra of sulfide                    glass systems.  Alkali and silver sulfide, aluminum sulfide, and                boron and phosphorous sulfide glasses will be prepared in                       controlled ambient conditions to eliminate oxygen and water                     vapor.  The physical properties will be determined using direct                 current electrical conductivity, differential scanning                          calorimetry, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, and nuclear               magnetic resonance.  The structure of these glasses will be                     compared to their oxide analogues.                                                                                                                                   The request includes a Research Experience for                             Undergraduates Supplement, which will enable two undergraduate                  students to participate in the study.  It is hoped that this                    hands-on experience will serve as a stimulus to attract highly-                 gifted students into teaching and research careers, as well as to               contribute to the overall goals of this program.                                                                                                                     There is renewed scientific and technological interest in                  the glasses in this general composition range because of their                  potential commercial application in low loss, infrared fiber                    waveguides for optical communications and optical data                          processing.",
