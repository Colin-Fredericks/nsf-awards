 "awd_abstract_narration": "Using the structural literature as a predictive database for the                design of solid state reactions, a series of reactive metal                     carboxylates containing pendant acetylene groups was generated.                 These materials react thermally, or under UV- or y-irradiation,                 to form metal complexes of substituted polyacetylenes.  The                     success of this effort suggested the synthesis of an analogous                  series of metal carboxylates containing pendant vinyl groups.                   Theses complexes react stereospecifically to form crystalline                   metal salts of di-and tricarboxylic acids.  Structural                          information has defined the factors governing the reactivity of                 the metal-acetylene complexes.  However, the lack of sufficient                 structural information on the vinyl compounds has prevented the                 development of structure-reactivity relationships for these                     phases.  For both series an extensive set of synthetic,                         mechanistic, and x-ray structural experiments are proposed in                   order to gain a greater understanding of the chemical and                       structural factors which lead to various types of addition                      reactions.  A proposed study of isomorphous phases promises to                  deepen our understanding of the role of the central metal atom in               these solid state reactions.  In addition to their use in                       synthesis, the crystalline reactants have potential applications                as indicators and dosimeters.",
