 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action is to provide funds for the construction of an enclosure            to the National Geotechnical Centrifuge.                                                                                                                        Centrifuge modeling is a useful tool for studying a wide variety of             geotechnical earthquake engineering problems. The state of stress and           strain in an earth structure is dependent upon the overburden                   pressure, which is analogous to the hydrostatic pressure which                  increases with depth in a body of water. This overburden pressure is a          result of gravitational loading. When testing a scale model of an               earth structure, this gravitational loading must be correctly scaled,           and this requires that gravity be increased in proportion to the                reduction in the scale of the model: a half-scale model has to be               subjected to twice the normal gravity loading. This increase in                 gravity loading can be obtained by testing the scale model in a                 centrifuge.                                                                                                                                                     The National Geotechnical Centrifuge was donated by NASA AMES to the            University of California at Davis. It has been converted for use as a           geotechnical engineering centrifuge, and more recently it was moved to          the Davis campus. It is now operational at the new location, but funds          were not available to provide a roof for the enclosure. As a result,            the centrifuge is operating in the                                              open air, which severely limits the capacity of the machine due                 to windage losses: as the arm turns it acts as a large                          centrifugal fan. These windage losses are unavoidable, but they                 can be reduced significantly by appropriate design of the                       enclosure. For the National Geotechnical Centrifuge, the open pit               installation performance can be increased from 100 g-tons to 500                g-tons by installing a suitably designed enclosure. The increased               performance provides a capacity which is sorely needed in the                   United States. Researchers needing this capacity must currently                 perform their tests on a centrifuge in Cambridge, England. This                 is both costly and slow.                                                                                                                                        The construction of an enclosure for the National Geotechnical                  Centrifuge will provide a facility that will increase                           dramatically the experiments that can be performed in                           geotechnical engineering, in particular in earthquake                           engineering.",
