 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports travel of Indian scientists to              attend the Second International Conference on Case Histories in                 Geotechnical Engineering, in St. Louis, MO., June 1-5, 1988.  The               conference will address case histories in geotechnical and hydrological         management of solid, hazardous and radioactive solids, geological               engineering and rock mechanics, dams, embankments and slopes,                   earthquake engineering and soil dynamics, and soil-structure                    interaction.  Proper documentation of case histories is planned to help         bridge the gap between theory and practice.  In addition, areas of              future research to meet existing needs will be identified.                                                                                                      Scope:  Of some 345 papers from 46 countries submitted for presentation         at the conference, 35 are from Indian scientists and engineers.  The            meeting should bring U.S. and Indian scientists to exchange important           results of research and experiences gained in the two countries, and to         help plan useful collaboration in this area.",
