 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is a combination of two projects, both involving             the deployment of surface current drifters in the central and                   western equatorial Pacific Ocean, and the analysis of their                     trajectories and data collected from current and temprature                     sensors mounted in them,  Both projects involve US, French, and                 Australian institutions.  One project (reviewed under OCE-                      8716509) is a component of a joint field program to study the                   water mass distributions, current structures and transport of the               low-latitude western boundary currents in the western Equatorial                Pacific.  Thirty-five drifters will be deployed in the confluence               of northern and southern hemisphere waters, which arrive at the                 entrance to the Indonesian Seas via the South Equatorial Current,               the New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent, and the Mindanoa Current.                  The second study (OCE-8717243) involves deployment of 350 surfce                drifters over the entire equatorial Pacific over a three-year                   period to determin the upper layer advection and heat content and               its evolution.  In the western Pacific, Richardson will be                      responsible for deployment and analysis, while in the pan-Pacific               study, he will be primarily involved in the data analysis.  Both                experiments are major process studies contributing to the                       objectives of the US TOGA (Tropical and Global Atmosphere)                      Program.",
