 "awd_abstract_narration": "Relative motions between plates in the east Pacific region during          the past 150 m.y. have produced a variety of structural and magmatic            features along the western North American plate margin.  Compilation of         age and composition for the magmatic activity along this margin have            been used to reconstruct the shifting patterns of magmatic belts and            to relate them to changing geometry of subduction and depth of related          magma generation.  However, due to the distribution and quality of              these data more than one interpretation is possible.  This research             will test between the present hypotheses by using age data acquired             along a single corridor across the Cretaceous and Tertiary magmatic             belts in western Mexico.  Results are expected to determine whether             previously proposed regular migrations in western Mexico are adequately         supported by chronology, how far inland these patterns can be followed,         whether there are discontinuities due to lateral translations and               whether resulting patterns can be related to subduction events.",
