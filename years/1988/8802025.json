The focus of the project is the chemistry of transition metal                   compounds in which two metal atoms are bridged by an oxygen                     atom. The results of the project are expected to provide a                      better understanding of the behavior of an important class of                   industrial catalysts, namely heterogeneous catalysts in which                   small metal crystallites are supported on the surfaces of such                  metal oxides as alumina and silica.                                                                                                                             The objective of the project is to develop the chemistry of                     Group VIII transition metal complexes having bridging oxo,                      amido and imido ligands. The research will focus on the                         preparation and reactivity of mixed-metal mu-oxo complexes that                 model metal-support interactions of oxide supported                             heterogeneous catalysts, and on the reactivity of mu-amido and                  mu-imido ligands relevant to catalytic processes that could                     involve these functionalities. Appropriate complexes with these                 bridging ligands will be prepared, and their reactivity will be                 investigated, with emphasis on reactions that involve directly                  the M-O and M-N linkages in the compounds.",
