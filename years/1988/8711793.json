 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this research is to investigate the role and form that error         control should take in the design of future random access memory (RAM)          systems.  A system-wide hierarchic approach to the problem is being             pursued. Both on-chip and board-level error control are being explored          with a focus on assessing the effectiveness of each in controlling              various error sources and the impact each layer has on the other.  The          research includes:  (1) Coding Techniques:  construction of error-              control codes with qualities suited for RAM protection; (2) VLSI                Architectures:  the design and fabrication of VLSI circuits that                implement these codes; and (3) Performance Analysis:  mathematical              analysis of the effectiveness of these codes and the complexity of              their implementation.                                                           The end result of the research will be a better understanding of how to         construct computer memories that are larger, faster and more reliable           than those being designed today.  It will demonstrate how error control         can be used to keep the reliability of RAM systems high even as chip            feature sizes shrink and multi-megabit chips become common.  This               research is a collaborative effort with Dr. Rodney Goodman of the               California Institute of Technology.",
