 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Business Labor Council of Ventura County, an organization                   formed in 1982 under the authority of the State of                              California, will work with county schools, local community                      colleges, and local businesses to enhance science and                           mathematics education programs for non-college-bound                            students.  The county schools, which have substantial                           minority enrollments, find these students have little                           understanding of how mathematics and science courses will                       help prepare them for the job market and avoid these courses                    even if they do not drop out before graduation.  Local                          businesses will work with teachers, guidance counselors, and                    high school classes in a variety of ways to enhance the                         understanding of local job opportunities for non-                               baccalaureate youth and the prerequisites for acquiring and                     succeeding in such jobs.  Included in the program will be                       joint activities with local community colleges to integrate                     high school and community colleges curricula leading to                         locally needed associate degrees.  Students with aptitude for                   baccalaureate programs will be encouraged to enter those, but                   the primary emphasis will be on routes to good career                           opportunities not requiring a baccalaureate degree.                                                                                                             Cost sharing by the other partners will equal 100% of the NSF                   funding.",
