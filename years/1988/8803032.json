 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trypanosomes, like many protozoan parasites, are unable to                      synthesize purines and must rely on the host to provide those                   compounds.  The demand placed on the host's pool of free purines                by a rapidly-growing population of extracellular, bloodstream                   trypanosomes (such as the rodent or African trypanosomes) may                   have one of two effects, either:  (a) marked mobilizaton of                     purines from tissue sites into the bloodstream, or (b) serious                  depletion of the normal, circulating concentrations of purines.                 In either case, the available evidence suggests that significant                alterations of the normal properties and functions of host cells                that display surface adenosine receptors would result (especially               lymphocytes, neutrophils, macrophages and platelets).  The goals                of this research are to investigate changes in bloodstream purine               concentrations and changes in the properties and functions of                   selected host cells during the course of murine infections with                 Trypanosoma musculi.  The concentrations of 16 purines in the                   plasma will be determined (by high performance liquid                           chromatography) at intervals during the course of infection, and                subsequent recovery, of two strains of mice (one, C3H, that is                  particularly susceptible to T. musculi and another, C57Bl/6, that               is considerably less susceptible).  The marked (3-5 fold) rise in               splenocyte activity of the enzymes, adenosine deaminase (ADA) and               purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), which recently has been                  discovered in trypanosome-infected mice will be studied in                      detail.  Specifically it will be determined:  (a) whether or not                the stimulation of these enzymes results from an excess or a                    paucity of purines in the bloodstream, (b) which types of splenic               cells display the elevated enzyme activities, (c) whether or not                the stimulus comes from direct action of the parasites (or                      parasite-derived substances) on cells in which the enzyme                       activity increases or is mediated indirectly through another type               of host cell, and (d) whether or not the elevated enzyme levels                 are associated with depressed capability of infected hosts to                   generate immune responses.  Finally, once it is known how the                   bloodstream concentrations of purines change during infection,                  the effects of similar changes in the properties and functions of               selected cells (B-lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes, neutrophils,                      Kupffer cells and platelets) maintained in vitro will be                        explored.                                                                                                                                                       These studies will provide insight concerning the mechanisms                    through which trypanosome-mediated alterations in host purine                   concentrations result in altered cellular activities, and may                   help to explain the success of trypanosomes in resisting the                    immune responses of their hosts.",
