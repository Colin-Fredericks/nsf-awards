 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) program,                  Continuing Education for Engineering Faculty, consists of 8 short               courses directed at improving the undergraduate engineering faculty's           knowledge of new and developing technical subjects.  These concentrated         courses will be offered in a series of 10-day sessions during the summer        of 1988 at host university and industrial sites in the United States,           including MIT, Polytechnic University in New York, Georgia Tech., RPI,          University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign, AT&T Bell Labs., IBM, Rice             University, State University of New York at Binghamton, and the                 University of Michigan.  Courses will be taught by top faculty members          or industrial instructors, based on well-developed undergraduate                courses.  Course offerings will provide engineering faculty with                technical and pedagogical information in fields related to their own            specialties.  Through lectures, hands-on laboratory activity, and               interaction with instructors, they will learn to incorporate new                material and teaching techniques in revising existing courses and               developing new ones.  Evaluation of learning achieved and faculty               attitudes toward the program will be assessed and used for refining the         program.  Although current courses are concentrated in electrical               engineering and computer science, future courses will be expanded to            include other fields of engineering.                                                                                                                            In addition to the NSF funds, participants will contribute about 60% in         travel and subsistence toward the cost of the program.  Also, industrial        support for 3 of the courses will provide another 60%. Finally, ASEE and        MIT will contribute about 15% in staff time.",
