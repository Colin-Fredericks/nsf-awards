 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Intercollege Graduate Program in Plant Physiology of                        Pennsylvania State University sponsors an Annual Penn State                     Symposium in Plant Physiology on timely topics in plant                         physiology.  Penn State is centrally located along the                          Eastern US seaboard and is a relatively short trip for                          students and scientists in the eastern US.  With the                            institution of the Penn State symposium in 1986, annual                         symposia in plant physiology are now held in the West                           (Riverside, CA), Midwest (U. MO) and East (Penn State).                         %%%                                                                             The aims are to foster in-depth discussion and dialogue among                   researchers, to assess and integrate current knowledge and                      models of light energy transduction from the various                            photosynthetic organisms, and to identify areas in critical                     need for further research.  Light energy transduction is of                     keen interest to a diverse set of scientists who study                          photosynthesis using molecular, genetic, physical, chemical,                    cellular, ecological and agricultural approaches and who                        would likely benefit from a cross-fertilization of                              information, techniques, and approaches.  In addition to its                    scientific importance understanding the mechanism of light                      energy transduction is central to practical efforts to                          manipulate photosynthetic productivity and plant yield - a                      goal of great interest in agriculture and horticulture.",
