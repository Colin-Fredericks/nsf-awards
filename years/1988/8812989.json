 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Blandy Experimental Farm is a 700-acre field research                  station of the University of Virginia.  It is comprised of a                    mosaic of old fields, woodlots, pasture, cropland, and at its                   center, the State Arboretum of Virginia.  Research projects                     underway at the Farm focus on various aspects of the population                 and community ecology of plants and their insect and mammalian                  herbivores.  While no agricultural research is conducted at the                 Farm, crop plants and their insect pests have been used to test                 hypotheses of general ecological importance.  The Farm is well                  suited to support research examining patterns or processes at                   several spatial scales such as the movement of nutrients and                    organisms between different habitats or the interactions of                     individual plants or animals occurring at the level of the local                neighborhood.  The Farm is eminently suited for manipulative                    field experiments in old field or forest habitats, or in                        experimental plantings or gardens.                                                   This project will provide funds to make improvements to an                 existing greenhouse and to purchase two controlled environmental                chambers.  With the additional greenhouse space and controlled                  environment chambers on-site, Blandy Farm will be able to provide               researchers with the facilities to perform experiments under                    three levels of environmental control:  field, greenhouse, and                  growth chamber.",
