 "awd_abstract_narration": "Agonists invoke a variety of intracellular messengers to                   transduce their signals.  To discern the relevant molecules in                  the mediation of a specific cellular function, complimentary                    biochemical and functional assays are required.  This proposal                  outlines experiments to combine these approaches to elucidate the               mechanism of transmitter modulation of neuronal excitability via                second messengers.  To this end, the present application involves               two simple systems where the electrophysiological aspects of                    modulation are well described.  Sensory neurons were chosen as a                model for modulation of Ca++ conductance by amines, such as                     norepinephrine.  Sympathetic neurons were chosen to examine the                 mechanism of cholinergic and peptidergic modulation of K+                       conductance.  The goal of these studies is to determine which                   second messenger systems are employed in the modulation of these                different voltage gated conductances.  The studies share a common               approach:  we will examine several key substrates, products and                 enzyme activities along the metabolic pathways and then compare                 the findings with biophysical studies involving selective                       activation or inhibition at critical junctures in the                           phosphoinositide and arachidonate cascades.  The proposed studies               also share a common goal:  to elucidate the mechanism(s)                        underlying modulation of voltage-gated conductances critical to                 the control of neuronal excitability and transmitter secretion.",
