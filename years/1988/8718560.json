 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Cline wishes to determine the mechanism by which polypeptides               synthesized in the cytosol are transported into the thylakoid                   membranes within the chloroplasts.  Thylakoids are internal                     membranes within cholroplasts.  Approximately 50% of thylakoid                  polypeptides are synthesized within the chloroplast; the                        remainder in the cytosol.  Recent evidence suggests that the                    cytosolically synthesized proteins achieve their functional                     location by a \"soluble intermediate' pathway, in which precursor                proteins pass through both envelope membranes, traverse the                     aqueous stroma in soluble form, and insert into thylakoids by a                 second transport (assembly) process.  Dr. Cline's laboratory has                reconstituted the assembly process with chloroplast subfractions,               but has not yet rigorously demonstrated its involvement in an                   intact system.  The proposed studies will directly investigate                  the soluble intermediate pathway and involvement of the in vitro                assembly process by importing a thylakoid precursor protein into                chloroplasts under conditions that prevent assembly.  Selective                 conditions will be identified by thorough analysis of the                       energetics of the assembly process.  A second objective will                    examine the possibility that chloroplast synthesized proteins.                  and imported proteins are inserted into thylakoids by the same                  assembly apparatus.  Assembly of chloroplast synthesized proteins               will be reconstituted in vitro and the assembly requirements                    compared with those for assembling imported proteins.                              This work will increase our knowledge of the biogenesis of                   chloroplast membrane proteins and will add to a more general                    understanding of how proteins cross membranes.",
