 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three year collaborative between Emory University, Atlanta Public          Schools and IBM will develop a proto-typical model for teaching middle          school teachers to incorporate mathematical/computer microworlds into           the mathematics curriculum.  Each year teams of three teachers from five        middle schools will  participate. Thirteen of the 15 teachers will be           minorities.                                                                                                                                                     The teachers will participate in intense three day session at IBM, two          half-day monthly meetings during the academic year, and with on-site            assistance of Emory staff, use the computer microworlds in their regular        mathematics classes.  Five of these teachers will be chosen to be               mentors to the fifteen new teachers of the next year.  During the third         year, the project will be taught by the Atlanta Public School teachers          and staff.                                                                                                                                                      Anticipated project products include curriculum materials integrating           microworlds into the matheamtics curriculum, teachers development               training materials, and complete descriptions of all project activities         so that the project can be replicated.",
