 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experiments are planned that will combine conventional surface                  analytical techniques with new laser-based methods to examine surface           chemistry in the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of thin semiconductor          films, particularly of gallium arsinide.  These laser techniques                include photoreflectance (PR) and surface second harmonic generation            (SHG).  They will be used to examine the individual steps of                    adsorption, surface diffusion, and desorption in the overall                    deposition mechanism.  Surface bond energies, surface diffusion                 coefficients, and adsorbate interactions will be measured.  The                 surface chemistry of CVD remains virtually uncharted.  This lack of             understanding may result from the weakness of the interactions between          gases and semiconductors.  Ambient pressures greater than 10-4 Torr             are often required to induce significant chemistry, but at these                pressures most conventional surface analytical tools (which employ              charged particles) fail.  PR and SHG have not been widely employed but          are effective at such pressures. Furthermore, high spatial resolution           (~0.5 micron) makes these techniques particularly suited for                    measurements of surface diffusion.  Such data are currently                     nonexistent for semiconductors, even though surface diffusion is                expected to be rate-limiting in many deposition reactions.                                                                                                      Surface chemistry controls impurity incorporation, defect formation,            low-temperature growth rates, and many other deposition phenomena that          are vitally important to the manufacture of thin semiconductor films.           Reliable surface reaction rates and mechanisms are crucial for                  intelligent CVD reactor design.  This is particularly true for gallium          arsinide, for which the current trial-and-error approach to film                growth has yielded only mixed results; the potential application of             gallium arsinide to high-speed circuits and to optoelectronic devices           for communications warrants a major effort toward the understanding of          surface growth phenomena.",
