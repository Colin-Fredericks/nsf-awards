 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This is an award to extend the study of the geochemistry          of an estuary in Malaysia to the major river of Burma, the Irrawaddy.           Dr. Bruce Nelson of the University of Virginia will first conduct a             pilot study on one of its tributaries, the Rangoon River, including             salinity and suspended sediments during the monsoon and post-monsoon            periods.  The physical measurements will combine chemical studies with          hydrographic and sediment transport measurements.  The Burma Ports              Corporation will provide boat transport for field research, and a shore         laboratory for sample preparation and simple analyses.  Most analyses           will be conducted at the University of Virginia, in the trace element           laboratories, with a range of instruments.                                                                                                                      Scope:  Geochemical calculations are a significant part of the                  scientific basis for a program of marine pollution monitoring.  The             United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the Intergovernmental             Oceanographic Commission (IOC) have emphasized the importance of                fundamental understanding of river inputs to the sea.  There are few            studies in tropical estuarine systems.  Their work on small Malaysian           rivers shows that there is a store of fundamental information to be             gleaned from a careful study of tropical estuaries.  This research can          also be applied to practical development needs, by providing                    information on harbor siltation. It is recommended under the Science in         Developing Countries Program.",
