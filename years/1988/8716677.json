 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is in support of the study of the interaction of Byrd                Glacier with the Ross Ice Shelf, with attention focused on the                  lateral rift zones of the floating ice stream tongue embedded in                the ice shelf.  Field data will consist of ice elevations and                   thicknesses mapped by radar sounding and ice velocities mapped                  photogrammetrically.  Surface strain rates will be computed from                the velocity data.  Finite-element modeling will investigate two                aspects of rift-zone dynamics; the stress field in the rift zone                for given creep and fracture rheologies and the temperature field               in a flowband that begins at the East Antarctic ice divide and                  ends at the calving front of the Ross Ice Shelf.                                                                                                                The significance of this research is that it will provide a                     physically based means for quantifying the buttressing of Byrd                  Glacier by the Ross Ice Shelf.  The models developed will have                  applications, with appropriate modifications, to other ice streams              entering the Ross Ice Shelf, and will be useful in understanding                dynamic processes along any flowband that has sheet-flow, stream-               flow, and shelf-flow components.",
