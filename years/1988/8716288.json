 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Prof. Karen              McNally of the University of Santa Cruz and Dr. J. Gonzalez-Ruiz of             the Centro de Investigacion Cientifica y de Educacion Superior de               Ensenada (CISECE) in Mexico.  Recent studies have focused on                    intermediate depth seismicity, looking at the stresses and geometries           associated with subduction processes.  Evidence has been found                  suggesting that subducting plates \"tear\" into segments at locations             of sharp changes in either the geometry of the trench or the dip of             the downgoing plate or both.  Other evidence suggests that downgoing            plates are highly deformable.  The investigators plan to extend                 present studies to include a detailed study of the structure of the             subducting Cocos plate at the Tehuantepec transition zone beneath               Mexico.  This region is of interest because, among other reasons, it            may be the location of the triple junction between the Cocos-North              America-Caribbean plates; it is transitional between shallow angle              and steep angle subduction; volcano geometry, trench depth, plate               age, and other features change at this location; it is a seismic gap            with unknown potential; and fault mechanism and seismicity                      distribution change markedly from those of other areas of Mexico.                                                                                               The investigators will use an observational approach by assembling              very accurate depths and focal mechanisms of regional earthquakes via           synthetic waveform modeling.  Based on this earthquake data set, the            geometry and the nature and direction of stress and coupling between            and within the overriding and downgoing plates will be determined.              The work will lead to a significant publication regarding earthquake            mechanisms, tectonic framework, and seismic risk.",
