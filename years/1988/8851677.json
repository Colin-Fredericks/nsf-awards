 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gas Chromatography/mass spectroscopy is being integrated into the               undergraduate laboratory experience.  Current literature in analytical          chemistry reveal a growing dependence upon GC/MS techniques, especially         in the areas of Environmental Protection Agency priority pollutant              analysis and in the rapidly expanding field of drug analysis.  Exposure         to such a system at the undergraduate level would be an advantageous            introduction to advanced methods of chemical analysis.  In particular,          the Ion Trap System available from Finnigan MAT is being employed. This         recently introduced instrument has several potential advantages for use         at the undergraduate level including increased durability and lower             maintenance than corresponding quadrupole or magnetic sector mass               spectrometers and simplified operation through complete computer                control.  These factors are of primary importance for the undergraduate         laboratory where the system is subjected to users with varying degrees          of competence.  The department has recently converted the organic               laboratory to microscale which results in an inherent dependence upon           advanced instrumentation for analysis.  The high selectivity and                sensitivity of the GC/MS system is ideally suited for microscale                analysis and the Ion Trap System is being incorporated into the                 sophomore year organic chemistry for analysis of student prepared               compounds.  Additionally, the instrument is being employed in junior            year analytical chemistry for the separation and analysis of                    multicomponent mixtures and for an introduction to computer controlled          instrumentation through programming in FORTH language.  The instrument          is also becoming an integral part of the strong research program,               allowing more efficient utilization of the instrument with year-round           use.
