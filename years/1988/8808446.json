 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program is directed at elucidating the reactivity                     patterns of coordination and organometallic compounds. Of                       particular interest are the kinetics and mechanisms of                          reactions of such compounds which are pertinent to catalytic                    applications. Specific themes include: (1) The mechanisms of                    asymmetric catalytic hydrogenation and related reactions and                    the origin of enantioselectivity in such reactions.                             (2) Determination of transition-metal alkyl bond dissociation                   energies and of the thermodynamics of organometallic reactions.                 (3) Mechanism and catalysis of CO migratory insertion reactions                 and the utilization of such catalysis to increase the rates and                 selectivities of CO-utilizing homologation reactions.                           (4) Coordination chemistry and catalytic properties of                          transition metal polyhydride complexes, especially those with                   phosphine ligands, with emphasis on the utilization of such                     compounds as catalysts for the hydrogenation of ketones, esters                 and arenes, and for the activation of C-H bonds. The methods                    employed in these studies include kinetic measurements                          (including techniques for measurement of the rates of fast                      reactions) and the use of NMR, FTIR and other spectroscopic                     methods to characterize intermediates in catalytic cycles.                                                                                                      This project is expected to provide a better understanding of                   the operation of some important industrial catalysts and to                     contribute to the rational design of new catalysts.",
