 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Alfredo H-S. Ang, Department         of Civil Engineering, University of Illinois, and                               Dr. Masanobu Shinozuka, Department of Civil Engineering and Operations          Research, Princeton University, to pursue with Dr. Hyo-Nam Cho,                 Department of Civil Engineering, Hanyang University and Korea Military          Academy, and Dr. Chung-Bang Yun, Department of Civil Engineering, Korea         Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, for a period of 24                months, a program of cooperative research on reliability-based                  rehabilitation of civil structures against natural hazards.  These              researchers will develop quantitative damage models for steel and               reinforced concrete structures and use them to assess the degree of             damage and/or deterioration of existing civil structures.  They also            will develop nondestructive tests and knowledge-based expert systems            for field experimentation.  The results of these activities will be             used to develop a strategy for rating the reliability of bridges and            other structures.  The ratings then may be used to recommend                    replacement or rehabilitation.                                                                                                                                  As civil structures approach their original intended design life, the           degree of damage and/or deterioration must be assessed in order to              determine if they need to be rehabilitated or replaced.  This                   assessment also can be used to (1) determine their reliability when             subjected to extreme loads such as heavy traffic and natural hazards            (high winds and earthquakes) and (2) reach decisions on the degree of           rehabilitation or whether replacement is required.  The problems                addressed by this project are common ones whose solution would be               beneficial to the United States and Korea.  This project is relevant to         the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which              seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean              scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific                     information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on         problems of mutual benefit.",
