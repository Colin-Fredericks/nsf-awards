 "awd_abstract_narration": "The quality of scientific training offered to students is being                 improved with the purchase of a high pressure liquid chromatography             instrument for use in five laboratory courses.  This is allowing the            department to include as a part of the students' scientific training            the principles and practice of HPLC - the most versatile method for             separating and quantitating the variety of complex mixtures which               chemists encounter.  Introduction of the HPLC into the Chemistry                Department's laboratory curriculum is enabling students to work with a          wider range of mixtures - especially those containing non-volatile              solids or thermally sensitive compounds - than was previously possible          with the departmental instrumentation.  For instance, the students are          doing experiments involving the separation and quantitation of proteins         in a mixture or determining the lipid composition of a cellular                 membrane.  Including these new experiments in the laboratory program of         the department is significant because it is enhancing the ability of            the science students to investigate chemical systems and solve chemical         problems.
