 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on the design of distributed databases is proposed.  We have           already investigated in detail the problems of vertical and horizontal          fragmentation of data and their redundandt and nonredundant allocation          in a distributed environment.  With the present proposal, we plan to            extend our research in the following areas:                                                                                                                     a)  Integrate the present work into a comprehensive methodology by                  combining the fragmentation and allocation schemes.  Refine                     existing models by incorporating further details of transaction                 processing and system overheads.  Study the effect of network                   topology and communication costs.                                                                                                                           b)  Investigate models for optimal refragmentation and reallocation                 with possible replication.  Develop design heuristics.                                                                                                      c)  Investigate the development of design tools, user interaction,                  graphic support, etc., to enable designers to apply the design                  methodology in practice to realistic problems.  In particular,                  evaluate the applicability of design heuristics in a expert-                    system like environment to achieve fairly acceptable solutions to               the design problem.",
