 "awd_abstract_narration": "The sensory cells of the inner ear are called hair cells,                  and they are responsible for hearing and balance.  With modern                  tools, there has been a new sophistication in analyzing how these               receptors work at the cellular level.  This conference will bring               together biophysicists, biochemists, pharmacologists, physiol-                  ogists and anatomists to focus on three major topics: hair cell                 motility, information processing, and intercellular connections                 among hair cells and nerve cells.  The emphasis will be on                      reaching some consensus on these three topics, since they have                  recently emerged as leading issues, as the technology to address                them has advanced in the last decade.  The impact of this meeting               is likely to be a new formulation of the role of interactions                   between the peripheral sensory system and the central nervous                   system, and will be important to understanding sensory processing               in general, as well as understanding auditory and vestibular                    function in particular.",
