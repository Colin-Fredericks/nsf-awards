 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research has two aspects: proving lower bounds on the resources            needed to solve problems and finding algorithms which meet those                resource bounds.                                                                                                                                                A major focus of this research is on how various features of parallel           models affect the resources needed for performing computations.                                                                                                 Large shared-memory machines are likely to be implemented on processor          interconnection networks and this implementation suggests shared-memory         models with even more powerful primitive operations than those of the           machines previously studied - primitive operations like unbounded fan-          in threshold functions and other unbounded fan-in associative                   operations.  Under investigation are the limitations and capabilities           of these more powerful machines which have recently been proposed as            very useful abstractions of large parallel computers.                                                                                                           There still are a number of very basic computational problems such as           division, connectivity, and transitive closure for which parallel               algorithms exist but whose parallel complexity is not clearly                   understood.                                                                     It is particularly important to improve the resource usage for these            basic problems because the algorithms for solving them underlie the             parallel algorithms for many more complex problems.",
