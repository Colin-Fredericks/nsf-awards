 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Museum of Northern Arizona has a unique collection of Navajo rugs           and blankets that document a continuum of change in the technological           development of Navajo weaving from its Pueblo, Spanish, and Anglo-              American influenced roots to its present regional styles.  This is one          of the best documented collections in the country.  It is a collection          that is extensively used by scholars who are interested in material             culture.                                                                        Large organic materials such as textiles require special storage                favilities.  The Museum of Northern Arizona, due to a lack of space and         proper shelving has been forced to fold and stack their textiles,               causing damage to the objects and making them inaccesible for research.         The Museum requires new storage sheving to roll their collection and            halt the deterioration.  The storage equipment chosen for this project          will retard insect infestation, protect the textiles from dust, prevent         damage to the fibers from stress due to creases, and redtard photodegr-         adation.  This equipment will also make the textiles more accessible to         researchers.                                                                    The collections at the Museum of Northern Arizona are important for             cintinued research in anthropology.  Theyt have great scientific value          and the improgvements in storage will sitmulat additonal research.//",
