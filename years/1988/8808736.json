 "awd_abstract_narration": "Attachment theory, formulated by John Bowlby in an influential                  three-volume study, currently provides one of the best                          explanations of emotional bonding between young children and                    their parents.  It also explains what happens when emotional                    bonds are disrupted or severed (for example, through separation                 or death).  Bowlby intended the theory to apply, in his words,                  \"from the cradle to the grave\" (that is, to serve as a lifespan                 theory of attachments), but until recently few researchers had                  attempted to study adult love from an attachment-theoretical                    perspective.  In several exploratory studies considerable support               has been obtained for predictions derived from the                              theory--predictions concerning the way love is experienced by                   people with different attachment styles (secure, avoidant,                      anxious/ambivalent), the differential divorce rates of people                   with different attachment histories, the proneness of adults with               insecure attachment styles to chronic loneliness, and so on.                                                                                                    This research will extend the line of work in several ways:  (1)                improving preliminary measures of adult attachment style,                       attachment history, and attachment-related phenomena (such as                   emotional experiences at work, patterns of sexual motivation and                sexual problems, and ability to offer empathic, sensitive care to               a relationship partner); (2) examining connections between                      attachment style, attachment history, and behavioral assessments                of relationship quality (such as marital conflict and                           communication coded from laboratory videotapes); (3) examining                  longitudinally the early phases of adult love relationships to                  see how attachment variables influence the course of relationship               development (including break-up, in cases where that occurs); and               (4) probing, through intensive interviews, the life histories                   (particularly the relationship histories) of people whose                       attachment styles have changed over time from insecure to secure.                                                                                               The research should deepen the theoretical foundation of                        the emerging close relationship field, tying it to existing work                in ethology and developmental psychology.  It should help                       integrate important social psychological findings.",
