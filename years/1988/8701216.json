 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fernstrom Symposium on the Neuromuscular Junction will be                   held from 6 to 11 June 1988 as a satellite symposium of the                     European Society for Neurochemistry meeting to be held in                       Gothenburg, Sweden.  The symposium will have 46 speakers: 19 from               the United States, 22 from Europe, 2 from Canada and 1 each from                Japan, Israel and Venezuela.  The remaining 100 participants will               be invited to present poster presentations.  The scientific                     program will consist of 6 sessions over 3 1/2 days.  The topics                 will include: ion channel structure and function; transmitter                   release; the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; excitation-                      contraction coupling; genetic expression and regulation in nerve                and muscle and degenerative disease mechanisms.  Numerous                       advances have been made in these areas.  The purpose of this                    symposium is to create a forum where leading scientists can                     present their findings, discuss their relevance to our overall                  understanding of presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms, and to                identify important unresolved issues.  The aim is to promote the                spread of this knowledge to younger investigators who will be                   encouraged to attend, and to the scientific community in general                through the rapid publication of the proceedings.  The purpose of               this application is to obtain funding for trans-Atlantic airfare                for American speakers.  A similar proposal for the same purpose                 and amount is being submitted to the National Institutes of                     Health.  If both grants are funded, the round-trip airfare for 18               of the 19 American speakers will be covered. Since this meeting                 is a satellite symposium of the European Society for                            Neurochemistry meeting (12-17 June 1988), it provides an                        opportunity for Americans to attend this second scientific                      congress.  Room and board for the American speakers will be                     provided by a grant from the Fernstrom Foundation (Sweden).  The                trans-Atlantic airline tickets will be purchased from American                  carriers.",
