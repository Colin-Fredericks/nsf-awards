 "awd_abstract_narration": "This renewal proposal of NSF grant ECS-8501433 is for the study of new          excimer and anti-Stokes Raman laser systems primarily in the VUV and            XUV regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.  The proposed research             will utilize the unique capabilities of two different complimentary             approaches of electron beam and laser-produced plasma excitation                developed during recent years at Rice University.  A new class of               molecules, the ionic alkali halide excimer, was recently predicted and          discovered by the PI.  Their spectroscopy as well as mechanisms                 leading to their production will be investigated.  Possible excitation          schemes include Penning ionization processes to a second ionization             potential via collision with electron-beam-produced metastable helium           and neon atoms.  Optical excitation of these highly-excited states              through excimer laser ablation of molecules from solid surfaces and             soft x-ray excitation of alkali vapors will also be studied.  This is           a novel approach since this excitation technique has thus far only              been applied to atomic systems.  A search for new triatomic rare gas            halide excimers will also be carried out to clarify their kinetic               behavior.  In addition, new pumping schemes for known lasers as well            as the development of novel laser sources based on new spectroscopic            information will be investigated.  One such scheme will utilize a               novel optical excitation technique employing glass cones (axicons) in           order to optically pump the rare gas excimers.  This could result in            simple milliwatt average power tunable VUV sources.  Other proposed             schemes include anti-Stokes Raman lasers in the rare gas excimer,               atomic oxygen, and the collisional excitation of quasi-metastable               quartet states of the alkali atoms.",
