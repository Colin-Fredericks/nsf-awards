 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research includes experiments aimed at understanding the                   intracellular transport and secretion of enzymes from                           aleurone cells of barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv Himalaya).                      Because of their unique properties, isolated aleurone                           protoplasts have been exploited for studies of protein                          secretion.  The response of protoplasts isolated from barley                    aleurone to gibberellic acid and calcium is qualitatively                       similar to that of isolated aleurone layers.  Using                             protoplasts this lab has shown that precursor forms of the                      low isoelectric point (low-pI) group of a-amylase isozymes                      are covalently modified to the secreted forms of the enzyme.                    This modification results in the lowering of isozyme pI                         without significantly affecting the molecular weight of the                     protein.  Results to date show that these isozymes are not                      modified by glycosylation, phosphorylation or sulfation.                        Rather the data indicate a form of posttranslational                            modification of secreted proteins involving side-chain                          acylation.  Radiolabel from \u013114C!acetate is specifically                        incorporated into secreted forms of low-pI a-amylase.  The                      precursor of the secreted protein is not labeled, so acetate                    is not incorporated into a-amylase via its metabolism into                      amino acids or sugars.  Amino-terminal acetylation of high-pI                   a-amylase is also ruled out since these proteins are end-                       blocked.  Experiments are designed to investigate the precise                   nature of a-amylase acylation and the possible function of                      this covalent modification.  Experiments with Xenopus oocytes                   that provide information on the role of protein acylation in                    secretion are also being conducted.                                                                                                                             The secretion of macromolecules to the cell exterior is a                       fundamental process of higher plant and animal cells.  This                     process is particularly important in plant seeds when stored                    food reserves are mobilized during germination.  Our                            knowledge of intracellular transport of the enzymes involved                    is incomplete.  This research addresses this knowledge gap.***//",
