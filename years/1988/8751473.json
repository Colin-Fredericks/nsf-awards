 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goals of the project are to provide experienced mathematics            teachers at the middle and junior high school levels opportunities to           immerse themselves in the use of technology to explore and to teach             mathematics, to prepare leaders among the teachers who can communicate          their technological knowledge to other teachers, and to produce teaching        materials built around the technology which can be used for workshops as        well as for student instruction.                                                                                                                                Twenty participants are selected from among those recommended by the            school districts that have committed to the project. The participants           take courses during the summers 1988 and 1989 as well as during the             academic year that deal with investigations on mathematics and                  pedagogical topics, such as probability, problem solving, geometry, and         the development of curriculum materials. There is also an interwoven            strand of courses that emphasize technology-related topics, such as             computers in the classroom, using technology to teach instructional             computing research, using technology to teach mathematics, and problem          solving using computers.",
