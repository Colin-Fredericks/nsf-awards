 "awd_abstract_narration": "A swallowtail butterfly (Papilio glaucus) is an exceptional                insect herbivore because of the breadth of its diet (polyphagy)                 and extent of geographic distribution.  Evidence suggests that                  this is allowed by genetic variability within and among P.                      glaucus populations.  Parallel investigations of host quality                   have also indicated important intraspecific variability.  The                   array of host plants encountered by P. glaucus at 3 sites                       (southern Michigan, northern Michigan, and interior Alaska) will                be compared.  Variablility between sites, between host species                  within sites, and between trees within host species will be                     compared using bioassays.  Variability of full-sibling families                 across 7 sympatric host species.  Reciprocal transplants of P.                  glaucus populations among the 3 sites will allow simultaneous                   tests for geographic differentiation between insect populations                 and host populations.  Collectively, these experiments test the                 constancy of insect-plant interactions.  The hypothesis that                    average characteristics of the insect and plant species are poor                predictors of interactions between individual plants and                        individual insects will be tested.  As a counterpoint, abiotic                  environments encountered by P. glaucus at each site will be                     contrasted, and localized adaptation of the insect to different                 thermal regimes will be tested.  Patterns of genetic variability                in insect traits surveyed here will provide information about                   evolutionary lability of important physiological attributes, and                may separate environmental factors that lead to local adaptation                from those that constrain distributions.",
