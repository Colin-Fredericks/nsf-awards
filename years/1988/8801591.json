 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a continuation of studies in denotational semantics and its             applications to the design and implementation of programming languages.         Areas of study include semantics and type-checking for object-oriented          programming systems and the continued study of reflection and                   semantics-directed compiler generation.                                                                                                                         The activities at work in OOP include a uniform reference principle,            information-hiding, inheritance, and distributed definition.  Uniform           reference principle, refers to the use of field selection or message-           passing as a generic way of retrieving data from composite structures.          Information-hiding, refers to the typical way in which the internal             structure of an object is protected from the outside world: the                 \"instance variables\" of an object are manipulable only through the              interface of the \"methods\".  Inheritance refers to the manner in which          new classes of objects are created as incremental variations of old             ones.  Distributed definition refers to the syntactic structure of              class definitions in certain object systems, in which the definitions           of the methods may be textually distributed through a program or                systems.",
