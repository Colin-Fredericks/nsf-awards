 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has long been recognized that there is a relationship between                stressful life events and disease.  For example, grief and                      bereavement appear to be associated with increased morbidity and                mortality among the survivors.  Depression, which often follows a               loss or a separation is associated with a twofold increase in                   risk of cancer over a 17-year follow-up period.  Similar,                       significant correlations, although retrospective, exist between                 stressful life events and the incidence or onset of major medical               disorders, including AIDS.  Given such correlations, it becomes                 important to examine what impact stress has on immune function.                 Dr. Linda Watkins will focus her research efforts on two inter-                 related questions which, taken together, should shed light on the               underlying bases of immune responses to stress.  First, a                       systematic examination will be performed to clearly define the                  temporal window within which exposure to stress can alter the                   immunologic response to antigenic challenge.  Second, studies                   will be done aimed at defining mechanisms which allow these                     changes in immune function to occur.  Standard plasma and tissue                assays will be used.",
