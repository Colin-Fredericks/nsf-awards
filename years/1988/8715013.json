 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Professor                Rita B. Blumstein, University of Lowell, Massachusetts, and Dr.                 Ferdinand Volino, Centre d'Etudes Nucleaires de Grenoble, France,               in the area of polymer liquid crystals (PLC's) and compounds from               conventional thermoplastics, which can model PLC's.  Novel                      liquid-crystal polymers and compounds which can be used as models               for them will be synthesized, and their structure will be studied               at the microscopic level, using nuclear magnetic resonance and                  neutron and X-ray scattering.  Their thermodynamic and mechanical               properties will be studied at the macroscopic level.  This                      research will continue a seven-year collaborative effort, which                 has yielded important results in other areas of polymer studies.                                                                                                The U.S. and French researchers have complementary skills, and the              Grenoble laboratory possesses equipment not available otherwise to              the U.S. principal investigator.  NMR and neutron scattering, and               investigation of the microscopic properties of the model systems,               will be done at Grenoble;  macroscopic properties will be                       investigated at Lowell.  One graduate student from the U.S. will                also be trained in the microscopic techniques at Grenoble.  The                 project should increase our understanding of polymeric liquid                   crystal systems, and could result in the development of new liquid              crystal materials with improved impact resistance and                           transparency.",
