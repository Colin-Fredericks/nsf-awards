 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cosmic rays represent one of the longer data bases for studying             the temporal variation of solar activity.  The availability of                  continuous data records during several solar cycles from a neutron              monitor is important for a wide variety of investigations of the                cosmic ray modulation.  For example, data from neutron monitors are             essential for evaluating the extent of the modulation of high energy            cosmic-rays and possible asymmetries in this modulation from cycle to           cycle: these data also serve as a baseline for lower-energy                     cosmic-ray gradient measurements and help to understand the                     propagation of energetic particles in solar cosmic-ray events.                      This grant will continue the operation of the cosmic-ray neutron            monitors at Mt. Washington and Durham and continue studies which                relate these ground-based cosmic-ray observations to near earth                 cosmic ray telescope data from the IMP series of spacecraft and                 similar data at large distances from the earth acquired from Pioneers           10 and 11 and Voyagers 1 and 2.  Mt. Washington is the only high                latitude neutron monitor providing continuous data coverage over                almost three solar cycles, the data from that station have been used            as standard indicators of the energetic cosmic-ray flux at earth by             balloon and satellite experiments on a worldwide basis.  Currently              many other groups request the data as a time base for spacecraft and            balloon measurements.  The inclusion of these ground-based                      observations provides an essential additional dimension to the                  spacecraft measurements.                                                            The grant will support the following specific problems using the            Mt. Washington and spacecraft data described above: (1) the cosmic              ray intensities at earth and at heliocentric distances beyond 15                Astronomical Unit (AU) during the recovery phase of the current                 modulation cycle; (2) the integral and differential radial cosmic-ray           gradients 45 AU; (3) latitudinal intensity gradients; (4) the effect            of the heliospheric boundary upon the cosmic-ray intensity; (5) other           studies, to include the phase-lag effects during the decreasing and             increasing portions of different solar cycles, a comparison of the              cosmic-ray modulation in the last three solar cycles particularly at            periods of minimum modulation, the Forbush-type decrease of February            6, 1986, and (6) the acceleration, injection and propagation of the             protons in the May 7, 1978 and February 16, 1984 solar cosmic ray               events.",
