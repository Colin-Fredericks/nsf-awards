 "awd_abstract_narration": "The structure of a shrub community in the understory of a                  tropical rainforest will be studied by determining the site-                    specific demography of several species of Piper with overlapping,               but not identical, distributions relative to site disturbance                   history.  Measurements of survival and growth rates of plant life               stages in different habitats will indicate to what extent the                   distributions and abundances of Piper species are due to the                    differential mortality, if any, of life stages in various each                  habitats.  These data will also help elucidate the ecological                   roles and relative importance of vegetative propagation versus                  seed production.  Dispersal and differential reproduction will                  also be examined.  The distributions of all of the Piper species                in the locality will be quantified with respect to a series of                  environmental parameters.  The morphological and reproductive                   charateristics of all of these species in this locality will be                 compared to those from another location to ascertain if there are               suites of characters in this genus that are consistently                        correlated with species distributions.  The project will                        contribute to our understanding of the ways in which plant                      distributions and population sizes are regulated, and hence to                  our understanding of plant community structure.",
