 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a three year project for 28 exemplary high school biology               teachers from a region within a 200-mile radius of  Southern                    Illinois University at Carbondale. It is designed to implement                  the following goals:  (1) identify and recognize these teachers                 for inservice training in research methodology and application of               the inquiry process to teaching high school biology; (2) improve                the quality of education by enhancing the professional competence               of biology teachers and to engage these teachers in all phases of               laboratory research, allowing them to become more confident in                  practicing science and inquiry approach; (3) offer these teachers               pedagogical training in science teaching strategies to support                  the content in teaching high school biology; and (4) honor those                teachers in a socially significant and tangible manner.                                                                                                         Fourteen professors of science with active research programs will               serve as mentors and will work with 2 teachers each for the                     duration of the project.  In this three phase program, teachers                 will be given a thorough preparation and background for                         conducting their research, will actively work on their research                 project under the tutelage of their mentor, and will develop                    materials that will enable them to carry the results and the                    methodology of their research to their students.  Rural clusters                of experienced teachers will provide inservice for their peers                  and the National Association of Biology Teachers (NABT)                         electronic bulletin board network will facilitate dissemination                 among the teachers and between the teachers and their University                mentors.  In addition, coursework of the participant's own                      choosing is offered tuition-free by the University.",
