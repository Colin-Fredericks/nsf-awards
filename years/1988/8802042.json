 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research project is to investigate the               molecular mechanisms for the differential expression of the 5S                  RNA gene families of Xenopus laevis during early development.                   Transcription of the abundant oocyte-type 5S RNA gene is                        selectively switched off as the frog eggs develop into tadpoles.                In contrast, the less abundant somatic-type 5S RNA gene remain                  active.  Dr. Peck's development of an in vitro transcription                    system which mimics the differential expression of the two types                of genes will be exceedingly useful for biochemical approaches to               this phenomenon.  Recently Dr. Peck has succeeded in                            fractionating this transcription extract into components which                  further accentuate the selective transcription of the two types                 of genes.  Using a biochemical approach, he plans to purify the                 component in the fractionated extract which is responsible for                  the selective inhibition of the oocyte-type 5S RNA genes.  In                   addition, he will analyze the proteins associated with the                      transcriptionally active versus inactive 5S RNA genes with the                  hope of correlating structure with function.  Several facets of                 this project revolve around exploring the effects of the flanking               sequences on the control of the two gene families.  The proposed                projects include searching for proteins which interact with the                 flanking sequences and the construction of clones containing                    oocyte-specific 5S RNA genes and somatic-type spacers.  Finally,                he plans to investigate the binding of TFIIIA to the 5S RNA genes               in developing embryos using the technique of in vivo                            footprinting.  The knowledge of when during development TFIIIA is               complexed with the oocyte-type 5S RNA genes will place severe                   restrictions on the possible mechanisms responsible for the                     selective inhibition of transcription of this gene family.                      %%%                                                                                  The long-range objective of the proposed research is to                    explore the molecular basis for the selective expression of the                 5S RNA gene families of Xenopus laevis during embryonic                         development.  Specifically, Dr. Peck wants to learn how a                       particular class of genes, the oocyte family of 5S RNA genes, is                selectively repressed as the fertilized frog egg develops into a                tadpole.  An understanding of the control of gene expression is                 of crucial importance for learning how genetic information is                   transformed into the functioning organism.  As an organism                      develops and groups of cells differentiate to perform specialized               functions, whole families of genes within these cells must be                   coordinately controlled.  Understanding how the families of 5S                  RNA genes are regulated during development will contribute to an                understanding of the mechanisms which are used to regulate the                  families of genes which control the developmental fate of                       differentiating cells.  This is a central problem in                            developmental biology and may provide insights into related                     problems such as the generation of developmental abnormalities                  during human embryological development.",
