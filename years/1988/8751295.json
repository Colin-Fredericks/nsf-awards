 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide about 60% of the funding for a third and              fourth year extension of a previously funded teacher development project        entitled \"Expansion of Computer Education in Learning the Sciences\",            (ExCELS).  The remaining funds for the project will be provided by              Indiana University of Pennsylvania and the school districts of the              participating teachers.                                                                                                                                         Leadership training in both content and pedagogy will be provided for           two separate groups of 60 science and mathematics teachers/coordinators         during the summers of 1988 and 1989.  Following the summer workshop,            participants will implement project developed activities in their own           classrooms, and subsequently provide inservice programs for their peers         which will enable the peers to implement computer use into the teaching         of their academic disciplines.  Science participants will be selected           from the disciplines of biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science,         while mathematics participants will represent teachers of the entire            grade range, K-12. The acquisition  of the necessary hardware and               software, as well as support for the post summer inservice programs             conducted by the participants will be provided by the school districts.         An electronic mail network will provide mutual support for the                  participants as they implement the activities in their classrooms and           provide inservice to their peers.                                                                                                                               This proposal is meritorious for funding because of the quality of work         produced in the phases already funded, the well-thought out plan for            extending the expertise of the participants to their peers through              inservice, the emphasis on the use of technology in relevant science            instruction and the interdisciplinary thrust of relating science and            mathematics in school systems involved.  The plan for production of a           resource book of the activities involved will provide further                   dissemination and adoption of the project results.",
