 "awd_abstract_narration": "NCSA requests funding to conduct a two-week Supercomputer Summer                Institute in June 1988 for 33 young scientists and engineers.  The              supercomputer manufacturer, Cray Research Inc., will pay for three of           these students, while eight will be employees of NCSA's industrial              partners.  NSF will thus support the remaining 22 students.                     Selection will be made by a panel of NCSA academic staff researchers.                                                                                           The NCSA facilities will be open 24 hours per day and include                   advanced workstations and graphics engines and an Apple Macintosh for           each student.  Access wil be provided to the Center's current                   supercomputer, the Cray XMP-48, with remote access to a Cray 2                  supercomputer with a very large main memory.                                                                                                                    Students will be taught the mechanics of using a vector supercomputer           and will also be exposed to lectures from computational scientists              and engineers in a variety of disciplines to broaden the students'              research horizons.                                                                                                                                              An award to NCSA for a 1988 Supercomputer Summer Institute is                   recommended in the amount of $42,062.",
