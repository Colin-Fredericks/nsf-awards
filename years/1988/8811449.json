 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of electrochemical interfaces.                    This research continues the Principal Investigator's application                of photoelectron and infrared reflection spectroscopies to                      characterize the structure and composition of the electrochemical               interphase.  Studies of the electrochemical double-layer employing              the electrode emersion technique will be performed in order to                  clarify fundamental aspects of double-layer structure.  These                   include  the role of water in the double-layer, interfacial chi                 potential differences, absolute half-cell potentials, and                       reference levels for liquid ESCA.  The studies will be correlated               with theoretical models of the emersed double-layer.                                                                                                            The electrochemical double-layer plays a principal role in                      determining the kinetics and mechanisms of electrochemical                      reactions.  Removal of a charged electrode from the electrolyte                 leaves the very thin double-layer region principally intact, while              stripping the bulk electrolyte from the surface.  This emersion                 process makes possible determination of the structure and                       composition of the double-layer by applying surface analytical                  techniques such as photoelectron and infrared spectroscopies.                   Measurement of the work function of the emersed electrode surface               allows estimation of single electrode potentials.",
