 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is establishing a Geographic Information System (GIS)           teaching facility that permits students to learn fundamental principles         of computerized cartography and spatial data analysis.  GIS products            including specialized maps and overlays are being used in a variety of          classes and teaching situations, both as examples of computer                   applications and as specific aids in courses in biogeography and                applied ecology.                                                                                                                                                   The proposal includes funding for both software and hardware needed          in creating and maintaining a geographic database for Mt. Desert Island         and its immediate surroundings.  Students select specific regions of            the island and by digitizing a series of maps containing data ranging           from hydrology to current land-use patterns, create a comprehensive             picture of the island's biogeography.  As the project develops,                 increasing areas will be covered and the resulting digital model will           be available to both the academic and general community as an aid in            planning, resource use, and development.  The project provides students         a unique opportunity to interact with and to learn to apply state-of-           the-art cartographic techniques.                                                                                                                                   The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal sum          obtained from non-Federal sources.",
