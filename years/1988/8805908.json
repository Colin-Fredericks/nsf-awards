 "awd_abstract_narration": "A hierarchy of numerical models will be used to investigate                the interactions between radiation, dynamics and chemistry of the               atmosphere, especially in regard to climatic effects of increases               in atmospheric trace gases.  The three year project will utilize                2-D models of the stratosphere and the troposphere to study                     effects of trace gas increases on global and regional ozone                     production, as well as the combined effects of changes in ozone                 and other radiatively active trace gases on the tropospheric                    climate.  There are significant differences in initial radiative                forcing between increases in CO2 versus other radiatively-                      active trace gases.  General circulation model simulations using                the Community Climate Model of the National Center for                          Atmospheric Research will be carried out to investigate any                     differences in subsequent climatic feedbacks caused by increased                CO2 and other trace gases.                                                                                                                                           This project should enhance our capability to model                        important physical and chemical processes that affect the climate               system and may lead to improved understanding of the extent to                  which C02 greenhouse warming will be augmented by other                         atmospheric trace gases.",
