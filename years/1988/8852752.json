 "awd_abstract_narration": "The science department at this small, rural Community College is           introducing environmental science-related computer-interfaced                   instrumentation into relevant science course offerings in its Associate         degree programs.  The project serves primarily minority and                     underprivileged college students from the Upper Coastal Plain Region            of northeastern North Carolina, providing these individuals with an             unprecedented science exposure.                                                                                                                                      Computer-interfaced environmental science experimentation                  provides opportunities to make precise measurements of chemical and             physical processes relevant to environmental changes (e.g., climate,            air and water quality, water and soil pH, optimal plant growing                 conditions, etc.).  This project also provides capabilities for                 monitoring simultaneous experiments, storage and detailed analysis of           data, experimental simulations, and student design of experiments.              Finally, the revisions to the curriculum this project is making                 possible provide students with an exposure to science and to computer           applications in science, enhancing their long-term ability to perform           effectively in an advanced technological society.                                                                                                                    The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
