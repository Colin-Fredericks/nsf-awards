 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of approximately eight U.S.               scientists in an international workshop on laser applications in                surface science, coorganized by E. Ward Plummer of the University of            Pennsylvania, H.-J. Freund of Ruhr University, and Peter Andresen of            the Max Planck Institute in Gottingen.  The meeting will bring                  together about forty scientists with diverse backgrounds in surface             science, laser spectroscopy and dynamics, and nonlinear optics, to              share their expertise and insight in the applications of lasers to              surface science.  The role of theory in this newly developing field             will also be addressed.  Topics to be discussed include recent                  developments in laser technology, surface processes (e.g., energy               transfer, structural rearrangements, diffusion and chemical                     reactions), optical techniques, such as second harmonic generation,             at the macroscopic and microscopic levels, nonlinear surface                    processes and resonant phenomena at surfaces.  The meeting will                 combine general review talks with more detailed current research                presentations, through the use of discussion panels and conference              summary presentations by leaders in each area.  The goal is to                  review the state of the art and identify technical limitations,                 breakthroughs and future directions, while providing an environment             that will also encourage collaboration.                                                                                                                         The application of laser based techniques and technology to the                 investigation of surface phenomena holds tremendous potential.                  Characteristics of the laser open up new dimensions for the surface             scientist, while, for the laser spectroscopist, the study of                    surfaces offers a new challenge that is a natural extension of                  already well-developed studies on liquids, gasses, and solids.  A               broad spectrum of scientists and disciplines is needed in this new              interface of lasers and surface science.  The field is new enough               that there has not yet been a meeting such as the one proposed here,            where both laser and surface science experts from chemistry and                 physics have been brought together.  Funding from the Adriatico                 Conference will be used  to bring young scientists to the meeting to            encourage their participation in this important interdisciplinary               field.",
