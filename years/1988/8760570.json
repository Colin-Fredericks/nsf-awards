 "awd_abstract_narration": "Metal semiconductor sensors (MOS) would be ideal for ambient gas                monitoring if not for their nonlinearity and unselectivity.                     Fortunately, the response of a multisensor array can be                         computationally deconvolved enabling selective gas measurement.                 The proposed research extends this technique to real time                       applications by using networks of connected processors, or neural               networks.                                                                                                                                                       Phase I research will emulate multi-layer feed-forward neural                   networks, train them using back-propagation and use them to                     selectively measure ethyl alcohol, hydrogen, and methane with an                array of MOS sensors.  A goodness of fit output will also be                    incorporated and its efficacy for the detection of input channel                faults and phantom analytes will be evaluated.  Research results                should be broadly applicable to other problems of nonlinear                     multicomponent spectral deconvolution.                                                                                                                          Markets for lower cost gas detectors are dominated by foreign                   manufacturers.  By attacking the most significant obstacle to the               development of a new generation of cost-effective analytical                    instruments, this research should result in greater domestic                    competitiveness in this important field.",
