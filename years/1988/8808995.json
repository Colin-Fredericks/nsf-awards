 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project explores the development of neural networks for                     performing complicated computations in (a) collision avoidance                  under known, static working environments, and (b) manipulator                   dynamics, which is a mapping from joint positions, velocities and               accelerations to joint torques/forces.  For collision avoidance,                the detection of collisions is treated as a pattern recognition                 problem, which can be solved efficiently and easily by neural                   networks.  For computing manipulator dynamics, a three-layer                    neural network is being studied for mapping between continuous-                 valued input and output.                                                                                                                                        Collision avoidance and manipulator dynamics are very                           computationally intensive operations.  For real-time control                    usage, these computations must be accomplished in an acceptable                 time period, which is usually tens of milliseconds or less.                     Neural networks use massive parallelism, which allows these                     computations to be possible in real time.  The proposed research                represents a feasible approach towards these problems.",
