 "awd_abstract_narration": "New methods of evaluating the performance of acoustic materials                 especially at high sound levels are important if progress is to be              made in such fields as aircraft noise source reduction.  This project           develops analytical models and new experimental procedures for                  determining surface sound absorption and internal sound propagation             in a variety of common porous media at high sound pressure levels.              The project contains both a theoretical and an experimental phase.              In the experimental phase, an attempt is made herein to develop a               simple nonlinear theory which predicts sound propagation in air                 saturated perfectly rigid media at high intensity.  This theoretical            development is based on work initially done by Forchheimer and                  normally used to describe steady flows at high particle velocity                through porous media.  The theory is experimentally tested on a                 variety of porous materials including cellular, layered fine fiber,             and nonconsolidated granular materials all of varying porosity and              structural frame stiffness.  The results should be of great value to            engineers and scientists who deal with sound propagation and                    absorptions at high intensity levels in both commercial and military            applications.",
