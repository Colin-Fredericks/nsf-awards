 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this Research Equipment project, an advanced laser                           fluorescence apparatus will be developed to determine the surface               or translational diffusion coefficients of fluorescent-labeled                  probes in monomolecular films at air/water and oil/water                        interfaces.  This improved apparatus is based on a simple Moire                 technique for measuring surface diffusion using fluorescence                    recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) where the film is bleached                 in a periodic pattern.  This improved FRAP technique will avoid                 many of the problems associated with the radiotracer technique                  for measuring surface diffusion.  This new experimental technique               also will permit one to extend the study surface diffusion to                   interfacial systems previously inaccessible to study by the                     radiotracer method.  In addition, one will be able to separate                  between flow and diffusional transport processes occurring in                   monomolecular films.  The periodic pattern increases the spatial                resolution relative to the conventional single spot FRAP                        technique, resulting in more accurate diffusion constant                        determinations.                                                                                                                                                 This apparatus will be used to continue previous work on surface                diffusion in monomolecular films, in particular, to determine                   reliable values of the surface diffusion coefficient and its                    surface concentration and temperature dependence within various                 monolayer states in order to elucidate the nature of two-                       dimensional mass transfer at fluid/fluid interfaces.  The laser                 fluorescence apparatus also will be used in other research                      projects including monolayer structure, L-B films, bilayers, and                solid/liquid interfaces.",
