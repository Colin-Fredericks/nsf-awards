 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has been known for some time that factors which result in               stress can alter immune competency most probably via complex                    neuroendocrine mechanisms.  It is becoming increasingly evident                 that the two major integrative networks of the body ( the immune                and neuroendocrine systems) are inextricably linked, and that                   internal modulation of these systems is paramount to the                        organism's abilities to respond appropriately to external                       stimuli.  Drs. John McNulty and Gary Schneider are well versed in               the fields of immunology and circadian rhythms.  Their research                 is designed to test the hypothesis that the pineal gland, a part                of the brain, regulates immune functions, especially with respect               to chronobiological changes that occur over a 24-hour light:dark                cycle.  The pineal gland mediates various physiological effects                 of environmental lighting via the production of the hormone,                    melatonin, over a circadian cycle.  These researchers will also                 test the idea that the pineal gland is an important link in                     communications between the immune system and central nervous                    system.                                                                              Stress is an important phenomenon in our daily lives.  The                 research to be performed is attempting to understand the very                   basic biological mechanisms which occur due to environmental                    changes which stress an organism.  This work has far-reaching                   implications  with respect to basic mechanisms of homeostasis as                well as clinical applications.",
