 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between                          Professor Sow-Hsin Chen of the Massachusetts Institute                          of Technology, and Dr. Jose Teixeira of the                                     Laboratoire Leon-Brillouin of the Centre d'Etudes                               Nucleaires, Saclay, France.  The objective of this                              work is to study the microscopic structural and                                 dynamic properties of bulk supercooled water, which                             differ from those of normal water,  using techniques                            of thermal neutron and X-ray diffraction, and                                   quasi-elastic and inelastic neutron spectroscopy.  In                           addition, the dynamics of water in confined                                     geometries, as in the interior of reverse micelles and                          in certain types of molecules at low temperatures,                              will be studied.  In these systems, the interaction of                          the water with the proximate surfaces is important in                           understanding the folding and enzymatic activity of                             water and similar macromolecules. The study will also                           be extended to include other super-cooled liquids near                          their freezing or transition-to-glass temperatures.                                                                                                             The instruments for the high resolution neutron                                 spectroscopy measurements are available only in                                 France.  This research may have important applications                          in the fields of chemical reactions and cooling-system                          behavior.",
