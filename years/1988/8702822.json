 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this research is to search for photons                 from extraterrestrial point sources in our galaxy. The                          investigators from the University of Chicago will build a very                  large array of detectors (scintillators) at ground level                        distributed on a lattice covering an area of about 100,000                      square meters.  This detector array will surround the existing                  Fly's Eye cosmic ray device at Dugway, Utah.  The new ground                    level scintillator array will operate in coincidence with a                     second array of scintillators to be built by physicists from                    the University of Michigan.  The Michigan array will be buried                  about 10 feet underground where nearly all but cosmic ray muons                 are filtered out by the earth.  The presence of signals in the                  ground level array and the absence of muons in the underground                  array will be used to identify incident primary cosmic ray                      photons.                                                                             During the past few years, several groups reported                         evidence for the observation of extensive cosmic ray showers                    from point sources in our galaxy.  Also, the high muon content                  of these showers is larger than expected for incident photons.                  However, these works are of limited statistical significance.                   The new combined Chicago-Michigan detector will be a factor of                  five to ten times more sensitive than those used in previous                    investigations.  This new detector system is expected to                        resolve the questions of whether there are  cosmic ray                          particles with \"point like\" origins and whether such particles,                 if they exist, are photons or a new type of particle giving                     muon rich showers.                                                                   The research encompasses two fields of physics.  Namely,                   those of astrophysics and elementary particle physics.                          Astrophysics studies such questions as the origins and                          structure of the universe and elementary particle physics                       studies the basic building blocks of the universe and the                       forces between them.  These two fields are intimately connected                 to one another.  Also, the data is collected and analyzed using                 highly complex and sophisticated apparatus and techniques.",
