 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research project is to study the effects          of various entry configurations on local heat transfer and pressure             drop in tubes in the transition region.  This includes Reynolds                 numbers from about 200 up to 10,000, depending on the type of inlet             configuration.  Local heat transfer, pressure drop, and intermittency           factor measurements will be made near the entrance of a tube, with              those measurements continuing far enough downstream that fully-                 developed laminar or turbulent flow is achieved and the usually cited           correlations presumably become valid.  Various entrance configurations          will be tested.  Flow near the entrance of the tube will be modeled             using existing numerical techniques, and the results will be compared           to the experimental study.  Independent measurements of pressure drop           and velocity profiles in unheated transparent tubes and flow                    visualization studies will be used to assist in modeling the flow               phenomena.                                                                                                                                                      An enormous amount of data and analytical modeling is available for             fluid flow processes in tubes in the laminar and fully-turbulent flow           regimes.  However, very little has been done to examine the problems            in the transition flow regime encompassing Reynolds numbers from                perhaps 200 to 10,000.  In practical engineering design, the usual              recommendation is to avoid design and operation in this regime;                 however, this is not always feasible under design constraints.  Much            of the information available furthermore deals with the fully-                  developed flows far from the entrance, or involves entrance effects             downstream from highly idealized entrances.  The proposed research,             therefore, will provide a basic understanding and data in the spectrum          of tube flows, and also could have important practical design                   applications leading to improved design methods.",
