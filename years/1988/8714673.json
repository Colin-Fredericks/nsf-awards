 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carbonyl sulfide and carbon disulfide are two long.lived                sulfur gases that play an important role in the chemistry of the                stratosphere and the energy budget of the earth.  The magnitudes                of the various sources of these two gases are not well                          established but current analysis suggests that: 1) biotic and not               industrial sources appear to dominate the global carbonyl sulfide               and carbon disulfide inputs to the atmosphere; and 2) upland                    soils appear to be a major biotic source.  A large fraction of                  the upland soils of the world are covered by forests.  In the                   Northern Hemisphere, many of these forests are receiving high                   inputs of sulfur and nitrogen associated with acid rain.  It may                be suggested that there is a potential relationship between the                 magnitude of anthropogenic inputs of sulfur and nitrogen to                     forest ecosystems and the magnitude of carbonyl sulfide and                     carbon disulfide emitted from these systems.  The temperate and                 boreal forests that are under the influence of acid rain may be                 an important source of carbonyl sulfide and carbon disulfide to                 the atmosphere.                                                                         This project is concerned with measuring carbonyl sulfide               and carbon disulfide emissions from forest soils along an acid                  rain gradient in North America and to test the idea that the                    sulfur and nitrogen inputs to these forests in part control the                 carbonyl sulfide and carbon disulfide emissions.",
