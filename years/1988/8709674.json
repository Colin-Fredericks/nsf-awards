 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research examines the diffusion of information technology                  innovation in the newly emerging video text industry.  Existing                 theories of innovation and of industry organizations have not been very         useful for explaining the widespread collaborative relationship which           this kind of innovation appears to trigger.  This research focuses on           why firms do not develop innovations in house, imitate it or buy it             from those who license it, but rather team up with other firms who have         related but distinct technological expertise?                                                                                                                   Conventional economic approaches such as industrial organization theory         and transaction costs theory do not provide a satisfactory description          as to when and why firms would band together to exploit a new                   technology and how the innovations in products and services come about.         This research promises to break new ground by detailing the interplay           between the attributes of the technologies, the strategic technological         competence and distinctive skills of each firm and the new forms of             collaborative institutional arrangements and organization designs.",
