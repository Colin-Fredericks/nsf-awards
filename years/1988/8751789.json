 "awd_abstract_narration": "Basic Chemistry for Inadequately Prepared High School Chemistry Teachers        Through State-Wide Workshops will use a group of selected high school           and college teachers of general chemistry to design a workshop program          of instruction in basic chemistry for inadequately prepared high school         chemistry teachers.  During the first summer of operation (1988) a              prototype workshop will be held at which the workshop curriculum will be        class-tested and improved by the developers who also will serve as the          instructional staff.  This six-week program then will be offered at five        regional workshops at locations across Mississippi during the summer of         1989 (four of the workshops will be supported by NSF funds).  At each           workshop a team consisting of an experienced high school chemistry              teacher and a college teacher will instruct 20 particpants in basic             chemistry and effective teaching methods.  Laboratory teaching will             given special emphasis.  During the following academic year each                participant will be visited in his or her school by a workshop staff            member in an individualized  follow-up activity.  Group follow-up               meetings also will be held during the academic year.  Up to five more           regional workshops will be offered during the summer of 1990 (three             supported by NSF funds).  The program has been developed under the              auspices of the Mississippi section of the American Chemical Society            with the cooperation of faculty from several Mississippi university and         college campuses.",
