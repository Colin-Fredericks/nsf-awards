 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research will develop new reliability models of load testing that           use information on the performance of series-produced or similar                structures, success or failure in different test and service modes,             risk of test damage, load history of a structure, and other                     structural indicators such as stiffness and permanent deformation.              In the approach planned, a first estimate of strength or reliability            is combined statistically with new information from a load test or              other source, such as the observed performance of a related                     structure.  A revised estimate is obtained containing both new and              old performance information, that can be used in subsequent                     evaluation of the structure.  The quality of information, which                 varies from high, for actual proof tests of a structure in all                  important service modes, to low, for completely subjective                      evaluations of performance, will be reflected in model development.             The expected value of information to be gained from a test or non-              test alternative will be balanced against its cost (difficulty), and            against the performance of other competing options.  Current load               testing procedures will be reviewed and compared to model                       characteristics, and examples and case studies will be used to                  compare model performance in a variety of load testing                          applications.  The research will have an important impact on                    safety verification, risk management and maintainability of                     structures, screening of gross errors and deterioration, and many               other decision problems in structural engineering.",
