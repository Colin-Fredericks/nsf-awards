 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a five-day workshop involving eight                     teachers who have been selected and prepared to serve as                        \"support teachers\" in the Toledo public schools.  The eight                     teachers are divided into four two-person teams.  Each team                     consist of one science teacher and one mathematics teacher;                     four different schools are served, each by one team.  A                         support teacher is assigned a reduced classroom load and                        therefore has time to work with other teachers who are less                     well prepared.  The workshop is a small but essential part of                   a larger venture that was designed and conducted by the                         Institute for Research on Teaching (IRT) at Michigan State                      University in collaboration with the American Federation of                     Teachers and the Toledo Public Schools.  During an                              already-completed phase of the project, the eight teachers                      participated in 30 hours of professional development seminars                   conducted by IRT personnel.  This workshop, scheduled for                       August of 1988, will serve to solidify gains the teacher have                   made in knowledge and skills.  In the fall they will assume                     their new duties as support teachers in the Toledo schools.                                                                                                     This project will test a model for the preparation of support                   teachers and will assess whether the use of support teachers                    is and efficient mechanism for achieving improvements in the                    teaching of science and mathematics in the schools.",
