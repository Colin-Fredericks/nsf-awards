The research team from Northeastern University headed by          Dr. Geoffrey intends to continue the collaboration with the University          of Alexandria, Egypt team lead by Drs. Mohamed A. El-Sayed and Ahmed            El-Touky.  This collaborative effort has broadened the chemistry                discovery relating to the metal exchange in polynuclear materials.  The         proposed new work will build on the past effort in six important areas          including the building of larger and more diverse multi-metal molecules         at lower cost; the use of these molecules as sources of new metal               alloys and chemical catalysts to be used in still newer systems.                Development of the transmetalation phenomenon will lead to the                  establishment of new areas of study in organic and organometallic               chemistry.  The purpose of the Science in Developing Countries Program          is to advance the exchange of international scientific knowledge and to         contribute to the scientific infrastructure of developing countries.            This proposal meets those criteria.                                                                                                                             Scope:  These international collaborators are in the process of                 developing new approaches to handling metals that can very possibly             lead to new and unexpected products of unique and useful                        characteristics for use in both the laboratory and in the public                sector.  An additional pay-off of this research is the provision of a           wealth of learning opportunities for students pursuing degrees in               organic chemistry.  A final value of this research is the advance of            the scientific and technical knowledge of the research teams and their          impact within their separate universities.  The collaborative work of           these scientists from Northeastern and Alexandria universities has              resulted already in significant scientific advances and a number of             joint publications in major refereed journals.",
