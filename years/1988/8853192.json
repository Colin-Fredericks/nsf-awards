 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most of the students who enroll in the Histology course and its            associated laboratory are biology majors with plans to pursue graduate          degrees or to attend professional schools.  Historically, the                   laboratory part of this course included the study of prepared slides of         various tissue types and organ systems, as well as the routine                  procedures for the histological and histochemical staining of paraffin-         embedded tissues.  The laboratory experience then culminated in a               project which utilized some of the techniques learned in the course and         was presented in a poster format.                                                                                                                                    Redesigning this course to improve laboratory study at the                 cellular biology level -- fluorescence microscopy, ultrastructural              studies, immunohistochemistry, and plastic embedding -- provides                biology majors as well as biochemistry majors with a strong                     morphological background at the cell level for their advanced molecular         and biochemical courses.  This improved course retains the study of             basic tissue types, organ system histology, and the completion of a             project.  To make room for these proposed newer cell biology/histology          techniques, a careful culling of prepared slides was required.                  Previously, the histology course provided a large number of students            with the impetus to pursue independent study projects.  By expanding            the exposure of more students to a wider variety of techniques, this            program stimulates even greater interest in pursuing cell biology- or           histology-related projects.                                                                                                                                          The grantee institution is matching the NSF awarded with an equal          sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
