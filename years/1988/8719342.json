 "awd_abstract_narration": "The sage grouse is one of the more popular game birds in the                    western United States and a major spectacle viewed by thousands                 of the public each spring.  Its management is one of the                        important duties of state fish and game departments.  Dr. Gibson                and his colleagues have conducted basic research that has                       provided a number of tools useful in this management.                                                                                                           These useful findings have emerged from research using the sage                 grouse as a model system to examine theoretical questions about                 the mechanisms that determine biased mating success.  Males of                  lek-mating species exhibit conspicuous behaviors that attract                   females and thereby secure reproductive opportunities for the                   males.  Female sage grouse choose a mate from a group (or lek) of               communally displaying males.                                                                                                                                    This study will investigate experimentally the role played by the               vocal courtship display of male sage grouse.  The effects of                    vocal signals on female choice will be studied in the field by                  temporarily muting certain males and comparing their subsequent                 mating success with that of males that have not been muted.  The                study will test hypotheses derived from previous observational                  studies of this species.  The results will be directly relevant                 to the wider issue of the role played by female mating                          preferences in the evolution of courtship behavior.",
