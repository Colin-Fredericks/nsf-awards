 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry provides                     support for the research of Dr. Richard Johnson, University of                  New Hampshire. The work is focused on the mechanisms of                         selected photochemical (light-induced) reactions of organic                     compounds.  Such reactions are important in the visual process                  and form the basis of numerous industrial applications.                                                                                                         Several fundamental problems will be studied.  The first                        concerns a class of molecules known as cumulenes, which contain                 multiple pi bonds.  Specific goals include detailed mechanistic                 studies of known reactions, investigation of the potential for                  synthesis of new and complex structures, and exploratory                        experiments with new types of cumulenes.  A second emphasis is                  on asymmetric photoreactions, that is those which generate or                   modify chirality in organic compounds.  Experiments to study                    chirality in energy transfer, reactions of chiral biaryls, and                  applications of circularly polarized light will be carried out.                 In addition, ab initio quantum mechanical methods will be                       applied to the study of transient intermediates in photchemical                 reactions.  One specific investigation concerns trans-benzene,                  a new C6H6 isomer, which may be the key to much of the poorly                   understood photochemistry of benzene.",
