The program will utilize the expertise of the volunteer accountants,            bankers, and stockbrokers in the local community to work with teachers          to develop lessons for the classroom which provide practical math               applications and real life skills to students.  Two new units --                \"Project Bookkeeping\" and \"Project Stockmarket\" -- will be developed to         complement \"Project Banking\", a previously developed unit which will            also be revised as dictated by classroom experience.  Completed                 materials will be made available for use throughout the Cupertino               district and information about the program will be disseminated through         county education offices and the State Chamber of Commerce.                                                                                                     Cost sharing by the school district and private sector people and               organizations will equal 70% of the NSF funding.",
