 "awd_abstract_narration": "Terrestrial animals must continually support their bodies against               the force of gravity which restricts the range of locomotion                    methods used by these animals.  In contrast, fish live in an                    environment which buoys up the body, so that locomotor effort can               be focussed on moving through the environment.  As a result                     aquatic animals, and especially fish, move using a wider                        diversity of methods than their terrestrial relatives.                          Nevertheless, certain body and fin forms allow for more effective               use of some locomotor methods compared to others, and, as a                     corollary, affects the habitat in which fishes live and their                   behavior.  Most work to date has examined how fish form, function               and habitat interrelate for fish living in open water                           environments.  In practice, fish usually occupy, and indeed                     prefer, habitats including structures, especially surfaces such                 as the water bed, sides and weeds.  This area of fish biology has               been neglected, a situation that the proposed research seeks to                 rectify.  Theoretical models show that the distance separating an               animal or its propulsor from the ground is most important in                    determining the effect of a surface on the system.  The research                will systematically determine how different shapes of the body                  and of propulsors of fish affect the performance of typical                     species near and distant from horizontal surfaces (representing                 the bottom) and vertical surfaces (representing sides, weeds                    beds, and branching corals).  The result will provide a                         comprehensive descriptive mechanical model for fish interactions                with rigid surfaces which will be used to understand and                        interpret distributions of fish in different habitats and                       microhabitats.                                                                                                                                                  In addition to obtaining fundamental new knowledge on fish                      biology, it is  essential to recognize that modern animal                       management, including fish and aquatic habitats, seeks to base                  its practices on first principles population and community                      structure models.  The proposed research addresses the latter.                  Therefore, the research is expected to contribute to a variety of               applications.  For example, the research is expected to provide                 design principles for physical structures that would attract                    different types of fish, refining the design of artificial reefs,               rehabilitation or protection of shoreline development, and                      selection of sites for underwater parks.  In addition, the                      research will show how surfaces affect performance of bethic                    fish.  Studies such as these have contributed to the design of                  fishing gear, and the research is anticipated to suggest novel                  designs for gear selective for fish species based on form.",
