 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry                        Program supports fundamental studies at the interface between                   inorganic chemistry and solid state physics which deals with                    the intriguing question of when does metallic behavior take                     over from molecular behavior.  This research in the chemistry                   and physics of metal clusters will eventually lead to the                       discovery of materials with unusual physical or chemical                        properties.                                                                                                                                                     The project is to study the stereochemical systematics of a                     novel series of high nuclearity Au-Ag clusters.  The structures                 of these bimetallic clusters are based on vertex-sharing of                     centered icosahedral cluster units as building blocks which can                 be referred to as \"clusters of clusters\".  Metal clusters                       corresponding to the magic numbers 13, 25, 36, 46, 56, 76, and                  127 can be obtained by condensation of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 12                 centered icosahedral cluster units, thereby providing a                         reasonable pathway to clusters of increasing nuclearity.  It is                 hoped that investigations of these large metal clusters of                      discrete size and shape will shed light on the fundamental                      question of when, where, and how the metallic character begins                  and ends, as well as lead to new materials with unusual                         physical and chemical properties.",
