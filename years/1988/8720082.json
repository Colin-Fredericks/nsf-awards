 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. John Law and his colleagues at the University of Arizona will          establish a Biological Research Center for Insect Science (CIS).                The CIS will aim research at 1) discovering new aspects of insect               biology that will aid in the design of biorational methods for                  controlling insects; 2) development of model systems using insects that         will yield fundamental knowledge useful in the study of mammalian               systems; and 3) searching for new useful products and processes from            insects.  Programs will include research, training, education and               outreach, with a strong emphasis on molecularly-oriented                        interdisciplinary research. The CIS will sponsor meetings and symposia          in insect science, and have strong international linkages.  An                  industrial associates program will facilitate technology transfer.              Individual projects will include research on insect: cuticle structure          and function, digestion and nutrition, proteins and hormones, endocrine         systems, reproductive systems and central nervous systems.  Other               studies will focus on molecular, sensory, behavioral and ecological             factors in insect-plant interactions; insect communication and                  behavior; insecticide action; caste differentiation in social insects;          and insect population biology, systematics and evolution.  Through the          results of its research and training programs, the CIS should have a            worldwide impact on fundamental and applied biology.                                 Insects share co-dominance of the biosphere with humans.  The              relationship ranges from competitive to cooperative, as they compete            for resources, carry disease, pollinate plants, and process organic             wastes.  The importance of understanding insect biology was brought out         as some chemical pesticides were abandoned for social and environmental         concerns, and as the effectiveness of others decreased when resistant           strains developed.  In fact, much of our knowledge of insects derives           from studies of one organism, the common fruit fly Drosophila, which            has been exploited for decades in the study of genetics and animal              development.  The remarkable new experimental tools provided by recent          advances in biochemistry and molecular biology now allow new approaches         to the study of fundamental aspects of the biology of many other                insects.  Besides contributing to the development of new agents and             strategies for pest control, such studies should provide a wealth of            information on genetics, social behavior, animal development, and               nervous system function.  To this end, the CIS will provide                     multidisciplinary research and education programs on insect science.            This center will be built on a strong base of existing faculty and will         coordinate with an existing Biotechnology Center to expand                      collaborative efforts in basic research, to train present and future            scientists, and, in collaboration with industry, to probe the potential         uses of insects in applied research.",
