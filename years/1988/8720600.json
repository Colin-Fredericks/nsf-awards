 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent experimental and theoretical work on the violations of                   Bell's inequalities suggests that we are now at a watershed in                  quantum theory.  In spite of this common perception, there is no                clear consensus on the question of what our understanding of the                issues really amounts to, nor what questions remain to be                       answered.  In particular, there are two important tendencies                    which increasingly occur in the literature:  (i) to claim                       that violations of inequalities need no explanation; or (ii)                    much remains to be explained though there is disagreement about                 what sort of explanation might be appropriate.  Dr. Stairs                      supports an explanatory approach involving the notion of quantum                holism.  Regardless of which position one takes, Dr. Stairs has                 found that both approaches give rise to a curious puzzle.                       Jarrett's decomposition theorem shows that the locality condition               used in deriving the inequalities consists of two independent                   components:  \"physical locality,\" which forbids faster than light               signalling; and \"completeness\" or \"factorizability,\"  which                     requires stochastic independence of outcomes.  It is generally                  agreed that violations of physical locality would call for                      explanation in a way that violations of factorizability may not.                But both options (i) and (ii) seem unable to respect this                       distinction.  With support from this grant, Dr. Stairs will                     articulate this puzzle and investigate the issues to which it                   gives rise.  His aim is the further articulation and defence of                 holism as a tool for understanding quantum mechanics.",
