 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to interest twenty 11th and 12th grade high         school students in pursuing laboratory science careers. Students will           be placed in research laboratories during the summer under the                  direction of research scientists in the Colleges of Biological                  Sciences, Mathematical and Physical Sciences and Medicine at Ohio State         University.  In this ten-week program students will have the                    opportunity for hands-on laboratory experience, will attend lectures on         scientific ethics, will be counselled on career opportunities in the            sciences and their own skills on the laboratory sciences, They will             also be given opportunities to explain to others what they have learned         and what they may have added to scientific knowledge.  Parents and high         school teachers will be invited to participate with the students in the         program.  It is expected that students' research experiences and their          interactions with faculty, graduate students and other researchers will         increase their interest and enthusiasm for science.",
