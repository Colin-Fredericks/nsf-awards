 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program is in the area of organometallic chemistry.                   The project is concerned with expanding the chemistry of and                    gaining further insights into the properties of selected                        transition metal carbonyl and boron metal carbonyl cluster                      systems. Of particular interest is the chemistry of these metal                 cluster compounds on surfaces, where they serve as catalysts                    for the interconversion of organic compounds and as models of                   surface-supported metal clusters, which constitute another                      important class of heterogeneous industrial catalysts.                                                                                                          The synthetic effort of the project is designed to provide                      several new heteronuclear cluster materials which contain                       triangular or higher polyhedral cores of mixed metals, or                       metals plus a main group element such as boron. Chemistry of                    the formation of triosmiumnonacarbonyl clusters containing BCO                  or B3O3 groups will be studied to gain insights into the                        reaction pathways by which they and some of their derivatives                   are formed. The surface organometallic chemistry of a number of                 these mixed metal and metal boron clusters will be examined on                  hydroxylated magnesia and conversion to heteroatomic metal                      clusters will be attempted. In principle, a study of such                       particles can provide interesting correlations and basic                        understanding of highly dispersed heteroatomic catalysts and of                 the influence of one type of atom on the catalytic properties                   of the other. Some modelling of clusters on oxide surfaces will                 be attempted also.",
