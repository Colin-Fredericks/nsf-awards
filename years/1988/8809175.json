 "awd_abstract_narration": "Perhaps the most common problem in engineering design involving                 soils, is the problem of calculating the movements that result from             application of general states of stress to the soils.  Until the last           ten to twenty years, it was feasible to calculate either the very               small movements that resulted from small loads (compared to the load            that causes collapse), or to calculate collapse loads and assume that           movements were so large that it became unnecess- ary to calculate               them.  For common cases in which neither extreme was valid, it was              necessary to apply \"engineering judgement.\"  With the advent of                 modern digital computers, researchers are engaged in a two-pronged              attack on this class of problem.  One mode involves attempts to                 measure generalized soil properties (complete state of strain in                response to a generalized state of applied stress) and development of           models to describe the soil response.  The second mode involves                 development of numerical methods so the resulting soil properties can           be used to predict mass movements in the field.  This proposal                  involves the first mode.                                                        The goal of this research is to perform reliable measurements of the            response of samples of clean sands to complex states of stress, and             then to fit appropriate models to allow analytic description of the             resulting properties.  The socalled hollow-cylinder device will be              used to measure properties.  A variety of constitutive models will be           tried.  Both monotonic loading (load                                            directly to failure) and cyclic loading (repeated application of                stresses less than the failure stresses) will be used.",
