 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are being furnished for the purpose of upgrading the              computational instrumentation of the Inter.university Consortium                for Political and Social Research.  The goals are to improve the                functional capacity of the consortium as a facility for research                and instruction in the social sciences; to improve its capacity                 to provide services in a more effective fashion; and to prepare                 it to capitalize on advances in computer and information                        technology as such advances occur and are deemed applicable.                            Through this effort, inflationary and other pressures to                increase membership fees will be eased, and consequently the                    number of colleges and universities able to subscribe to the                    consortium will continue to include the less well.to.do and more                geographically remote along with the large, more centrally                      positioned institutions.  The overall effect will be to maintain                and perhaps even increase the number of social scientists with                  access to the consortium, and to open new windows of opportunity                for exploitation of the consortium's vast data holdings .. thus                 serving to expand and sharpen our understanding of societal                     processes.                                                                              The consortium is an organization with over 320 college and             university affiliates.  It acts as a repository for and                         distributor of computer.readable data amenable to social                        scientific analysis. Such data include, but are not limited to,                 data collected under NSF grants that are deemed useful for                      secondary analysis (the consortium is the preferred repository                  under the Division of Social and Economic Science's new archiving               policy), and public use data files placed under consortium                      distributorship by federal statistical agencies.  Data from a                   great many other sources also form part of the consortium's                     multifaceted archives.                                                                  Through the work of the consortium, technical and economic              obstacles to data use and data sharing are substantially reduced,               the use of data is effectively democratized, the utility of                     costly data collections is increased, and greater research and                  instructional \"payoff\" is gained.  Perhaps even greater benefits                accrue from the value of the consortium as a resource for                       scientific verification and replication, and from its intrinsic                 character as a provider of quantitative information on social                   phenomena from more than one perspective.                                               The recommended award will furnish the funds needed to                  replace obsolete computer equipment and capitalize upon emerging                technologies in such areas as optical scanning, optical storage,                and data transmission.  Other approaches to storing,                            transmitting, and otherwise accessing archived data (CD ROM and                 LAN, for example) will be explored and utilized in accordance                   with the judgment of experts.",
