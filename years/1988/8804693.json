 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports international scientists and graduate                  students to participate in a University of Pennsylvania Earth                   System Science Workshop on \"The Global Water Cycle:  Past,                      Present, and Future\".  The nature of the global water cycle and                 its role in global change has been singled out as a major problem               area critical to an understanding of planetary change.  The                     scientific approaches in this workshop involve atmospheric                      moisture transport and precipitation models, transfer between                   major reservoirs, the role of the hydrologic cycle in climate,                  the role of water in the world ecosystem, the water cycle coupled               to biogeochemical cycles, hydroclimates of geologic history and                 associated phenomena, societal issues and a changing water cycle                and the hydrologic cycle and future global change.                                   Workshops in Earth System Science sponsored by the Earth                   System Science Center are directed to foster multidisciplinary                  interaction in the study of major problems in the sciences of the               earth.                                                                               This workshop is important because it treats broadly, the                  processes that control our planet's water cycle.  This is a                     fundamental scientific problem that must be better understood in                order to advance our knowledge of the earth's climate and its                   variability.",
