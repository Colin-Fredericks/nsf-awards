 "awd_abstract_narration": "The technology and application of novel passive and active fiber optic          devices will be investigated.  Research in passive devices will build           upon the recent discovery that dielectric mirrors can be produced in a          continuous length of silica fiber by fusion splicing.  The                      interdiffusion process which occurs when the mirrors are produced will          be studied for a variety of candidate materials.  Multilayer films              will be used to obtain high reflectance.  Novel input-output couplers           and in-line polarizers will be produced using angled mirrors.  Fabry-           Perot interferometers in single-mode fiber will be explored for                 application as temperature and strain sensors.  Feedback from fiber             mirrors will be used for diode laser frequency stabilization, line              narrowing and mode locking.                                                                                                                                     Acoustooptic phase modulators in which the fiber itself serves as a             cylindrical acoustic resonator will also be investigated.  A zinc               oxide transducer on the fiber surface will be driven from an rf signal          source to produce a standing acoustic wave which modulates the guided           light via the strain-optic effect.  A coherent communication                    demonstration will be carried out using these modulators.",
