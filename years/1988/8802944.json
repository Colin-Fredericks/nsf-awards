 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Engineering Research Equipment Grant will provide funds for a              picosecond laser system (Nd:Yag, mode-locked, Q-switched 1.06um with            second harmonic 0.53um capability 35ps pulses).  The main objective is          to expand the current NSF funded project on nonlinear processes in              liquid crystals into the relatively unexplored picosecond regime where          several new fundamental wave mixing processes of important applied              potentials have been developed recently.  Specially, theory and                 experiment have shown substantial beam amplication can be realized in           any highly nonlinear Kerr media by two-wave interaction, owing to the           generation of higher order diffracted waves.  The effect has been               experimentally demonstrated from the cw to the nanosecond regime in             liquid crystals, organic polymers and semiconductors.  Cavity-less              optical logic gates and opto-optical modulation effects have also been          recently demonstrated with nanosecond laser pulse.  The picosecond              laser system will enable study for the first time of the dynamics of            these wave mixing processes, and the roles played by various                    semiconductor and organic material physical parameters such as                  recombinations, diffusions, excitonic formations, molecular                     orientations, corrections inter- and intra-band transitions, molecular          sizes, electronic hyperpolarizability, etc.  Several fundamental                important effects and new nonlinear optical devices principals could            emerge from this study.",
