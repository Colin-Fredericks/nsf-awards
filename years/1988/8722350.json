 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to characterize the properties of                  crystals doped with optically active ions and pumped by laser                   excitation.  The research can be divided into two thrust areas:                 characterizing the properties of long range energy migration                    among the doping ions and determining the rates of radiationless                transitions between excited electronic states.  The major                       experimental technique to be used in this work is four-wave                     mixing (FWM) spectroscopy.  For the energy transfer studies this                will be supplemented by time-resolved site-selection (TRSS)                     spectroscopy measurements, and for the radiationless decay                      studies this will be supplemented by picosecond pulse-probe                     measurements and by accumulated photon-echo measurements.  The                  experiments will be performed on several chromium doped crystals                that are important for laser applications.  By correlating the                  information obtained in both of these areas, it will be possible                to begin developing a detailed understanding of the spectral                    dynamics of optically pumped laser materials.  By comparing the                 results obtained on each of the materials investigated, it will                 be possible to relate these characteristics to the properties of                the host crystal.  The knowledge gained from this type of                       detailed, systematic study is important to the continued                        development of laser and electro-optic technology.",
