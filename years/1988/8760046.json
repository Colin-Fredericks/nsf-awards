 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cold weather protective clothing of today consists primarily of many            thin layers of insulating material.  It would be far more desirable if          cold weather protective clothing could release useful amounts of heat           for periods of time during which the wearer's body was unable to                provide sufficient heat to maintain body temperature.  This approach is         similar in concept to the use of phase change materials to store solar          energy.                                                                                                                                                         The research explores the feasibility of producing fabrics which can            store thermal energy through phase changes.                                                                                                                     If successful, this research would identify a new type of fabric for            cold weather garments.  These garments would be thinner than                    conventional garments, thereby allowing the wearer to work comfortably          under cold weather conditions.  Markets for this fabric include outdoor         winter sportswear and winter emergency shelters and blankets.",
