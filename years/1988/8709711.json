 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous studies have led to the definition of a category                  of idiotope designated regulatory idiotopes which have been                     proposed to play an important role in idiotype-determined                       regulation of the immune response.  High connectivity between B                 cell clones with various antigen specificities has been                         demonstrated, and such clones can be activated by antibodies                    specific for regulatory idiotopes.  This phenomenon has been                    termed \"cross-regulation\".  Furthermore, the majority of                        monoclonal antibodies expressing A48 regulatory idiotopes                       utilized V genes derived from the VH441-4 and VK10 families.                    Further studies will be aimed at exploiting these observations to               gain further insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms                 governing the expression of regulatory idiotopes.  A rabbit                     antibody specific for a synthetic peptide corresponding to CDR1                 of the heavy chain of A48 antibody and hybridomas from non-                     immunized mice selected with a VH441 germline gene probe have                   been prepared.  The antibody to the synthetic peptide will be                   used to determine whether or not the antibodies sharing                         regulatory idiotopes express the same CDR1 sequence as the                      germline gene from which the A48 protein is derived.  The                       antibodies produced by the hybridomas selected from non-immunized               mice (\"steady state\") will be characterized with respect to their               VH and VK families, their idiotypy, and their fine specificities.               This should make it possible to determine the frequency of                      regulatory idiotopes in the steady state.  The sequence of VH and               VK genes encoding antibodies expressing regulatory idiotopes will               be carried out and should enhance our understanding of the                      molecular factors contributing to the expression of regulatory                  idiotopes.                                                                          The overall goal of these studies is to elucidate                           the immunochemical and molecular basis of regulatory iditopes.                  This knowledge should add to our understanding of the mechanisms                by which immune responses are regulated.",
