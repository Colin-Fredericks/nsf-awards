 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sophomore and upper level biology majors, while grounded in the            facts of biology, routinely are grossly lacking in an understanding and         appreciation of the overall significance of experimental laboratory             results.  This project addresses this deficiency by establishing a new          cell biology laboratory using microscopic techniques exclusively for            the elucidation of  (1) cell and tissue structure,  (2) localization            and structure of tubulin and microtubules, and  (3) the localization            and structure of mitochondria and succinic dehydrogenase.  These are            being accomplished using histological procedures, bright field                  microscopy, semithin sectioning, transmission electron microscopy,              indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, phase contrast microscopy, and          cytochemistry of frozen sections at the light microscope level.                                                                                                      The following major equipment is being purchased in order to               establish this laboratory:  ultramicrotome, fluorescent microscopes,            cryostat and student microscopes.  The investigations are being carried         out and then used by students as a basis for elucidating the                    limitations of biological techniques and the incomplete nature of               experimental results.  Equally significant, this new laboratory                 provides first-hand, detailed learning of a variety of modern, up-to-           date, microscopical techniques.  This cell biology course is populated          by pre-health professionals, by health professionals who are continuing         their education and training, by prospective high school biology                teachers, and by a sizeable group of majors.                                                                                                                         The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
