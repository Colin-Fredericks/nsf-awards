 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of young labor economists in Western Europe are                   currently applying modern econometric techniques developed in the               U.S. for studying the effect of taxation on labor supply.                       They have been extending these techniques to introduce additional               features such as life-cycle behavior and labor market                           constraints. At the same time, interest has grown in Western                    Europe and the United States in tax reform. The conference to be                funded by the present award will take advantage of this surge of                research and policy interest by drawing together economists from                most industrialized countries who are working on the relationship               between taxation and labor supply. The conference will center on                providing estimates for various countries from a common model,                  and providing a forum for innovative research aimed at extending                the model in different directions. The results of the conference                will be published in a special issue of an international journal.",
