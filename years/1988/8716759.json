 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable collaborative research between Professor                 Gregory Carmichael of the University of Iowa and Dr. Hiromasa Ueda              of the National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan over a               two-year period.  The transport, chemical, and removal processes                affecting long range transport of pollutants will be investigated               via a comprehensive field program in Japan and a detailed modeling              analysis.  The primary objective of the project is to understand                long range transport of pollutants in complex flow situations                   involving mountainous terrains and sea/land interactions.                                                                                                       Understanding of long range pollutant transport is increasingly                 important as the rate of industrialization increases worldwide.                 Information on pollutant transport gained in this study is to be                applied to complex flow situations in the U.S. and elsewhere.  The              data set being collected by the Japanese investigators is one of                the most comprehensive data bases of its kind, and includes both                detailed meteorological and chemical observations of pollutant                  transport.  Dr. Carmichael has extensive experience in modeling                 pollutant transport, chemical reactions and removal.  His                       diagnostic analysis of the empirical data set will be extremely                 useful for interpretation purposes.",
