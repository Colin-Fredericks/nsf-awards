 "awd_abstract_narration": "The adults of many species of Antarctic birds show morphological,               physiological and behavioral adaptations to their cold                          environment.  However, it is not known how adults and chicks have               adapted to enable successful chick survival and growth under                    Antarctic conditions.  The thermoregulatory problems facing                     nestling birds are tremendous due to their immature physiology,                 small size, poor insulation and lack of mobility.  The                          development of endothermy is a crucial event during the ontogeny                of young birds, and it profoundly impacts the energetics and                    reproduction of their parents.  Bennett will investigate whether                thermoregulation of young chicks is primarily influenced by                     behavior of adults and chicks or the physiological capacity of                  the developing young, using three charadriiform bird species                    (Kelp Gull, Antarctic Skua, and Greater Sheathbill).  These birds               independently colonized Antarctica and are hence ecologically                   convergent.  The Kelp Gull range extends to lower latitudes,                    enabling comparisons to be made both within and between species.                The relative energetic costs and survival implications of                       different behavioral strategies (including nest construction,                   foraging patterns and brooding behavior) and physiological                      adaptations (including resting and maximal oxygen consumption,                  conductance, shivering capacity, and enzymatic activity in                      skeletal muscles) will be assessed.  This study will form a                     critical part of a larger study of the evolution of development                 in charadriiform birds in response to ecological pressures.",
