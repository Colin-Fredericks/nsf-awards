 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Zoltan A. Schelly is supported by a grant from The                 Physical Chemistry Program to study the dynamics of reverse                     micelle formation in nonpolar solvents.  This research has                      technological importance in such industrial areas as catalysis,                 lubrication, corrosion prevention and biotechnology.                                                                                                               Reverse micelles are aggregates of surfactant molecules                      which may spontaneously and reversibly form in nonpolar                         solvents such as oils.  In contrast to normal micelles in                       aqueous solution, the polar head groups of the surfactant                       molecules comprise the core of reverse micelles, and the                        hydrophobic tails face the apolar solvent region.  The polar                    core contains some water, referred to as the \"pool\", which                      remains even after drying the components of the solution.                                                                                                          The current study addresses the dynamics of reverse micelle                  formation.  Questions which are being addressed include: 1) How                 fast and by what sequence of elementary processes are reversed                  micelles formed? 2) What is the average lifetime of surfactant                  molecules in the aggregates? 3) How does the pool size affect                   the above processes? and 4) How does the rate process                           contribute to the stability of the aggregates?                                                                                                                     The experimental techniques employed in this study are                       electric field-jump and laser-induced birefrigence with real                    time computer data acquisition and analysis.",
