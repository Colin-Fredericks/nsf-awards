 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optical interconnecting elements can potentially act as a powerful              alternative to electrical wiring, because photons lack the interactive          nature of electrons.  As a result, photonic interconnections offer              minimal signal deterioration, immunity to parasitic (capacitive or              inductive) loading, and insensitivity to EMI, amongst other                     advantages.  Current optical interconnects are based primarily on               optical fibers, on planar configurations of the thin-film holographic           type or on optical spatial light modulators which can perform matrix-           vector or matrix-matrix multiplications.  However, the interconnection          capacity of schemes using thin holograms is restricted by the area of           the hologram and the operating efficiency is limited by the narrow              interaction region of the film thickness.  On the other hand, optical           interconnection systems based on spatial light modulators are                   complicated and bulky.                                                          The work projected here is a theoretical and experimental                       investigation of a recently proposed three-dimensional class of                 photonic interconnections utilizing photorefractive crystals.  These            novel configurations are based on volume (rather than planar)                   holographic geometries.  Their operation involves a composite Bragg-            reflection mechanism provided by a large multiplicity of holographic            gratings; the gratings are generated inside the volume by the optical           inputs themselves according to a prescribed interconnection pattern.",
