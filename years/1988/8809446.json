 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study involves a network analysis of the world economy, looking            specifically at the international system of trade among nations.  The           topic of the world system -- the structure of the world-economy and how         it changes or remains stable -- is a central theoretical concept for            those doing research at the international level.  Another important             theoretical construct is that of \"unequal exchange\" of commodities.             This project uses the technical advances of network methodology to              examine the network of exchanges within the world system, focusing              specifically on the unequal exchange in trade among nations, the                direction and nature of these exchanges, and how these change over              time. By combining time-series data on international trade reaching             back as far as 1938 with innovations in network methodology, the study          will be able to evaluate hypotheses about changes in both the overall           structure of the world system and the specific roles which particular           nations play in it. The implications of these patterns of trade for             various measures of economic growth, political stability and social             development within countries will also be assessed. Two principal data          sources will be used: the Commodity Trade Statistics, and the United            Nation's Direction of International Trade.                                                                                                                      Trade between nations is a topic that can only be addressed at a                global, world-system level.  To understand the commodity exchanges              between any two nations requires information about their patterns of            exchange with other trading partners.  Hence the importance of network          analysis, which enables the researcher to take into account all of the          trade linkages among nations.  Knowledge of this structure of                   international trade, and the roles certain nations play in commodity            exchanges at various points in time, is crucial to arrive at an                 understanding of a wide array of social, political, and economic                changes within particular societies and across nations.",
