 "awd_abstract_narration": "Productivity of temperate forests typically is limited by                       nitrogen supply Nitrogen cycling in forests is linked to regional               and global environmental issues, such as groundwater quality and                the trace gases composition of the atmosphere.  Forests are being               fertilized to stimulate forest growth to meet increasing demands                for forest products, and are being used as \"living filters\" to                  remove nitrogen from applied wastewater.  Extensive forested                    areas are receiving excessive additions of nitrogen through                     nitrogenous components of acid rain.  Although general patterns                 of nitrogen cycling in unimpacted forests are known, little is                  known about the nitrogen accumulation potential of forests, or                  the ability of forests to handle chronic excess nitrogen                        additions.                                                                                                                                                      This research is first of all a comparative ecosystem study of                  the effects of excess nitrogen additions on nitrogen cycling in                 early, mid- and late-successional forests on Cape Cod,                          Massachusetts.  Secondly, this study will take advantage of a                   natural experiment inadvertently set up by the Town of Falmouth,                in which 24 hectares of forests and successional vegetation are                 scheduled to be irrigated with wastewater highly enriched with                  15N, a stable isotope of nitrogen.  The presence of this 15N                    label will enable isotopic analyses to be used to trace the fate                of the wastewater nitrogen added to the Cape Code forests.  The                 research at the Falmouth site began in 1985, when the wastewater                treatment plant was still under construction.  In the elapsed 2.5               years a baseline study of nitrogen cycling in the forests has                   been completed.  It is expected that research results will be of                fundamental ecological importance and applicable to the treatment               and use of municipal wastes.",
