 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will study how people learn to classify objects and               how categories are represented in memory.  The research will be                 guided by the continued development and testing of a mathematical               model, the exemplar model, formalizing the view that                            classification decisions are based on similarity comparisons                    between presented objects and stored exemplars.  The research                   will involve the study of performance relations between                         categorization and other choice tasks people are often asked to                 perform, including identification and recognition.  In the                      categorization task, people classify items into groups; in the                  identification task, each item is assigned a unique response; in                the recognition task, people simply judge whether items are old                 or new.  The exemplar model and another class of model, rule-                   based classification models, make different predictions about the               relationships among results of experiments involving the three                  choice tasks.  Therefore, the experiments should help to                        distinguish between these two kinds of theories.  Theoretical                   research accompanying the experimentation will be aimed at                      elucidating the nature of stimulus bias and asymmetric similarity               relations.                                                                                                                                                      The process of categorization is among the most fundamental of                  mental activities.  It allows people to bring order and                         organization to their environment, and it is a building block of                more complex cognitive activities such as reasoning, thinking,                  and problem solving.  A clear understanding of the nature of                    categorization processes will be instrumental in advancing our                  understanding of human thought.",
