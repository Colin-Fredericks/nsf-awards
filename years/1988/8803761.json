 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research examines late-Quaternary sediments on the                     Southern High Plains for information on past environments.  A                   number of dry valleys (draws) cross the region and have slowly                  filled with sediments for the past +11,000 years.  Previous                     scattered geomorphic investigations strongly suggest synchroneity               in late Quaternary depositional and soil-forming events and                     similar regional environmental changes.  The first objective of                 the research is to document the late Quaternary stratigraphic                   histories of the draws to test the hypothesis of synchronous,                   regional geomorphic and soil-forming events.  Another objective is              to understand environmental and hydrologic changes at the end of                the Pleistocene.  There are marked out-of-phase hydrologic changes              from flowing to standing water along and among the draws between                11,000 and 10,000 yrs. B.P.  It is unclear whether these                        variations are due to local geomorphic conditions or environmental              differences.  The third objective is aimed at understanding middle              Holocene environments.  There appears to have been regional,                    massive eolian deposition at this time, suggestive of severe                    widespread aridity.  The proposed research will help establish the              late Quaternary paleoenvironmental record for a vast region (over               120,000 km), hitherto known only from a few sites.  The record                  appears to be one of dramatic environmental changes, which is                   clearly the case for historic times.  Understanding these past                  changes could help in dealing with future climatic extremes.",
