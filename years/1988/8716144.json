 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support the continuation of the analysis of data                obtained from auroral x-ray detectors that were flown on a series               of balloons that were flown from the South Pole Station,                        Antarctica during the austral summer of 1985-86.  The experiment                was done in conjunction with the University of Houston.                                                                                                         The x-rays that were detected were produced by energetic electrons              that were precipitated into the upper atmosphere from the                       magnetosphere.  The data will be analyzed in conjunction with                   electric field data measured on the same balloons by the                        University of Houston group as well as with data from a number of               ground based instruments such as the University of Maryland                     riometers, the Bell Labs and University of New Hampshire                        magnetometers and the conjugate radars at Goose Bay, Labrador and               Sondrestrom, Greenland.  In addition the data will be compared                  with the available spacecraft data to determine the conditions                  under which energetic auroral electron precipitation occurs.                                                                                                    The University of Maryland and the proposers are well equipped to               carry out this research.",
