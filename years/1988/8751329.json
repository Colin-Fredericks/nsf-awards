Beginning in January 1988, primary                 leaders will attend ten sessions of training, developing a                      handbook and workshops. In the summer of 1988, school districts                 will nominate a team of three elementary science teachers and an                administrator, who will attend a four week workshop in biology,                 earth science, chemistry and physics at UCLA with lectures by                   scientists on the staff of the University. The primary leaders                  will run the workshops and perfect the handbook. In the 1988-89                 academic year, the school districts will arrange workshops for                  their science teachers using the secondary leaders.",
