 "awd_abstract_narration": "Direct observations of the atmosphere through immersion and             remote sensing are necessary for advancements in the atmospheric                sciences.  Instrumented research aircraft have been invaluable in               providing these observations over the last four decades.  The                   need for such aircraft will be great over the next few years for                research covering a broad range of research problems including                  atmospheric chemistry, mesoscale meteorology and cloud physics                  which have been identified as high priority research areas in the               atmospheric sciences.                                                                   This award will make available to the entire atmospheric                sciences community the University of Wyoming King Air research                  aircraft.  The Wyoming King Air will be treated as all other                    atmospheric sciences community facilities with allocation being                 made by a peer review process.  The University of Wyoming                       personnel have much experience in airborne research and the King                Air is a state.of.the.art research platform.  This award also                   will help in maintaining an active program in airborne research                 at the University of Wyoming which over the last few years has                  produced many of the scientists in this area.",
