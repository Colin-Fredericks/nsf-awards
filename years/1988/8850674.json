 "awd_abstract_narration": "The strategy underlying this project is called \"near peer\" counseling           and mentoring. The American Indian Science and Engineering Society              (AISES) is establishing a networking model to improve the access of             American Indian students to careers in science and technology. The              model, cooperatively developed with Montana State University, Northern          Arizona University, Clarkson University, the University of New Mexico           and New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology will be implemented           over a two year period. AISES student chapters at those institutions            are the major vehicle in implementing the network and conducting the            activities. One of the major accomplishments of AISES has been in               sponsoring the establishment of undergraduate student chapters at some          40 colleges and universities around the country. These have played an           important role in improving the retention rate of American Indian               undergraduate students on those campuses.                                       Project activities during the first year involve mentoring, role                modeling, motivating and encouraging American Indian high school                students through science and mathematics activities conducted by                selected members of each chapter. After appropriate preparation and             training by faculty during the first semester, these chapter members            make regular second semester visits, initially accompanied by their             chapter faculty sponsor, to five predominantly American Indian high             schools in the region. They conduct special labs, lead field trips, and         hold counseling sessions for students as well as special sessions for           parents, teachers, extended family, tribal leaders and school board             members. The Indian high school students and their parents are also             invited to visit the AISES campus chapters to sit in on university              classes and witness a typical day in the life of an American Indian             student majoring in science or engineering.                                     During the second year, following a similar schedule, new AISES                 chapter counselors will be trained and will then repeat the previous            year's activities with a new group of high schools and students. At the         same time, selected members of the high school students impacted the            first year will be trained as counselors for similar activities in              elementary and junior high schools serving American Indian students. A          computerized tracking system linking AISES, the participating                   universities and AISES chapters, and the schools into a network for             monitoring and evaluation will be established.",
