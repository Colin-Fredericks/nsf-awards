 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental goal of community ecology is to derive an understanding           of environmental processes (both biological and physical) which                 influence the dynamics of populations in a community.  In McMurdo               Sound, Antarctica, benthic community assemblages have strong east-west          and north-south density gradients.  These assemblages are apparently            related to gradients in primary production.  The objective of this              research is to explain how productivity gradients are functionally              linked to the benthic system.  The study will examine the relative              importance of in situ production and advection in influencing                   community structure. The team of investigators will examine benthic             microbial and meiofaunal trophic relationships, ecology of protozoans           and meiofauna, and in situ benthic production. Studies of the                   macrofauna will focus on recruitment, growth and survivorship.  The             physical component will be directed to regional circulation and local           current patterns.  This integrated approach will provide information            on how the physical regime affects the benthic biological community.",
