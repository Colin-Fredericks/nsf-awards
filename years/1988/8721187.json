Interpretation              of these deposits and their stratification is controversial.  The               PI proposes to build a combined flow duct to simulate various flow              environments, and to study the resulting bedform configurations                 and stratifications over a wide range of oscillation periods,                   oscillation velocities, and super-imposed currents.  These will                 then advance the knowledge of ancient deposits and the flow                     regimes responsible for them.   After the bulk of experimental                  runs are completed, an advisory body of twelve experts on                       oscillatory flow have agreed to meet at MIT for a week to examine               and discuss the results, and remake key flow duct runs.  They will              also discuss implications for interpretation, and plan further                  work.",
