 "awd_abstract_narration": "To improve the scope and relevance of high school chemistry, physics,           and biology laboratory instruction, a centralized pool of portable              instruments will be established and experiments developed suitable for          use with these instruments.  These will be made available to high               schools in the area around Canisius College, which will serve as the            permanent home for the equipment pool.  Cooperating industrial                  laboratories will offer teachers both short-term supporting hands-on            laboratory training and full-time summer employment in their facilities.        The portable equipment is being donated by industry and the college.            Summer teacher enhancement programs emphasizing effective integration of        the instrumental experiments into high school curricula will be offered         by the college.                                                                                                                                                 Cost sharing by the college and industrial firms will equal 79% of the          NSF funding.",
