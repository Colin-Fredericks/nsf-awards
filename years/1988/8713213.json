The project is part                 of the UNIDATA (University Data) program, a community initiative                designed to help universities employ modern computing and                       networking technologies to access, analyze and display                          atmospheric and related data.  Under a previous grant, the                      Principal Investigator was successful in creating several compact               discs which are undergoing initial testing in the community.  The               major activity under this award will be the development of the                  necessary interfaces with the UNIDATA Local Data Management                     System so that compact discs can be used on a variety of local                  computer systems.                                                                    This project is important to atmospheric scientists who                    routinely deal with voluminous data sets in their research.  The                compact disc technology offers the potential for as an                          inexpensive, reliable, and efficient means of data access.",
