 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed study involves both a detailed systematic                  revision of the crinoids from the late Osagean (Mississippian)                  Keokuk Limestone and the basal part of the Warsaw Formation in                  Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri, and a study of their depositional                 settings.  Crinoids from the Keokuk and basal Warsaw have not                   received study in the latter half of this century, despite the                  fact that crinoids of this age in other areas are well                          understood, and these faunas are from the North American                        Standard Section of the Mississippian.  Re.evaluation of these                  faunas will complete our understanding of the systematics,                      community paleoecology, and depositional occurrences of crinoid                 faunas from the late Osagean throughout the east.central United                 States.  This in turn will enable us to interpret the                           constraints and controlling factors that were responsible for                   the distribution of late Osagean crinoids.  We will test these                  new data against the environmental controls model, which is                     based on multivariate analysis of late Osagean crinoid faunas                   from the Borden deltaic complex in Indiana and Kentucky.                                Documentation of controlling factors operating on late                  Osagean crinoids is essential for a fundamental understanding                   of Paleozoic crinoids.  The Osagean was witness to the maximum                  diversity known among crinoids, and yet at the close of the                     Osagean, crinoids suffered extreme extinction.  Crinoid faunas                  after the terminal Osagean extinction were very different in                    taxonomic character and remained basically the same from the                    recovery following the extinction event until the terminal                      Paleozoic mass extinction.  Results from the proposed study are                 prerequisite for posing larger questions on the evolution of                    Paleozoic crinoids.",
