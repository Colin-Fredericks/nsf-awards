 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through a Lawrence Hall sponsored partnership, 151 high school teachers         from 35 school districts in the San Francisco Bay area have had summer          jobs in 40 industrial firms.  From these experiences these science,             mathematics, and computer science teachers have carried a broader               understanding of the applications of modern science and mathematics back        into their classroom teaching.  In 1986 an Industry Initiatives for             Science and Mathematics Education Academy of Fellows was established to         promote further exploitation of their industrial experience in Bay area         classrooms.  Through this project the Academy teachers will develop and         test instructional materials based on their summer assignments in               industry which they can use themselves and share with other teachers,           explore ways to form an electronic network between themselves, and              provide seminars which will carry university credit. The summer                 experiences in industry have already proven valuable, but this project          will explore ways to enhance the value of such work experiences further         through this variety of continuing activities.                                                                                                                  Cost sharing by the partners will total 75% of the NSF funding.",
