 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proper development of eukaryotic organisms requires differential                expression of a multitude of genes with precise timing and tissue               selectivity.  Dr. Singleton is utilizing the developmental                      program of the cellular slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum, as                a system to investigate the molecular details of differential                   gene expression and the developmental regulation of this                        expression.  He has identified and characterized three groups of                genes which show various forms of differential expression upon                  the onset of development or shortly thereafter.  Two groups are                 deactivated upon initiation of development, and the mechanisms of               the deactivation events are very different between the two                      groups.  A third set of genes is induced as development begins                  and is transiently expressed during the first few hours of the                  program.  Dr. Singleton's analysis of mutant strains unable to                  develop has led to subclassification of the genes into those that               appear to be under the same regulatory system.  He will continue                to isolate the genomic clones corresponding to certain of these                 genes and utilize them to investigate the molecular events                      involved in their regulation.  The sequences necessary for                      transcription and proper regulation will be defined, and the                    protein factors which mediate the regulatory events will be                     identified and characterized.  A system for generating and                      identifying mutations present in the genes encoding the                         regulatory machinery will be developed. Finally, through                        mutagenesis of a selected gene, he will begin to address what                   role these genes play in the establishment of the developmental                 program.                                                                        %%%                                                                             These investigations should result in a more comprehensive                      picture of the complexity and the details of the regulatory                     events leading to the activation and establishment of development               using a simple model system. They will provide significant                      insight into the molecular machinery that is utilized in the                    control processes of early development.",
