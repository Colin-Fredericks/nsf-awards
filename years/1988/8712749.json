 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between                          Professor Roger L. Hooke, University of Minnesota, St.                          Paul, and Professor Wibjorn Karlen, University of                               Stockholm.  This research will contribute to an                                 on-going investigation of processes that occur at the                           interface of glaciers and their underlying layer.  The                          variations in time and space of the coupling between                            the glacier and this layer, particularly as reflected                           in water pressure effects on sliding velocity, will be                          studied on the Storglacier in northern Sweden.  Prof.                           Hooke and his Swedish collaborators have been involved                          with studies of the Storglacier for the past six                                years.  This work will extend previous measurements of                          surface velocities, winter snow accumulation,                                   ablation, and borehole deformation, by adding                                   measurements of surface tilt and strain, water                                  pressure variations in boreholes, internal drainage,                            and sediment and water discharge at the glacier                                 terminus.   Correlation of all of these studies will                            lead to an enhanced understanding of the dynamics of                            glacial flow.                                                                                                                                                   The University of Stockholm's Tarfala Research                                  Station, the base for these studies, is located near                            the glacier, and provides excellent facilities for the                          recording and analysis of the data to be obtained.                              The proposed cooperation presents the U.S.                                      investigator with an opportunity to use highly                                  specialized facilities, immediately adjacent to the                             subject of his experiments.   Studies of glacier                                dynamics are of increasing importance, as land                                  utilization extends closer to valley glaciers in                                mid-latitude regions.  These studies are also                                   necessary to understand the effect of future expected                           sea-level rises on glaciers.",
