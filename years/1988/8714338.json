 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theory of nonlinear wave equations has long played a                   prominent role in physics and applied mathematics, for instance                 in theories of gases and liquids, in the theory of elementary                   particles, and in cosmology.  Their mathematical study goes back                to Riemann, but methods of analysis were not sufficiently                       developed for a systematic study until the 1960's.  In this                     decade there were several major breakthroughs, including the                    beginnings of theories of global existence, blow up, solitons,                  scattering, the inverse scattering method, and shock waves.  The                subject has continued to undergo rapid change.  Major                           developments in the 1980's have included the study of important                 special systems like the Minkowski-Yang-Mills equations and the                 Vlasov-Maxwell equations, the development of a stability theory                 of solitary waves, and general results on solutions of small                    amplitude and on the propagation of weak singularities.  This                   conference will be devoted to nonlinear wave equations.  Walter                 A. Strauss, one of the principal architects of the subject, will                be the main speaker and will deliver a series of ten lectures.",
