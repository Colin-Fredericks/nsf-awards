 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mitochondrial biogenesis requires the coordinate expression of                  their nuclear and mitochondrial genomes.  The long term goal of                 this research is to understand the nature of the controlling                    signals in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae that synchronize the                    production of mitochondrial proteins encoded in the separate                    compartments.  The characterization of nuclear respiratory                      deficient pet mutants has identified several genes necessary                    for processing of mitochondrial precursor transcripts and                       translation of the resultant mRNAs on mitochondrial ribosomes.                  One group of pet mutants describes the nuclear gene CBP1, which                 encodes a 76,500 dalton protein that is imported into the                       organelle and interacts with the 5' end of the cytochrome b                     precursor RNA.  It is planned to purify the CBP1 protein and                    study the interaction with substrate RNA in vitro.  The CBP1                    gene produces two polyA+ mRNAs, differing at the 3' end by 900                  nucleotides.   How and why the abundance of the RNAs is                         regulated by glucose repression will be investigated.  A coding                 sequence terminates in the TATAA box for CBP1.  This upstream                   gene is expressed as a 1.1 kb mRNA that is also under                           catabolite control.  Deletions of this gene lead to a phenotype                 similar to deletion of a mitochondrial outer membrane protein                   gene.   The sequence of the gene, will be determined.  Does                     transcription of this gene affect expression of CBP1 and                        define how does the encoded protein function in the cell.                                                                                                       At the present time we have only a sketchy understanding of how                 the functional integrity of subcellular organelles is                           maintained and modulated in response to a changing environment.                 In yeast the production of mitochondrial respiratory-chain                      components are significantly altered by changing their growth                   conditions.  As three of the large enzyme complexes of the                      inner mitochondrine membrane are composed of subunits encoded                   both on nuclear chromosomes and on the organella genome, the                    change of expression due to media availability must be                          coordinated.  Is it transcriptional or translational factors                    that enhance and decrease production of nuclearly encoded                       respiratory chain components?   The answer to this question is                  of great importance for an understanding of mitochondrial                       respiration.",
