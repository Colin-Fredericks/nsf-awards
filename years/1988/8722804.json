 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of electron paramagnetic resonance                (EPR) spectroscopy.  Professor Gareth Eaton of the University of                Denver and Professors Sandra Eaton and Martin Maltempo of the                   University of Colorado at Denver are working collaboratively to                 develop EPR imaging as a viable tool for the determination of the               three-dimensional distribution of radicals in various materials.                This technique would also enable the determination of the full                  hyperfine spectrum of the radical at each point in space, for                   nonuniform distributions of radicals.  The current effort of these              investigators builds upon the initial instrumentation development               work in this area by Gareth and Sandra Eaton which was supported                under NSF grant CHE-8421281.  The successful development of EPR                 imaging would allow the non-invasive, three-dimensional                         characterization of paramagnetic centers, both metallic and non-                metallic, in a broad array of materials including those of                      biological interest.                                                                                                                                            Unlike its now well-developed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)                  analogue, EPR imaging suffers from inherently broad resonances,                 which necessitate very strong magnetic field gradients, as well as              generally quite dilute concentrations of radicals.  Countering                  this is the magnitude of the electron spin moment and,                          correspondingly, a signal-to-noise ratio which is significantly                 more favorable than that encountered in NMR.  During the tenure of              NSF grant CHE-8421281, the instrumentation necessary for the                    proof-of-concept testing of EPR imaging was developed.  The                     primary thrust of the current research is the development of the                software with which the three-dimensional EPR image is                          reconstructed from the from the acquired spectra and subsequently               presented;  also the breadth of application of this technique will              be ascertained.  This research award should permit a critical                   assessment of potential impact of this analytical technology.",
