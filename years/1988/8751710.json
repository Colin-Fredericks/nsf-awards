Laboratory                         activities, computer applications including simulations, the                    bioethics of the use of this technology, actual teaching                        strategies for this current topic and the development of a set of 25            lessons will be the objectives of this program.                                                                                                                 These teachers will conduct inservice sessions for their fellow                 teachers based on these activities and the materials developed,                 present workshops at professional meetings and are encouraged to                write articles for professional science teaching journals.                                                                                                      The Iowa State University and the school districts from which the               participants will be selected have cost-shared close to 20% of                  the cost of the project, in addition to the University supporting the           establishment of the Iowa Biotechnology Center for                              Instruction.",
