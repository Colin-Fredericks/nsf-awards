 "awd_abstract_narration": "In fiberoptics communication systems, detectors are one of                 the major components.  Currently, Ge and GaInAs p-i-n and                       avalanche photodiodes (APD) are the major detectors for this                    application.  However, an APD with comparable avalanche gain                    and noise figure to a Si APD is still not available.  HgCdTe,                   because of its controllable low doping, high multiplication                     gain of over 50, and a high k value (8-12 in contrast of 0.3-2                  for Ge and GaInAs), is potentially one of the promising                         materials for making high performance APD.  Phase I of this                     program  investigated the feasibility of using liquid phase                     epitaxy (LPE) and metal-organic chemical vapor deposition                       (MOCVD) methods to produce conventional APD and staircase APD.                  The results, especially the conventional APD produced by LPE,                   exceeded the program expectation.  The characteristics of these                 APD are not only much better than those recently reported on                    HgCdTe APD made by other methods, but are also comparable or                    better than those reported on Ge and GaInAs APD.  However,                      before the HgCdTe APD is used commercially, a number of                         potential problems have to be solved.  Therefore, in this Phase                 II program, it is proposed to solve these problems and to                       produce a prototype high quality HgCdTe APD for commercial                      application.  The specific goals include (1) Achieving a low                    series resistance, (2) Reliability test, (3) Increasing the                     bandgap of the window layer, (4) Forming a guard ring                           structure, and (5) Analyzing other device structures.                                This research addresses the conversion of light beam                       information into useable electrical signals.  This conversion                   is central to lightwave communication systems.  Not only is it                  important to do this with good efficiency, but it must also be                  done with as little noise as it possible.  This particular                      research will exploit the demonstrated characteristics of a                     particular material in which to make such electrical convertors                 or \"detectors\" with characteristics superior to those available                 from other materials.",
