 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large ice particles play a central role in the physics of                  clouds and precipitation, especially in deep convective clouds.                 Two processes are important for the formation of large ice                      particles, namely, the clumping and riming processes.  The                      clumping processes produces snow aggregates which may serve as                  the embryos of graupel and hails.  The graupel and hails then                   grow by riming and recycling through dry and wet growth stages.                 In the riming process, latent heat will be released which may                   influence the cloud dynamics.  The impacts of these processes                   depend very much on the ice particle growth rates.                              Unfortunately, our previous understanding of the ice growth                     process is mostly qualitative.  The main difficulty lies in the                 facts that ice particles have complicated shapes and thus                       complicated hudrodynamical behavior and that the motions are                    unsteady.                                                                            Under this grant, Professor Wang will use the cloud tunnel                 at the University of California, Los Angles to conduct                          experiments of ice crystal aggregation, and also carry out                      theoretical computations of ice crystal motion in air.  Professor               Wang is competent and well qualified to carry out the work.",
