 "awd_abstract_narration": "Graduate student Paul Kemp proposes to study the                           relationship between tissue and shell growth in gastropods, using               a combination of shell morphometrics, computer modelling and                    controlled growth experiments.  Based on his published                          undergraduate thesis, Kemp hypothesizes that variations in the                  growth rate of body tissue has a profound effect on the both the                thickness and coiling geometry of the snail's shell.  In that                   study, Kemp found striking shell differences within a species                   that differed principally in food supply.   He proposes to raise                populations at varying levels of food and calcium in the                        substrate.                                                                           The project has broad implications not only for systematic                 practices among gastropod workers, but for the integration of                   biological and morphometric studies.  Systematists will gain new                insight into the direct effects of environemntal conditions on                  those characteristics often used to distinguish species.                             Paul Kemp is a quadriplegic.  The proposal requests a                      specially modified microcomputer-based image analysis system.                   This award will support a valuable dissertation research project,               allow Mr. Kemp to pursue a career in research, and aid in the                   design and development of research equipment for spine-injured                  scientists.",
