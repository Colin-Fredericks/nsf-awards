The contractor will produce detailed statistical tables                         displaying survey results.                                                           As part of its requirement under the National Science                      Foundation Act, as amended, to provide a central clearinghouse                  for the collection, interpretation and analysis of data on the                  current and projected availability of scientific and                            technical resources in the United States, NSF collects and                      disseminates statistical data on detailed characteristics of                    industrial R&D spending and employment of scientists and                        engineers.  The data collected in this survey are published as                  tables and used in analytical reports; they provide policy                      makers with a broad range of statistical information for                        industrial research and development spending and employment.",
