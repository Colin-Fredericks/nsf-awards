 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of the proposed conference are to review the                     recent developments in the neurobiology of arachidonic acid (AA)                and its metabolic products, including protaglandins, thromboxanes               and leukotrienes, in relation to their formation, mode of action                and functions in the nervous system.  The role of these compounds               in the development of certain neurological and possibly                         psychiatric disorders will also be discussed.  Such a conference                on basic and clinical research issues related to AA and its                     derivatives in the nervous system should fill a gap between the                 extensively researched field of eicosanoids formation and                       function in physiological systems other than the nervous system                 and the rapidly developing fields of basic research on signal                   transduction, modulation of neuronal functions and clinical                     research on cerebral ischemia, brain injury, convulsive disorders               and other neurological or psychiatric disorders.  The proposed                  conference is inherently interdisciplinary in approach as the                   major areas of discussion concern the biochemical physiological                 and pathological aspects of AA and its metabolites in the nervous               system.  As much of the basic research on the formation and                     effects of AA and its metabolites in the nervous system has been                conducted with animals, a major aim of the conference is to                     bridge between researchers whose primary interest is in the                     clinical care of humans and those working with animal models.  It               is expected that this conference will bring together researchers                with divergent backgrounds in the biochemical, neurosciences and                clinical fields who have interest in both animal and human                      research.  The following topics will be discussed;  Modulation of               AA release and metabolism in the nervous system; The AA cascade                 in the nervous system; AA and its metabolites in signal                         transduction; Cerebral blood flow and AA metabolism in relation                 to brain injury and ischemic damage; AA metabolism and convulsive               disorders; and finally, AA and its metabolites in normal and                    abnormal brain functions; and Relationship to pain, sleep and                   mental  disorders.",
