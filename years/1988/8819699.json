 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will try to map out the potential for artificial neural           networks (ANNs) in the fields of robotics and systems control.                  Robotics and systems control are among the most important possible              applications of ANNs, for two reasons.  First, they are of enormous             economic significance; higher levels of factory automation are                  essential to higher levels of productivity in the American economy,             as well as such areas as military and space applications.  The largest          potential applications of ANNs in these areas will not be possible for          many years, because a lot of very fundamental research will be needed           first; this workshop will try to map out what is needed.   Second, the          difficulties of ANNs in controlling robots are similar to the                   difficulties faced by organic brains in controlling movement to                 achieve goals over time; it is hoped that a better understanding of             the former will lead to a better understanding of the latter.  This             workshop will attempt to bring together a number of scattered research          groups doing work which is important to these areas, and produce a              report on future directions which can guide NSF and stimulate good              proposals in this field.",
