 "awd_abstract_narration": "Semiconductor optoelectronics is becoming increasingly important in             science and engineering.  It is therefore highly desirable that                 engineers and scientists should be introduced to optoelectronics.  Much         of the relevant material can and should be incorporated in                      undergraduate curricula.                                                                                                                                        The Center for High Technology Materials at the University of New               Mexico, in partnership with Sandia National Laboratories, will conduct          a two-week workshop in semiconductor optoelectronics for undergraduate          teaching faculty in university physics and engineering departments.             The workshop will include lectures, laboratory tours/demonstrations,            and hands-on laboratory sessions in epitaxy of III-V direct-gap                 semiconductors, fabrication, processing and characterization of                 optoelectronic devices such as semiconductor injection lasers, and              applications such as optical fiber communications.                                                                                                              This project aims to facilitate the inclusion of semiconductor                  optoelectronics in undergraduate physics and engineering by developing          within faculty a basic knowledge and appreciation of the subject,               providing direct contact with some of the latest experimental and               theoretical advances, and by establishing an ongoing and mutually               beneficial interaction between undergraduate faculty and a national             center of excellence in the field.                                                                                                                              In addition to the NSF funds, participants' institutions will                   contribute about 10% in travel costs toward the operation of the                project.",
