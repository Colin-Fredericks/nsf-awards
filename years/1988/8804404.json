Students will be expected to master at least a part of a large                  task and at the end of the summer will give short seminars on                   their work.  Half the students will come from the University of                 Colorado and half from other colleges and universities in                       Colorado and contiguous states.  Special efforts will be made                   to solicit applications from minorities.                                             This project is supported under the Program of Research                    Experiences for Undergraduates to help ensure an adequate                       supply of scientists for the future.",
