 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Darlington Herbarium is the second oldest institutional                herbarium in the U.S.  It contains 20,000 specimens, mainly from                1828-1855.  Many of the specimens are vouchers from works of                    noted botanists of that period, a time of national expansion and                exploration.  Currently, the wealth of information contained in                 this collection is largely inaccessible because of cataloging,                  synonymy, and bookkeeping problems.  An estimated 90% of the                    specimens have not been annotated in the past 100 years and are                 filed under their original taxonomic names.                                          This project will provide two years of funding to repair,                  number and update the taxonomic nomenclature of the specimens.                  With the technical help of a graduate assistant, updated                        nomenclature and label information will be computerized to allow                easy and efficient access to the specimens.  Once computerized,                 specimens can be sorted by collector, current taxonomic name or                 synonyms, geographical area, location in the collection, etc.                   The award will also provide equipment to improve the housing of                 the collection and its use by professionals.  The goal is to                    preserve, modernize and publicize this valuable and often-                      overlooked historic and taxonomic collection.",
