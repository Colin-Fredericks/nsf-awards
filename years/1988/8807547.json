Dr. Van Degrift will collaborate with members of the group             of Dr. Katsunori Shida in a study of corrections to the quantum                 Hall effect that depend upon such phenomena as electron                         concentration in heterostructures, and the size of experimental                 samples.  The quantum Hall effect, which occurs in certain                      materials at low temperatures and high magnetic fields, causes                  semiconductors to exhibit a quantized magnetically induced                      resistance, the value of which can be used to determine certain                 physical constants.                                                                                                                                             Dr. Van Degrift has extensive experience with the quantum Hall                  effect, and its application to fundamental measurements, at the                 National Bureau of Standards.  Working at ETL, he would be able to              take advantage of ETL's own experience, as well as their extensive              facilities for the fabrication of test devices.  Close cooperation              between researchers of ETL and of NBS, both organizations                       responsible for the maintenance of measurements standards in their              respective countries, would be mutally beneficial.",
