 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematics of the University of Florida                 will host the 1988 Spring Topology Conference.  The Department of               Mathematics of the University of Tennessee will host the 1989                   Spring Topology Conference.  These will be the 22nd and 23rd                    annual conferences, respectively, in a series of conferences held               at various universities.  Over the years, many important areas of               topology have been well-represented at these conferences.  Last                 year for the first time, dynamical systems was integrated into                  the conference.  There was much interest and interaction among                  participants, and in fact, several people from the traditional                  group gave talks relating to dynamical systems.  The conference                 will merge the two groups again in 1988.  It will again run for                 three full days in order to accommodate additional talks.  Most                 of the speakers will come from the traditional group.  Some                     survey talks by well-known researchers will be given as well as                 talks on interesting new results.                                                    The focus in 1988 will be on two special areas:  (1) group                 actions, including the Hilbert-Smith Conjecture (a p-adic group                 cannot act on a manifold), and (2) dynamical systems, including                 complex dynamics.  There will be a survey talk on each of these                 topics.  A third area with invited talks is the application of                  topology to chemistry, especially the application of knot theory                to the behavior of DNA.  In 1988, there will also be two or more                Problem Sessions on various topics, including one on each of the                above topics.  Problem Session Leaders will be responsible for                  writing up the discussion and problems for publication in                       \"Topology Proceedings\".",
