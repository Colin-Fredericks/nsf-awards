Major efforts are concentrated on two systems                        projects, the MAGNET network testbed, and a Lightwave Network                   project, which serve as focal points for a broad range of                       investigations and as testbeds for new ideas.  A                                prototype fiber-optic network has been developed and its                        operation has been demonstrated at the unprecedented speed of                   12.5 GHz.  A concept for a metropolitan area network is being                   explored with several industry partners.  Innovations are being                 pursued in semiconductor materials processing, including advances               in laser-assisted chemical etching.  Exciting progress has been                 made in implementing \"micro-area networks\" involving optical                    interconnections among integrated circuit chips. These activities               will continue and will converge on the concept of intelligent                   distributed optical networks.  This action is a five-year                       renewal.",
