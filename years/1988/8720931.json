 "awd_abstract_narration": "The birth, growth, decline, and death of business establishments                is a prominent, pervasive feature of market economies.  The                     specialization of labor resources is another prominent feature of               market economies.  Taken together, these two observations point to the          importance of the continuous reallocation of labor.  Despite these              features of market economies, the role of establishment-labor demand            disturbances in the secular and cyclical behavior of the labor market           remains unexplored.  In this regard, one key issue is whether                   fluctuations in intrasectoral labor reallocation driven by                      establishment-level labor demand disturbances explain large movements           in sectoral and aggregate unemployment rates.  A second key issue is            whether the concentration of employment losses across establishments            within a declining sector plays an important role in the behavior of            unemployment.                                                                                                                                                   The purpose of this project is to investigate these two key issues by           combining unemployment data from the Current Population Survey with the         newly-created Longitudinal Establishment Datafile (LED) for                     manufacturing industries.  The LED file provides longitudinal data for          individual establishments in U.S. manufacturing industries from 1972 to         1983, a period that encompasses three recessions, two major oil price           shocks, dramatic shifts in the labor force shares and employment levels         of many manufacturing industries, and dramatic movements in                     unemployment rates.  The matched data set well provide researchers              investigating a variety of questions about market behavior.",
