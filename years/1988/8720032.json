 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under this proposal, we intend to study the physical                    properties of ocean bottom sediments and their relationship to                  the processes by which they were formed and evolved.  The                       properties of these sediments will be mostly obtained from                      measurements made down the wells drilled during cruises of the                  Ocean Drilling Program.  If possible, we will also make direct                  laboratory measurements on any actual samples of these sediments                recovered during drilling.  This proposal involves three specific               work tasks:  1) Analyze existing data sets collected during the                 Ocean Drilling Program and the previous Deep Sea Drilling Project               and collect further data in future ODP cruises.  These data                     sets will be analyzed to obtained the shear wave velocity of the                sediments.  2) Refine our method of obtaining shear wave velocity               of the sediments from the full waveform acoustic logging data                   collected.  This involves increasing the speed and accuracy of                  our calculations, better signal processing techniques to reduce                 noise in the data, and improvements in the model of sound wave                  propagations in these sediments.  3) Study these sediments in the               laboratory, whenever it is possible to do so.  These studies will               involve inspecting the samples under a high power Scanning                      Electron Microscope to find out their structure and composition,                making direct measurements of shear wave velocity and other                     physical properties, comparing them to measurements made in                     the well, examining how these data fit into existing theories                   about the formation and evolution of these sediments, and, if                   necessary, developing new theory about these processes.",
