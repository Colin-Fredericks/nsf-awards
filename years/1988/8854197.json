 "awd_abstract_narration": "The program will enhance the knowledge and instructional                   skills of forty-eight faculty members in the field of                           manufacturing engineering.  These members will come from colleges               and universities primarily in the midwest.  Institutions are                    striving to establish undergraduate programs in manufacturing                   engineering but are severely handicapped by the shortage of                     qualified instructors.  The shortage can be alleviated by                       upgrading existing faculty.                                                                                                                                          The program comprises four sessions, with intervals of days                to weeks to allow for preparatory work.  Topic outlines for the                 sessions are as follows:  Session I:  Clinic and Instruction in                 Manufacturing Engineering.  Program overview.  Identification and               analysis of instructional problems.  Frameworks for organizing                  instruction in manufacturing engineering.  Manufacturing                        operations.  Kinds of manufacturing engineers.  Five intensive                  short courses in the areas of time management, creativity and                   innovation, and personal networking.  Session II:  Productivity-                Related Projects.  Simultaneous engineering.  Part design for                   performance and producibility.  Part fabrication.  Applications                 of computers.  Preparation of a process specification manual.                   Cost reductions.  Research frontiers for the process selected.                  Human factors.  Three laboratory/plant tours.  Session III:                     Product Quality-Related Factors.  Ascertaining what customers                   want.  Design of products for quality.  Quantitative Ishakawa                   diagrams.  Taguchi methods.  Preparation of a product quality                   manual.  Modern nondestructive test methods.  Pilot run.  Two                   plant tours.  Session IV:  Design and Fabrication of                            Instructional Aids.  Workplace engineering.  Replacement theory.                Pros and cons of computers in manufacturing.  Manufacturing                     management.  Visit to the headquarters of the Society of                        Manufacturing Engineers.  Provision will be made for networking                 the participants by computer and by follow-on seminars held                     annually for three years.                                                                                                                                       In addition to the NSF funds, participants' institutions will                   contribute about 5% in travel costs to the operation of the                     project.",
