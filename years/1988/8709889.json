 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hot mantle material upwelling in a broad zone beneath active            ridge crests like the East Pacific Rise (EPR) melts to provide                  magmas feeding the narrow axial neovolcanic zone plus active                    near-axis seamounts.  Knowledge of the thermal structure, mantle                flow patterns, melt-generation sites, and conduit and storage                   geometry within the broad subaxial zone is important for                        understanding magma supply and tectonic processes at active ridge               crests.                                                                                 This study will complement on-going studies of EPR axial                processes by integrating the results of new seamount petrologic                 study in order to construct a fuller, more comprehensive picture                of the thermal structure and petrogenesis beneath the broad                     subaxial zone.  Active seamounts near the EPR axis occur at                     along-axis depth minima and offsets (OSCs and transforms).  The                 former type are well-studied and these studies provide several                  testable hypotheses for the interaction of axial and seamount                   petrogenetic processes.  In contrast, seamounts at offsets have                 received no systematic study.  Proposed in this study is a 30-day               seabeam/dredging program to survey and sample 25 seamounts (87                  dredges) in various tectonic settings at OSCs and transforms and                to complete a petrologic/geochemical study of the samples.                              The goals of this study are to chemically characterize the              lavas of seamounts at offsets and to use that data to test half a               dozen discrete hypotheses for the origin of seamounts at offsets,               mantle flow and melting processes, and magma supply geometry at                 depths beneath the EPR and its surroundings.  The petrogenetic                  interpretation of the seamount lavas will be combined with                      interpretations for the origin and evolution of coeval, EPR axial               magmas to gain a broader understanding of petrogenetic-tectonic                 processes occurring beneath the EPR.  The study has been designed               to minimize potential problems of spatial/temporal correlation.",
