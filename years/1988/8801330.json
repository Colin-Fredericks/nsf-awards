The                  title of the Symposium is: The Assembly of the Nervous System.                  The goal of the Symposium is to more clearly identify the                       important problems in neural development that can benefit from                  application of newer molecular techniques, and by bringing                      together active researchers working on different levels of                      organization of the nervous system, to encourage new insights and               approaches to these problems. Speakers and attendees will be                    drawn from divergent disciplines.  The speakers, a mixture of                   established investigators and younger investigators, were chosen                first because they have made important contributions to their own               research specialty and second because they are effective in                     presenting their work in a broader context.                                         Progress is the areas of the role of genes in specific                      developmental neural processes and on understanding the cellular                mechanisms of processes unique to the nervous system have been                  substantial in the past few years and it is therefore valuable to               hold such a symposium to discuss and assess this progress.",
