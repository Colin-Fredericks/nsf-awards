 "awd_abstract_narration": "The acquisition of a recording Infrared Spectrophotometer is                    substantially improving the quality and quantity of organic chemistry           instruction.  Students majoring in the pre-professional programs in             chemistry, biology, environmental science and nutrition are having the          opportunity to gain first hand experience with IR spectroscopy, an              important tool in the modern organic chemistry laboratory.  The                 technique is enabling students to collect information about and                 describe the molecular structure of known and unknown organic                   compounds, to analyze mixtures of closely related compounds, to                 determine the purity of products from synthetic reactions, and to               detect, identify, and measure the concentration of short-lived                  intermediates.  By using IR spectroscopy, students are comprehending            more fully the importance of instruments at every stage of structure            determination, from isolation and purification to final comparison with         an authentic sample, and are becoming familiar with equipment that is           normally encountered by sophomores in four-year colleges.  The students         are being better prepared for transfer to the four year schools.                                                                                                The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.",
