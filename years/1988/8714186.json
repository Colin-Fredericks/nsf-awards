 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Professor Bruce Balick of the University of              Washington to collaborate with Professor Vincent Icke of the                    University of Leiden, The Netherlands, in a study of planetary                  nebulae, which are hot, ionized clouds of gas associated with the               final stages of stellar life.  Their collaboration will involve                 obtaining improved observational descriptions of planetary nebulae              and developing improved models to explain the causes of the intricate           and symmetrical shapes of the nebulae.  Professor Balick has an                 extensive observational data base on planetary nebulae and he has               experience in testing model predictions by detailed observations.               Professor Icke is an expert in theoretical nebular hydrodynamics, and           has developed a very sophisticated computer simulation program that             has been successfully adapted for modelling other stellar objects               such as supernovae remnants.  Collaboration with Dr. Balick will                facilitate access to a U.S. supercomputer to run the complex programs           needed to model nebular dynamics.                                                                                                                               Planetary nebulae are gaseous shells ejected by aging stars.  The               ejection is thought to occur in two stages, first as a rather slow              \"wind\" containing the outer layers of the star (over a period of                thousands of years), then a much faster expulsion of deeper layers in           only a few centuries.  Theoretical models and recent observations               suggest that the nebulae acquire their shapes as this fast wind                 overtakes and interacts with the outer layers ejected earlier.  A               recent survey of 50 planetary nebulae shows that the concept of wind            shaping is generally valid, but that the models developed to explain            the phenomenon are much too simplistic.  The goal of this project is            to develop and test more complex models to explain the shapes and               evolutions of planetary nebulae.  Three-dimensional hydrodynamic                models require years to develop and can only reasonably be tested               with the aid of a supercomputer.  Development of the enhanced models            needed to explain nebular shapes will be greatly facilitated by the             combination of Dr. Balick's observational data and model testing                skills with Dr. Icke's theoretical insights and ability to modify the           computer code he has already developed.  Ultimately, their                      collaboration should contribute to resolving some longstanding                  questions about the shapes and evolution of planetary nebulae.",
