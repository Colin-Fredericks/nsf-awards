 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Seifert manifold is a topological space with a bundle-like               structure; that is, it has a parameter space and over every point               in the parameter space, there sits another space called \"a                      fiber.\"  The fibers vary slightly from point to point in the                    parameter space.  Spaces of this class occur naturally in many                  different branches of mathematics, for example, topology,                       differential geometry and algebraic geometry, as well as in                     physics (crystallographic groups).  The investigator will study                 the geometry and topology of these spaces as well as their                      symmetries.  The problems to be studied vary from general                       questions concerning the geometric structures of these spaces to                specific problems connected with the existence of symmetric and                 asymmetric Seifert manifolds.  This will greatly enhance our                    knowledge of this important class of spaces, their intrinsic and                extrinsic geometry, structure and properties.  The broad spectrum               of techniques and methods which will be employed in this research               include methods of algebraic and geometric topology, differential               geometry, Lie group theory and group cohomology.",
