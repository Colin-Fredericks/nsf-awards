 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Anderson and Biscaye propose to construct a carbon                 budget for an upper slope region of the Middle Atlantic Bight.                  Previous studies in this region led to the controversial                        hypothesis that export of Corg from continental margin                          represents a major pathway for transfer of CO2 from the                         atmosphere to the deep ocean.  The source term for their Corg                   budget will be provided by a large number of primary                            productivity and sediment trap flux measurements to be obtained                 during a DOE-funded study of Shelf-Edge Exchange Processes.                     The work will include independent approaches to evaluate the                    rate of Corg reimeralization at the upper slope as well as the                  rate of Corg burial.  One approach will include coupling                        measured solid phase Corg distributions in sediments trap                       fluxes and independently-determined rates of sediment                           accumulation and sediment mixing to infer rates of Corg burial,                 consumption within the mixed layer, and rapid remineralization                  at the sediment-water interface.  The complemetary approach                     will use benthic flux chambers to measure the flux of 02 into                   the sediments, which will be stoichiometrically converted into                  Corg consumption rates, and flux of C02 out of the sediments.                   Chamber-derived fluxes will be compared to Corg                                 remineralization rates inferred from solid phase studies as a                   test for internal consistency and reliability of the Corg                       remineralization rates.  Enumeration of benthic community                       biomass will also provide turnover rates for live carbon in the                 sediments.  Carbon fluxes determined in this study will help                    resolve the controversy regarding the importance to global C02                  cycle of the transport of margin-derived Corg to the deep sea                   and will further provide a quantitative relationship between                    Corg fluxes and benthic ecosystem energy requirements.",
