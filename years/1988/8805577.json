The work focuses on fundamental                        aspects of the acid-base properties of organic molecules.                       Acid-base relationships and their understanding are at the core                 of all reaction chemistry, controlling the most fundamental of                  interactions between molecules.                                                                                                                                 Certain organic molecules are predicted to be extremely strong                  acids when placed in the excited state, yet exhibit no                          measurable indication of that acidity through rapid proton                      transfer.  The principles governing this sluggish behavior will                 be studied in detail. Molecules which exhibit kinetic as well                   as thermodynamic acidity will also be studied. Techniques to be                 utilized include semiempirical molecular orbital calculations,                  steady-state and time resolved emission and absorption                          measurements, photoproduct analysis, and synthetic methods                      development.  Possible applications include better substrates                   for \"pH jump\" experiments and useful photoinitators for                         cationic polymerizations.",
