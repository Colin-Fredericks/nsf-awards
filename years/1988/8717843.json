 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some biologists believe that during the last glaciation,                tropical forest retreated form marginal parts of its range to                   warm moist refuge areas not seriously affected by ice-age                       climatic change.  Such refuge areas would be significant to                     ecologists as well as biogeographers, systematists,                             anthropologists and climatologists.  The idea of unchanged                      refuges will be tested against a detailed record of vegetation in               the warmest and wettest part of equatorial Africa.                                      Many data from tropical highlands indicate a glacial                    temperature lowering of at least 5 degrees C, comparable to the                 modern temperature difference between Boston and Labrador.                      Marine paleoecological data indicate that the tropical ocean                    cooled by only about 1 degree C.  General circulation models of                 the atmosphere do not reconcile these two disparate estimates.                  Pollen analysis and grass cuticle analysis of cores already taken               from four lakes in Cameroun and Ghana will provide a detailed                   30,000-year proxy record for the temperature of West Africa.                    These data will test the idea that even lowland equatorial Africa               was much cooler during the last ice age.  The time-course of                    temperature change will be compared with the modeled temperature                consequences of known changes in atmospheric CO2 and the orbit of               the earth.",
