The team will                     undertake additional excavation at a series of Mayan sites                      located in the roughly triangular valley floor occupied by the                  lower reaches of the Mopan and Macal rivers in Belize.  They will               focus their efforts on two major Mayan sites, Buenavista del Cayo               and Cahal Pech and conduct supplemental excavations in several                  other locations.  As in past work, in addition to test trenches                 they will open large horizonal exposures and this will allow                    interpretation of the functions these areas served and how they                 were integrated into a larger Mayan community.                                                                                                                  Archaeological evidence has shown both that Mayan sites are                     extremely large and that extensive interaction took place among                 them.  Mayan society can not be understood on a small scale                     site-by-site basis; large scale regional work is necessary.  The                archaeological situation that Dr. Ball has discovered is unique                 because the Mopan region includes a number of sites, both large                 and small, which are covered by only a limited amount of                        overburden, which date to a single period of time - the Classic -               and which contain undisturbed remains.  Through large scale                     excavation at several sites Dr. Ball should be able to discover                 not only how each worked but also how they interacted.  Dr. Ball                has adapted models from urban anthropology which describe how                   cities function in order to guide his work.                                                                                                                     This research is important for several reasons.  Because of the                 complexity of its culture archaeologists have long been                         interested in Mayan society, how it arose, functioned and then                  declined.  This research should provide additional insight into                 the question.  Secondly, the Mayans successfully adapted to a                   lowland tropical environment.  Such areas are much more sparsely                populated today than they were in prehistoric times.  Dr. Ball's                research should provide useful information on the organizational                techniques ancient Mayans employed.  Hopefully such data can be                 put to good use in Middle America as well as other parts of the                 world.",
