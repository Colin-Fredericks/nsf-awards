 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cumberland County has traditionally been the center for glass                   manufacturing in New Jersey.  Almost 60 percent of the local economy            was directly and indirectly related to the glass industry.  In recent           years a variety of factors, including high energy costs, foreign                competition, consumer acceptance of plastic, have contributed to a              sharp decline in this sector of the county's economy.  Plant closings           and large scale layoffs raised the local unemployment rate in 1984-85           to 18 percent.  Cumberland County is consistently ranked as one of the          top 10 unemployment areas in the country.  Plastics manufacturing has           begun to become an important aspect of the regional manufacturing               base.  Since a 1983 report on the industry was prepared by the New              Jersey Department of Commerce and Economic Development, the number of           plastic manufacturers in Cumberland County has doubled and the work             force has increased by 53 percent.  As the number of plastics                   manufacturers increase, the need for a skilled work force also                  increases.  To meet this need the college has established a laboratory          facility to support the offering of a new course, Processing of                 Plastics.  This course is a core requirement in a new program for a             Plastics Processing Technician Certificate Program which is serving             both undergraduate students who will transfer and those who are working         in the local area. The laboratory facility is giving the students               hands-on experience in understanding the principles of processing               plastics on machinery and test apparatus; in the melt flow                      characteristics of typical resins in extrusion, injection molding, and          compression molding; and in the testing of melt flow and physical               properties of plastics in accord with commercial methods of                     characterization and assurance for the use in production.                                                                                                       The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.",
