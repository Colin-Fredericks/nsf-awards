The Indian organizer is Dr. S.N. Majhi, Department of                  Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras,                      India.  The conference is aimed at exchange of ideas and                        information among professionals involved in developing and                      analyzing mathematical models of problems arising in various                    scientific and technical areas including engineering sciences,                  theoretical physics, biomedical systems, ecology and                            environmental studies, manufacturing, energy and economics.                     Emphasis to be placed on real world problems and correlating the                predictions from models with available experimental findings.                   The multidisciplinary expertise of participants is to provide                   for exchange of tools and ideas from different applications.                    Proceedings are planned to be published.                                                                                                                        Scope:  The conference organizing committee includes a large                    number of experts from the U.S. and nine other western countries                and the USSR in addition to some of India's top scientists from                 Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Indian Institute of                     Science and the Indian Institutes of Technology.  The conference                is likely to enhance the exchange of information and experiences                between the scientists from these countries and to lead to                      future collaboration especially between the U.S. and India.",
