 "awd_abstract_narration": "Western Washington University will acquire instrumentation which will           provide students in our Optics Concentration with hands-on exposure to          modern methods of laser spectroscopy, optical detection, signal                 processing, and computer-based data acquisition.                                                                                                                The Physics Department will purchase a PRA LN120C2 Combination                  Nitrogen/Dye Laser System, a Stanford Research Systems Model SR400              Gated Photon Counter, and an IBM PC/XT Compatible Computer.                                                                                                     These instruments form a versatile combination which will enable the            students to perform a wide variety of laser spectroscopy experiments in         absorption, fluorescence, Raman, opto-acoustic, opto-galvanic, and              photothermal deflection spectroscopy.  In addition, the nitrogen/dye            laser system will serve as a teaching tool for the study of these               important laser types.                                                                                                                                          This project is significant because it brings to the undergraduate              laboratory, devices and techniques which are routinely used in                  graduate, government, and industrial research laboratories.  It will            enable students to understand and utilize laser spectroscopic                   techniques for the analysis of matter at an earlier stage of their              careers.  Finally, it will serve other institutions through the                 publication of student lab experiments which will be developed.                                                                                                 Western Washington University will match the NSF grant with an equal            amount of funds.",
