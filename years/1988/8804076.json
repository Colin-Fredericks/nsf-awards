The students will work on                numerical solutions of inverse problems for partial differential                equations.  They will focus on certain specific problems, in                    particular on inverse problems arising from the conductivity                    equation.  The inverse problem is to determine the conductivity                 throughout a body from measurements of potentials and currents on               the boundary.  There is no known good way to calculate the                      conductivity.  We intend to explore the recent attempts by                      Wexler, Isaacson, Kim and others to compute the conductivity                    numerically.  The program will run for eight weeks.  For about                  two weeks there will be lectures by one or the other of the                     Principal Investigator's describing the problems and various                    possible numerical approaches.  The students can then begin                     working on projects of their own, using the available computing                 facilities.  The students will be encouraged to work in teams of                two, three or more, possibly in collaboration with the faculty                  members.  At the end the students will be expected to give a                    seminar talk on his/her progress.",
