 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is on the nature of tropical interannual                      variability.  Since the Southern Oscillation-El Nino (ENSO) is                  the most prominent mode of interannual variability, it will be                  the focus of much of the analysis.  The effort includes both                    observational studies and diagnostic studies of General                         Circulation Model (GCM) experiments.  The observational study                   will span the global tropical belt, while the modeling work will                be limited to the tropical Indian and Pacific oceans, and will                  exploit a new suite of ocean analyses being generated by the                    experimental GCM operations at the National Meteorological                      Center.  The two specific research thrusts are : (i) the                        relationship between tropical quasi-biennial variability (QBO)                  and the ENSO phenomenon, and (ii) the r ole of the Indian Ocean                 sea surface temperature variability in the ENSO phenomenon.                          This work is important because it will enhance our                         understanding of the interannual climate variability in the                     tropics and may lead to improvements in dynamics extended range                 prediction for tropics.",
