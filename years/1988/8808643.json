 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many structures (buildings, bridges,....) are supported on deep                 foundations such as driven piles.  In some types of structures the              piles are driven at small horizontal spacings and are subjected to              horizontal loadings.  Examples of such structures include offshore              oil production platforms and bridges subjected to lateral loads from            wind and ocean currents.  No reliable design method exists for such             cases and, as a result, the designs currently used are probably                 conservative in most cases, i.e., larger than necessary amounts of              money are spent to ensure that failure does not occur.  The level of            uncertainty is such, however, that excessive movements sometimes                occur and lead to distress in the structure that is supported on the            piles.                                                                          Recently, several series of full scale lateral load tests were                  performed using pile groups so that reliable information is now                 available to use as a check on the accuracy of analyses.  This                  project involves the first attempt at a full-scale numerical analysis           in three dimensions, of pile groups, using the socalled finite                  element technique.    It should provide a level of insight not                  previously possible.  It may provide a design tool for major                    foundations and data to be used in simplified analyses for less                 complex cases.",
