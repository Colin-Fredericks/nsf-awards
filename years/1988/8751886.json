Such standards could be used for evaluating                       current programs and determining how they can be improved.                      This project would engage many different networks in                            analyzing  both the NCTM standards and the new MSEB framework                   that is being developed to set future direction for                             mathematics education.  Representatives from school boards,                     state agencies, school administrators, and parent groups will                   be asked to react to the proposed recommendations.  This                        activity will provide feedback to NCTM on the appropriateness                   and intelligibility of the standards as drafted and allow the                   mathematics education community to focus on possible                            impediments to  acceptance of higher standards and more                         dramatic change.",
