 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports Dr. C.N.R. Rao,                             Professor, Solid State and Structural Chemistry Unit of the                     Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, for collaborative                       research with Dr. John Honig, Materials Research Center,                        Purdue University.  The research will cover development of                      novel oxide materials with special focus on high-temperature                    superconductors.  The research to be carried out by Dr. Rao                     deals with the synthesis of interesting oxide systems and                       examination of structure-property relations.  It also deals                     with the discovery of new classes of oxide with unusual                         electronic and magnetic properties, including the very                          important property of superconductivity at relatively high                      temperatures.  This project is a continuation of research                       that Dr. Rao has carried out under an earlier NSF grant                         INT-8309897.                                                                                                                                                    Scope:  The collaboration of Professor Rao's team at                            Bangalore and Professor Honig's team at Purdue has been                         successful and resulted in a significant number of                              publications.  Rao is one of India's most distinguished                         scientists.  He has done pioneering research in numerous                        areas of materials and structural chemistry.  It is likely                      that this project will result in significant advances in the                    field of new materials and better material characterization.                    Dr. Honig is a participant in a newly established Indiana                       Center for Innovative Superconductivity Technology, which has                   provided $500,000 for the first year of operation by the                        State of Indiana.  His work with Dr. Rao would fit well with                    the objectives of that center, and with enhancing materials                     science research in the U.S.",
