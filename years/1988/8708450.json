 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seed-bearing plants (flowering plants, conifers, and their              relatives) are by far the dominant elements of modern terrestrial               habitats.  However, the fossil record clearly reveals that this                 was not always the case.  The first evidence of seed plants comes               from Upper Devonian sediments of North America (360 million years               ago), where they represent only one of several very successful                  major plant groups.  At present there is considerable debate over               the evolutionary relationships of these early land plants, and                  the processes at work leading to the eventual dominance of seed                 plants.                                                                                 Drs. Charles Beck and William Stein of the University of                Michigan have assembled the most extensive collection of these                  early Devonian and Carboniferous age seed plants.  Their research               includes: careful documentation of developmental changes in                     morphology in shoot systems; analysis of the architecture of                    primary vascular tissues; computer-aided description of cell and                tissue patterns in sections of fossil material; and assessment of               the evolutionary significance of variation among early seed                     plants and their presumed spore-bearing relatives.  Their work                  will help determine the phylogenetic relationships and early                    origins of the seed plants.",
