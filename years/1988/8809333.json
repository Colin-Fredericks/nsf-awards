 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will concentrate upon achieving high productivity of                 .-endotoxin protein by Bacillus Thuringiensis cells by controlled fed-          batch operation of stirred bioreactors.  The strategy involves growing          the cells to high concentrations in vegetative phase during which the           fermentation parameters will be controlled to minimize formation of             undesirable toxic products.  Minimal requirements of nutrients for              cell growth to high densities will be established by continuous                 cultivation techniques.  The fed-batch cultivation will be fine tuned           so that medium composition at high densities is optimum for subsequent          sporulation and endotoxin formation.                                                                                                                            Biological insecticides are increasingly being viewed as more                   advantageous than chemical pesticides which are generally energy                intensive, have long half lives, and adversely affect many harmless             forms of life.  .-endotoxin is a commercially produced insecticide              that is being studied extensively with major improvements in its                potency.  In addition, spore-forming bacilli are commonly used to               produce many industrially important products; therefore, fundamental            studies involving high density cultivation can improve productivity of          several processes.",
