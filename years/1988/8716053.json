 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides for the continued analysis of electric field                and auroral x-ray data that were acquired on a series of eight                  balloon flights (out of 10 attempted launches) from the South Pole              Station in the austral summer of 1985-86.  The data set is unique,              and when compared with data from other sources such as South Pole               ground based instruments and magnetically conjugate radars it                   should provide new insight into the processes that accelerate                   magnetospheric electrons into the atmosphere.  The data will also               be compared with satellite data to determine the conditions during              which several different auroral phenomena occur.  This project was              carried out in conjunction with the University of Maryland.                                                                                                     Funding is also provided for the support of undergraduate students              under the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Program.                                                                                                 The University of Houston and the scientists are uniquely equipped              to carry out this research.",
