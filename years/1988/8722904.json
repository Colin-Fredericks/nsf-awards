 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ice sheets are caused to move by wind, currents, and pressure                   from other ice.  When the moving ice sheets encounter man-made                  structures (bridges, dams, oil-production islands,....), they can               apply loads large enough to cause catastrophic failures.  Design                of the structures clearly requires an understanding of the ice forces           that are likely to be applied. Existing studies show that the                   physical properties of ice depend on a complicated series of factors,           e.g., temperature, strain rate, air content, and the size and                   orientation of individual ice crystals.  Empirical models are being             developed to provide a description of the physical properties of ice            but long-term benefits are likely to result from a more fundamental             approach in which the physical properties of individual crystals of             ice are first studied and then the resulting properties integrated              into a more general model.This project represents a starting point              for the study of the physical properties of single crystals of ice.             First, it allows the principal investigator to develop appropriate              apparatus and to demonstrate its success.  Second, it allows the                principal investigator to use, and perhaps improve, a technique                 recently developed in Japan for rapid growth of large single crystals           of ice, thus making the research feasible.  Preliminary experiments             on single crystals are planned but the major testing and analytical             phases will require additional funding.",
