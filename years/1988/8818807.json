 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports cooperative research by                     Dr. Saiyed I. Ahmed, School of Oceanography, University of                      Washington, Seattle, and Dr. G.S. Quraishee, Director,                          National Institute of Oceanography, Karachi, Pakistan, on the                   foodweb dynamics of mangrove habitat.  The research objective                   is to determine the relative flow of carbon and energy from                     mangrove and algal detritus to the aquatic foodweb.  This                       information would help identify the relationship between                        environmental and anthropogenic disturbances and these fluxes                   and the mangrove foodweb.  The study will:  1. Examine the                      phenology of Pakistani mangroves with emphasis on leaf-litter                   production  2. Study decomposition of mangrove leaves and                       determine the availability of the resulting particulate and                     disolved organic carbon to bacteria and other aquatic foodweb                   components such as benthic invertebrates  3. Determine the                      relative contribution of mangroves and algae to the primary                     productivity of this estuarine ecosystem and  4. Determine the                  distribution and productivity of bacteria and phytoplankton                     and their relationship with nutrients and other chemical                        factors.                                                                                                                                                        Scope:  The project will involve extensive field work in the                    deltaic area of the Indus river near Karachi in Pakistan.  The                  work will involve several U.S. scientists and graduate                          students from the University of Washington, Scripps Institute                   of Oceanography, University of Georgia and University of                        Miami, and from Pakistan's NIO with logistical support                          provided by the NIO, and the Pakistan Navy, through its                         research vessel as needed.  The Indus delta provides a                          suitable field for this research by allowing for studies in                     the dry season (pre-monsoon), during the rainy season, and                      subsequent to the cessation of rains, thus permitting study of                  the changes in a variety of physical and chemical factors.                      Laboratory work in microbiology and physiology will be done in                  the U.S. and will allow for training of NIO staff.  This will                   enhance the capabilities for the field work.                                                                                                                    The Office of Naval Research is partially supporting this                       research by providing Pakistani currency funds.",
