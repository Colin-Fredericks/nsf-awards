 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in                                     neuroendocrinology between Dr. Bruce McEwen of the                              Rockefeller University and Dr. Alexandro De Nicola at                           the Institute of Biology and Experimental Medicine in                           Buenos Aires, Argentina. This work will identify the                            characteristics of and the degree of overlap between                            two receptor systems for steroid hormones in the                                brain. Understanding the communication between                                  steroidal receptors is important to interpreting                                interactions between other neurotransmitters and                                receptors. The use of new molecular biological                                  methodology will lead to new advances in brain                                  neuroscience.                                                                                                                                                   The principal investigators have a history of previous                          successful collaboration and a former student of Dr.                            De Nicola, Dr. Coirini, is now a post-doc in Dr.                                McEwen's laboratory. Both laboratories are well                                 equipped for their part of the research and therefore                           significant contributions can be made by both sides in                          investigating the regulation of mineralocorticoid                               receptors by glucocorticoids and the regulation of                              glucocorticoid receptors by mineralocorticoids. Also,                           the levels of these hormones and how the binding                                activity is affected by the regulation will be                                  determined. This work will continue a productive                                four-year collaboration.",
