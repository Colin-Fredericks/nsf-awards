 "awd_abstract_narration": "Doctoral student Byron Alexander proposes to study the                       ancestor-descendant relationships within the bee genus Nomada,                  using morphological data from the literature, museum visits, and                from borrowed collections.  His advisor, George Eickwort, is a                  leading researcher on social insects.  Both social and parasitic                behavior have evolved from nest-building ancestors in this genus,               and it is unclear whether 1) the social species are a separate                  evolutionary branch within the genus, or 2) social behavior has                 evolved independently several times.  A well-established                        evolutionary framework for this group would provide the means for               assessing these alternatives.                                                      The evolution of behavior is an important facet of biology,                  and behavior of certain insects such as bees can have important                 economic implications.  The proposed research can have subtantial               impact beyond the small community of specialists working on this                taxon.",
