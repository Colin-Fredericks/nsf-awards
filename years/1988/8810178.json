 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the development of multivariable                 feedback control systems design in the presence of disturbances,                noise, and plant uncertainty.  In particular, we will consider the l1           -based design methodology recently developed to optimally reject                arbitrary, but bounded and persistent disturbances or noise.  The               objective is to develop the theory further to achieve performance               robustness: stability and good performance in the presence of plant             uncertainties.  Better representation of disturbances will be achieved          by introducing time-varying pre-filters, and hence the theory will be           generalized for such problems.  We will develop the theory to handle            infinite dimensional systems (e.g. systems with delays).  This will             make the design methodology applicable to a larger class of problems            such as systems governed by partial differential equations.  Software           based on numerically robust algorithms and state-space computations             will be developed, and then the theory will be applied on some                  practical examples.  This project will have a significant impact on             the general design philosophy and the understanding of uncertain                systems.  The results will be readily applicable to many problems such          as space applications, robotics, process control and others.  Also, it          will have an impact on related fields such as adaptive control.",
