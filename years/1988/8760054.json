 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most synthetic colorants are coal tar derivatives many of                  which have been shown to be potential causative agents of                       hyperactivity in children, cancer, embryotoxicity and                           allergenicity.  On the other hand, natural colors do not                        exhibit these undesirable attributees and may, in fact, have a                  positive effect on human health, presumably due to their                        activity as antioxidants and traps of toxic metabolic                           intermediates.                                                                       As sources of natural colorants, microalgae are greatly                    underutilized.  This award will support research needed to                      evaluate algal pigments as potential colorants for food,                        cosmetic abd pharmaceutical products.  Initially carotenoid                     producing strains will be studied.  Cultures of several algal                   species which produce high levels of carotenoids will be                        established.  Conditions for optimum growth and carotenoid                      production will be determined.  Preparative amounts of the                      pigments will be extracted and tested.  Finally a cost analysis                 of the process will be performed.  If the project is successful                 a safe and useful souce of colorants will be made available to                  the food, cosmetic and phamaceutical industry.",
