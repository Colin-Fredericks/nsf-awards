 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project's aim is the development of a new technical                    curriculum in environmental monitoring using state-of-the-art methods           and technologies.  Included in the equipment provided through this              award are a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS), a separate GC,         a high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC), an atomic absorption            spectrometer (AA), and a modern, computer-linked weather station.  With         the help of this equipment, students learn the procedures and                   principles involved in analyzing indoor and outdoor air, water, soil,           and animal and human tissue for the presence of environmental                   contaminants resulting from agricultural and forestry pesticides,               hazardous wastes, and industrial emissions.  The resulting new                  curriculum, backed by the institution's excellent computer facilities,          gives a technical focus to the existing B.S. in Environmental Studies           Program and makes possible the institution of a new A.A. degree                 program in Environmental Monitoring Technology.                                                                                                                      The project addresses the nation's growing need for competent              pollution and hazardous substances control technicians, provides                skilled manpower for Northern Maine's environmental laboratories, and           affords opportunities for upward mobility to the economically depressed         predominantly French-American (Acadian) people of the St. John Valley           in Northern Maine which the institution serves.                                                                                                                      The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
