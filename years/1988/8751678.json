 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goals of the project are to offer intensive instruction in             computing and algorithmic mathematics to sixty secondary school teachers        and to help them in extending the ideas and knowledge obtained in the           project to many more teachers in their respective school districts. This        is to take place over a period of two summer sessions along with an             individualized guided home study program during the intervening academic        year when the participants are to extend the subject matter presented in        the first summer session. The participants are to maintain close written        and telephone contact with the project faculty and staff to help the            participants implement the new ideas in their schools. Additional               follow-up activity during the year includes a two day miniconference to         discuss the teaching of computer science and algorithmic mathematics and        to provide the participants with intensive supervised hands-on                  instruction. There is to be widespread dissemination activities of the          project activities to reach a wider audience extending the direct               contact with the 60 initial participants. There is to be academic credit        at the undergraduate level as well as the post graduate level equivalent        to 20 upper division quarter hours.",
