 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Geographic Information System Laboratory is established to               improve the quality of undergraduate instruction in the Natural                 Resources Management and Earth Sciences Programs.  The laboratory               includes three workstations, ancillary hardware and GIS software in two         formats (vector-based and raster-based in common use. Junior and senior         level students are applying GIS to problems in the fields of natural            resources management, geology, geography and planning. GIS is used to           obtain and manipulate special information, and the interpretation and           synthesis of this information. GIS allows students to address research          problems that normally require inordinate amounts of time and effort to         answer using traditional techniques of special analysis such as manual          overlays. The use of GIS technology is becoming increasingly common in          the fields affected by this award. This new laboratory enhances the             problem solving, research, and professional capabilities of graduates           from the respective programs.                                                                                                                                        The award will be matched by an equal sum from the grantee.",
