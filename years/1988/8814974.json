 "awd_abstract_narration": "Deactivation of fluid cracking catalysts (FCCs) is studied.  The                research focusses on poisoning by nickel and passivation by                     antimony on various components of model FCCs.  A multitechnique                 approach that emphasizes in-situ experiments is used to obtain a                more fundamental understanding of the catalytic, electronic, and                structural properties of these materials.  Specific methods used                are luminescence, antimony Moessbauer spectroscopy, X-ray powder                diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and scanning electron                  microscopy.  Catalytic studies are done in collaboration with Dr.               Mario Occelli of Union Oil Co.                                                                                                                                  Fluid cracking catalysts (FCCs) are used to reduce the average                  molecular weight (and with it viscosity, boiling point, and                     density) of hydrocarbon oils derived from petroleum, coal,                      plants, or other sources, and are therefore key elements in the                 refining of these materials.  The natural oils often contain                    transition metal (most commonly nickel or vanadium) complexes                   that deactivate the FCC.  (Recycling of oil is also inhibited by                metal contamination.)  This line of investigation aims at                       development of FCC materials resistant to poisoning that could be               used with metal-contaminated (and therefore less expensive) oils.",
