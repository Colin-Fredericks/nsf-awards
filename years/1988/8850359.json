Implementation of the network        will take place in three stages.  The first stage will consist of a             workshop in the summer of l988 to establish contacts between people who         have been working in the field and those who are just beginning.  The           second stage will include the establishment of a network that will              provide support for people in the process of developing new projects.           Network activities will include consultation services, a project                databank, a materials resource clearinghouse, the publication of                workshop proceedings and a newsletter.  Finally regional workshops              building on the model of the first workshop will be held so that many           more mathematicians will be reached.",
