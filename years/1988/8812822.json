 "awd_abstract_narration": "The topic of racial inequalities in education has long been an issue of         sociological as well as societal concern.  Some feel that it can be             explained by the economic and political situation in which educational          institutions are embedded.                                                                                                                                      This study looks at racial inequalities in the southern United States           at two crucial points of transition  -- 1890 to 1910, when blacks were          disfranchised and stripped of citizenship rights, and 1960 to 1980,             when blacks regained the vote and a place in the political process.             The goal is to examine the educational consequences of these dramatic           political transformations, and the way in which political structures            tempered the effect of the economy on educational inequality in the             form of enrollments and educational opportunities.  The economy may             change, but have little effect on racial inequality.  For example, the          racial state was very much in place in both 1910 and 1960, although the         southern economy was altered considerably by the decline of plantation          agriculture that followed from New Deal political policies.                                                                                                     The study will use a variety of data sources, including U. S. Census            material as well as state-by-state reports of enrollments and other             characteristics of school systems across the years, along with rates of         black voter registration across states.  The principal outcome of               interest is educational opportunities, in the form of enrollment rates          for black and whites, level of public school segregation, and the               experience of white flight from public schools.                                                                                                                 This research will provide a comprehensive study of racial inequality           in Southern education.  The formalization and institutionalization of           inequality in the early part of the century as well as the unravelling          of these institutional arrangements in the period since the 1960s are           important topics -- historically and theoretically.",
