 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of                 the Chemistry Division is aimed at improving our                                molecular-level understanding of the structure and dynamics of                  solutions.  Such advances can help one predict how chemical                     reactions in solution are affected by the ion-ion and                           ion-solvent forces.  Recently the electron exchange between                     ferrous and ferric ions, a paradigm of oxidation-reduction                      reactions in solution, was investigated with respect to the                     effect of changing the solvent from water to heavy water.  The                  results invite further model studies of the structure and                       dynamics of the ion-water hydration complex.  Another aspect                    concerns effects of fluctuating polarization fields in the                      medium.  A new theory gives a unified view of the thermodynamic                 and dynamic aspects for the usual dielectric models; it invites                 being extended to molecular models.                                                  The ion distributions in solution provide a connection                     between the effects of ions on chemical reactions and other                     solution properties including activity coefficients, electrical                 conductance, NMR relaxation, and diffraction of x-rays and                      neutrons.  Current research includes the development of the                     theory of transport in solutions so that conductivity in the                    molar concentration range and even in mixed electrolytes can be                 related to the ion distributions and the models from which they                 are calculated.",
