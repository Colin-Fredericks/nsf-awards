 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides the first of an expected three years of                     support to permit Dr. Wallace and his colleagues to apply their                 mtDNA techniques to a number of anthropological problems.  It                   will allow continued categorization of both Old and new World                   mtDNA types and provide additional information on the original                  peopling and subsequent diversification of Native American                      populations in the New World.  Dr. Wallace will collect blood                   samples from various Native American and Asian groups.  These                   will be fractionated into cell types and lymphocytes immortalized               with EBV.  The mtDNA type of each individual will then be                       determined by digestion with six restriction endonucleases and                  the fragment types detected by Southern blotting.  Lymphoblast                  mtDNAs from  representative individuals will be examined in                     greater detail using additional restriction endonucleases,                      mtDNA:RNA heteroduplexes and mtDNA sequencing.                                                                                                                  Because each individual inherits mtDNA only from their mother,                  mitocondrial DNA reflects lineage in a straightforward                          genetically simple way.  Because because it mutates relatively                  rapidly it serves an an excellent marker to trace population                    movement, both human and non-human over time.  For many years                   anthropologists have used other genetically controlled physical                 traits such as tooth shape and size in a similar way to determine               both the relationships between extant populations and trace their               history.  mtDNA can, in theory, do this much more effectively.                  One question of great anthroplogical interest is when prehistoric               humans entered the New World and where they may have come from.                 Although it is known that these first inhabitants are of Asian                  stock and crossed over a then-exposed Bering land bridge, the                   details of this major migration are missing.  Dr. Wallace's                     research should help to answer this question.                                                                                                                   This research is important for several reasons.  It provides a                  new and extremely powerful tool for anthropological and                         historical research.  Because the scientists who are most expert                with this technique are not anthropologists it is important to                  build bridges between these two communities and this project will               help to accomplish that. Also, because, in some instances,                      archaeological and linguistic data allow reconstruction of past                 population movements, anthropology can provide controlled                       contexts which molecular biologists can use to advantage.",
