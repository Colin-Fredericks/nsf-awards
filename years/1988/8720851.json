 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 5.1 m<b,Lg> southeastern Illinois earthquake of June 10,               1987 triggered 62 blast monitors in the coal mines and limestone                and western Kentucky.  The resulting set of particle velocity                   records is the largest sample of free-field ground motions of any               earthquake in the central or eastern United States.                                                                                                                  Corrections for site and source effects in the ground motion               traces are shown to reduce the variability in resulting data set.               Site effects are based on shallow geotechnical investigations                   conducted to determine P- and S-wave velocities of the overburden               as a function of depth, depth to bedrock, and bedrock topography.               Source effects are based on the focal mechanism, focal depth, and               type of faulting associated with the June 10th earthquake.  The                 resulting site and source corrected free-field particle velocity                records, used in conjunction with random vibration analysis and                 theoretical considerations, yeild an improved model for predicting              seismically induced ground motions in the central United States                 that has appreciably less variability then existing models.",
