Their participation will permit increased interaction         between these scientists and colleagues from the U.S. and other major           countries sponsoring basic research.  The meetings involved will include        those of various SCOR working groups, including those dealing with              oceanic carbon dioxide measurement technology and experimental                  ecosystems, and SCOR standing committees on climate change and global           ocean fluxes.  This increased interaction will foster increased                 cooperation in joint research projects in the areas identified and              others as well.",
