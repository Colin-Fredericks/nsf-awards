 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project which deals with the chemistry of unusual                          heterogeneous organo-iron reactions is being supported by the                   Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program.  The novelty of                   this chemistry lies in the unprecedented relative reactivities                  of the various types of carbon-hydrogen bonds toward hydrogen                   atom abstraction by iron metal under special conditions.  The                   hypothesis that these reactions involve the intermediacy of                     organoiron reagents is being tested.  Results from this study                   will give important insights into the chemical nature of                        species (e.g. certain enzymes) which contain the carbon-iron                    bond.                                                                                                                                                           This research program is studying the methods so far                            established in the Gif and Gif-Orsay systems for selective                      oxidation of saturated hydrocarbons.  Recently a new                            development of the Gif system has uncovered a remarkable new                    reaction, which under very mild conditions permits the                          selective phenylselenation of saturated hydrocarbons.  This and                 the preceding reaction, deserve further application and, in                     particular, mechanistic investigation.   The iron species which                 appear to be responsible for the Gif substitution are being                     synthesized.  Competitive trapping procedures are proposed                      using intramolecular traps to demonstrate the role of the                       iron-carbon sigma-bond and of the iron-carbene double bond.                     Further new reactions of saturated hydrocarbons will be                         invented.",
