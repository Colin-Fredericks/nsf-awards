 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Kinsey is supported by a grant from The Physicl Chemistry                   Program to perform research in the field of molecular dynamics.                 Dr. Kinsey has devised sophisticated spectroscopic measurement                  techniques which enable chemists to observe individual                          molecules in the process of photodissociation after they have                   absorbed a photon.  The technique is being applied to                           photochemically important atmospheric compounds such as ozone                   and hydrocarbons.                                                                                                                                               When a molecule absorbs photons of a wavelength that promote                    photodissociation, it usually falls apart in a time which is                    short compared to the characteristic time for emission of                       light.  Thus only a very tiny fraction of the absorbed photons                  are re-emitted.  The spectroscopic properties of this miniscule                 minority are, however, extraordinarily instructive in showing                   dynamic processes both in the electronically excited state and                  in the ground state.  Unusually long progressions in                            ground-state vibrations appear.  A time-dependent formulation                   of Raman scattering reveals that the pattern of intensities in                  these wide-ranging spectra relates directly to the                              excited-state potential energy surface.  Dr. Kinsey's research                  centers on extension and refinement of this newly discovered                    approach to the dynamics of extremely short-lived molecules and                 stable ground states.  The approach will combine experimental                   and theoretical efforts to shed light on the details of                         \"half-collison\" processes.",
