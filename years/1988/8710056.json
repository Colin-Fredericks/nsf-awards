 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed researh will analyze the distribution of juvenile                  hormone (JH) receptor proteins in fat body nuclei of melanoplus                 bivittaus.  JH stimulates synthesis of egg yolk protein by                      grasshopper fat body, and JH receptors are thought to convert the               hormone signal to activity at the gene level.  A combination of                 methods used to isolate chromatin, nuclear matrix, and steroid                  acceptor sites from chromatin will be adapted to analyze JH                     receptors.  Agents such as ionic and non-ionic detergents,                      neutral and chaotropic salts, and site specific enzymes will be                 used along with immunological techniques and Western blots                      currently being developed to simplify receptor identification.                  Tissues from females, males, and nymphs will be used to judge the               physiological importance of receptor distribution within nuclei.                Long-term goals include analyses of regulation of receptor                      synthesis in target and nontarget tissues, of receptor evolution,               and of gene regulatory sites.  The principles of JH action as                   determined for the grasshopper should be equally valid for other                insects, and additional knowledge of JH action may allow design                 of chemicals that target the insect hormone pathway to control                  populations with no harm to vertebrates.",
