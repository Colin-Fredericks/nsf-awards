 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Dr. Ross D. Powell and an assistant from                 Northern Illinois University to collaborate with Dr. Maxwell R.                 Banks of the University of Tasmania, Australia and Dr. Victor A.                Gostin of the University of Adelaide, Australia during four months              of field work in Australia.  The project will focus on describing               the glacial marine sedimentary deposits of Tasmania and the Sydney              Basin in the Tasman Fold Belt of eastern Australia and on                       interpreting these sediments in terms of their different                        depositional environments.  Standard sedimentological and glacial`              geological techniques will be used for collecting data at outcrops              during field research and for subsequent laboratory analysis.                                                                                                   Results of this research will further our understanding of the                  glacial conditions and fluctuations, climatic regimes, and major sea            level fluctuations during the Carboniferous-Permian glaciation of               Gondwana.  This will allow reevaluation of a classic model of ice               shelf sedimentation.  The work will benefit from the complementary              skills of the U.S. and Australian researchers.  Dr. Powell's                    background in modern glacial marine settings, when coupled with the             geological field experience of Drs. Banks and Gostin, provides the              kind of expertise needed to properly interpret the complex                      glacimarine sedimentary record of the region.",
