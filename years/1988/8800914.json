 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many migratory birds demonstrate a remarkable fidelity to                       breeding sites over a period of years.  In some of these species,               individuals that nested successfully in one year are more likely                to return the following year than are individuals whose nests                   failed.  It is not clear, however, whether this difference is due               to increased dispersal or increased mortality among birds that                  fail.  This study is an attempt to demonstrate experimentally a                 causal relationship between nest failure and dispersal.  Three                  species of migratory birds breeding in shelterbelts in south-                   central North Dakota will be examined.  The research is designed                so that short-distance dispersal can be observed on the study                   area and so that comparisons can be made between return rates of                birds with naturally successful, naturally failing, and                         experimentally failing nests.  Understanding whether birds make                 dispersal decisions based on previous experience yields insights                into the study of learning and long-term memory in animals.  An                 accurate description of how birds choose their breeding                         territories and move between habitat patches is important for                   studies of gene flow, population structure and dynamics,                        evolutionary change in small populations, and individual                        response to changing conditions.                                                                                                                                The results of this study can also have practical applications in               the field of conservation biology.  Because this study examines                 birds breeding in isolated patches, it yields information on                    movements within and between small habitat \"islands.\"  Such                     information can be useful in the design and management of nature                reserves.",
