 "awd_abstract_narration": "The tectonics of the southern Appalachians is dominated by                 northwestward vergent overthrusting and northeast trending dextral              shearing of presumed late paleozoic age.  These events obscure                  earlier deformational events.  However, recently completed                      research suggests that the first event associated with the                      Alleghanian orogeny in the eastern Piedmont of Georgia and South                Carolina was an episode of ductile low-angle normal faulting.                   This project will test this extensional hypothesis by mapping the               kiokee belt and its boundaries westward into Georgia to a region                where the overprinting effects of subsequent deformations are less              severe and where the normal faults bounding the kiokee belt are                 exposed.  Structural studies will clarify the shear sense and                   displacement directions and the deformation chronology will be                  established by U-Pb and 40 Ar/39 Ar techniques.  The results are                expected to help explain the brief periods of extensional                       tectonics that commonly characterize some collisional orogens.",
