 "awd_abstract_narration": "This multifaceted program known as the Institute for Chemical Education         (ICE) will continue its work to enhance chemical education at all levels        by fostering continuing professional growth, developing and                     disseminating creative hands-on teaching methods and helping to                 strengthen the content background of chemistry teachers.  Programs are          being held at four campuses throughout the country, University of               Wisconsin at Madison, University of Arizona, University of Maryland at          College Park and University of Northern Colorado.                                                                                                               Chemical Instrumentation Update Workshops will be given at three ICE            Centers, UWI, UA and UMD together with a fourth separately proposed at          University of California at Berkeley.  These workshops are designed to          renew the enthusiasm of these selected teachers and provide them with a         backgroud in modern instrumental methods.  An Instrumentation Loan              program at the Arizona site will enhance this program.                                                                                                          A two-week Supplements Program will be held at each of three of the             Centers, UWI, UMD amd UNCO, with a fourth at UCB. This program will             provide opportunities for elementary and secondary teachers to learn how        to use demonstrations and hands-on activities in their classrooms.              Science supervisors will be included as participants in this program to         enhance the implementation of these activities in schools.  Three               community college and university colleagues will participate in order to        develop  programs which they may disseminate in their own locales.                                                                                              The Chemistry Fundamentals Program is a longer program (six weeks at UWI        and four weeks for each of two summers at UMD and UCB) designed to              provide content background, laboratory activities and teaching                  strategies to teachers whose background is deficient in content and             methodology.                                                                                                                                                    Each component of the ICE activities can stand on its own merits, but           the combination of activities provides a productive climate of                  interaction and collaboration.",
