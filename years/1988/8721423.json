Specific                  objectives of the project are: (1) to examine the theoretical and               empirical bases of lottery-dependent expected utility models; (2)               to study the role of ambiguity in the specification of                          probabilities; (3) to empirically test several models of                        preference; and (4) to develop a model that incorporates equity                 considerations in the development of risk management                            alternatives.                                                                                                                                                   Despite the importance of equity considerations in the decision                 making process, little effort has been made to develop models                   that explicitly address issues related to the distribution of                   risks and benefits.  Results of this innovative project will be                 used to identify strategies that can simultaneously maximize                    efficiency and equity. It is expected that this project will be                 useful to analysts and decision makers in formulating and                       evaluating alternative risk management strategies.",
