 "awd_abstract_narration": "The evolution of complex social organization is a problem of               central interest to archaeology.  Many theories have been                       advanced to explain the development of pre-state chiefdoms.  This               project will test one of these theories: that the development of                chiefdoms is an oscillating process involving the interaction of                competing chiefs, inter-group warfare, and trade.                                                                                                                    The researcher will test this theory of the development of                 regional political entities with materials from Cahokia, the                    largest Mississippian period site in eastern North America.                     Temporal and spatial patterning of architecture and artifacts                   from a large residential area will be used to monitor variations                in household organization and production and in elite control of                the production and trade of prestige goods.                                                                                                                          This project will increase our understanding of the social                 and political organization of Native American groups that lived                 in the American Midwest region.",
