 "awd_abstract_narration": "The many-body problem in quantum mechanics is known for its                     complexity.  The multiconfiguration Hartree-Fock (MCHF) method                  developed for bound state atomic system performs well on systems                that can be modeled as two-electron systems, but as the number or               electrons increases the computational task rapidly becomes out of               hand, and simplifying assumptions are introduced that decrease                  the level of accuracy in the prediction of properties.                                                                                                          The approach in the future to the solution of such problems lies                in the use of computer systems where many processors are working                concurrently on a given problem.  The use of such systems                       presents many problems - old programs cannot simply be transfered               to such an environment.  New methods and new approaches need to                 be developed.                                                                                                                                                   The long-range goal of this project is to develop parallel                      algorithms for atomic structure calculations for computer                       architectures of the future.  The first step in this process is                 the revision of the numerical methods on which the MCHF                         calculations are based from finite difference approximations to                 the expansion of functions in terms of a spline basis.  Symbol                  manipulation techniques will be explored to perform the exact                   evaluation of needed integrals.  A TOOLPACK system will be used                 to assist in program transformations for different architectures.",
