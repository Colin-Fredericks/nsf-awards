 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to clarify some of the pathways by which                     lipid metabolism regulates eukaryotic cell activities at the                    membrane level.  The experiments will involve the unicellular                   organisms Dunaliella salina and Tetrahymena pyriformis, which                   have been utilized extensively as model systems for plant and                   animal cells, respectively.  The studies will emphasize three                   interrelated areas:  1) regulatory mechanisms by which the                      \"fluidity\" of each functionally different membrane of a cell                    is maintained at a near optimal level, 2)  formation and                        dissemination of different classes of proteins containing                       covalently-bound fatty acids, and 3)  the control and                           consequences of polyphosphoinositide turnover during the                        transduction of extracellular signals by D. salina.                                                                                                             Based upon preliminary findings, it seems very likely that                      all these three research areas are directly or indirectly                       related in the control of cellular function.  By employing                      radioisotope labeling experiments and detailed analysis of                      membrane lipids and proteins by chromatography and                              electrophoresis, the biochemical pathways involved will be                      characterized and their regulation studied by first                             perturbing membrane fluidity experimentally and then                            observing how the control processes restore normal function.                    %%%%                                                                            Individual key reactions of lipid metabolism are being                          studied in model plant systems.  These reactions are also                       being studied not as isolated events but as how they serve                      the cell to provide the physical environment needed for                         normal cell functioning.  Many reactions crucial to life take                   place in cellular membranes, not free in solution.  This work                   focuses on in vivo metabolism in order to gain a realistic                      picture of cell metabolism in the normal state.",
