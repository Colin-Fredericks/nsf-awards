 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to test the relative importance of                  functional versus aesthetic mate choice in the American                         goldfinch, and to investigate the possibility of \"runaway\"                      evolutionary change from functional to aesthetic mate choice.                   Two important topics will be investigated--the relationship                     between preferred naturally-occurring traits and reproductive                   success in the field, and the potential for aesthetic choice,                   as indicated by the mate preferences of females.  Laboratory                    experiments will be performed to assess the influences on mate                  choice of naturally-varying traits, slight exaggerations of                     natural traits, novel traits represented by \"artificial\"                        characteristics, and of natural traits.  Also to be assessed                    are the potentially important traits in a population of wild                    goldfinches with known ages and reproductive histories.  This                   research will test important hypotheses of sexual selection and                 provide insight into the evolution of species appearance in                     this and other monogamous bird species.  The institutional                      affiliation of the Fellow for the two year project duration is                  with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; the field                  work will  take place at Guelph, Ontario, Canada.",
