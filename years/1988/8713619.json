 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Metiu is supported by the Physical Chemistry Program to                     work on the development of theoretical methods to compute the                   rate coefficients of some of the most basic thermal processes                   in surface science:  diffusion of hydrogen on a metal surface                   and the desorption of hydrogen on a metal surface and the                       desorption of alkali from metal surfaces.  These are prototypes                 of two of the most common chemical processes:  proton transfer                  over and through a barrier and a curve crossing from an ionic                   neutral state.  They are both induced by the thermal                            fluctuations on the surface and are thus simple examples of                     reactions taking place in a condensed medium.  In addition, Dr.                 Metiu and his students plan to work on the photodissociation of                 CH3I. A quantitative connection between the dynamics on the                     upper states and the spectroscopic signals given by the                         decomposing molecule will be established.                                                                                                                       This research program will be assisted by the acquistion of a                   new computer workstation that will strongly enhance the                         computational power available to support this program.  By                      acquiring the new workstation, Dr. Metiu's group will                           accelerate appreciably the turn around time for the computed                    results and will have good access to the NSF-supported                          supercomputer centers.  This additional hardware is provided                    under NSF initiative to support Computational Science and                       Engineering.",
