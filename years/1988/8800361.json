 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many problems in engineering can be modeled and studied as                 nonlinear network flow problems.  Examples include such large-                  scale systems as congested transportation networks, telecommuni-                cation and computer systems, and resource distribution networks.                Since such applications require timely solution, network                        algorithms must be designed for efficient computation and, hence,               take advantage of any special problem structure and high-                       performance computer architectures.  In this project, several                   serial and parallel equilibration algorithms will be developed                  for pure and generalized nonlinear network flow problems, with                  and without capacities.  The node-link formulation of the                       problems, rather than the path, will be used for both fixed and                 elastic demand problems to substantially reduce the computer                    storage requirements of such algorithms.  First, equilibration                  algorithms will be derived for quadratic networks, and then for                 more highly nonlinear networks, and convergence conditions                      established.  Network topologies will then be defined to                        construct specialized algorithms.  All algorithms will be                       computationally tested on different architectures using real-                   world data arising from a variety of applications, to demonstrate               empirically their performance.                                                          Dr. Nagurney will develop and teach a course for upper-level            undergraduates and graduate students on network equilibrium                     taught from the standpoint of competitive equilibrium problems                  and variational inequalities, in the spring 1989.  She will                     conduct a series of lectures to faculty and students about her                  research on equilibrium algorithms for nonlinear network flow                   problems.  In addition, Dr. Nagurney will organize a                            distinguished lecture series in which senior female scholars will               be invited to M.I.T. to relate their experiences as female                      researchers.                                                                            This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1)              to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                  engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF                  and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and                     engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists                and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic                    institutions.  By encouraging the participation of women in                     science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future                     scientific vitality.",
