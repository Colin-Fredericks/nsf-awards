 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research program is to obtain experimental data           on the behavior of mixtures of polymers and solvents and to develop             methods to correlate and predict this behavior.  In order to obtain a           predictive method, a new group-contribution equation of state is to be          developed based either on the Sanchez-Lacombe lattice-hole theory or            the generalized Van der Waals partition function approach.  In                  addition, the effects of polydispersion are to be taken into account.           A computer database is being created on available literature data and           the new experimental data obtained in this program.  Data are being             collected on binary interactions by use of inverse gas chromatography           and piezoelectric sorption techniques and on ternary systems by the             study of liquid-liquid equilibria using size exclusion chromatography           for analysis.  Experimental measurements will be taken over a wide              range of solvent concentrations with a carefully selected set of                carefully prepared monodispersed polymers, which in a number of cases           will be provided by the industrial DIPPR sponsors.  The PIs have                established close collaboration with the workers in the polymer                 laboratory at the Technical University of Denmark.  This carefully              built network of theoretical insights, experimental apparatus,                  practical objectives, industrial consultation, and international                cooperation provides a unique opportunity to launch a new and vigorous          attack on the serious problems relating to polymer solutions.",
