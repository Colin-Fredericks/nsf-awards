 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the project is to study the aggregation of                     associating polymers through computer simulations and theoretical               modeling.  The processes to be examined are the aggregation of                  ionomers in solution, mesophase formation in liquid crystalline                 polymers and the formation of reverse micelles and                              microemulsions.  The unique properties of these systems make them               important materials in such fields as oil recovery, lubrication,                corrosion control and electronics, as well as having                            pharmaceutical applications in the areas of drug delivery and                   controlled release.  All the materials above derive their unusual               characteristics from the fact that they are composed of molecules               that interact in solution and associate into various well-defined               aggregates.  The purpose of this study is to understand how the                 geometry of the associating molecules determines the structures                 that are formed.  In order to study how the size and shape of an                aggregate evolves and is affected by various parameters, the                    computer simulations developed to study diffusion-limited                       aggregation (DLA) will be used.  By understanding the factors                   that influence the microstructure (the aggregate), it is hoped                  that we can govern their morphology and in turn control the                     macroscopic properties of these materials.  Thus, the results                   will be generated with the goal that they can be used in                        tailoring new materials for a variety of technological                          applications.",
