 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ciliate predation on other ciliates is common among members                of the protozooplankton and may be a significant pathway through                which secondary production is transferred.  The impact of inter-                species ciliate predation in Chesapeake Bay will be studied                     through a combination of laboratory experiments, manipulations of               field populations, and surveys of ciliate protozooplankton                      abundance, species composition, and dietary habits.  It is                      proposed that: 1) inter-ciliate predators are a consistent and                  locally abundant component of the marine protozooplankton                       community; 2) a significant amount of secondary production by                   bacterivorous and herbivorous ciliates is consumed by ciliate                   predation; 3) grazing and growth rates of inter-species ciliate                 predators are sufficient to exploit and potentially control                     locally dense prey populations.                                                      The abundance and widespread occurrence of ciliated protozoa               among the marine protozooplankton suggest that they play a                      pivotal role in the planktonic food web of the ocean.  The                      importance of ciliates as consumers of phytoplankton and, to a                  lesser extent, bacterioplankton has been well studied and is now                generally accepted.  While large zooplankton have been viewed as                the predominant consumers of ciliates, there is little evidence                 indicating that grazing by metazoa has a substantial impact on                  ciliate populations.  Therefore, uncertainty still exists as to                 the fate of secondary production by ciliates.  Coats has designed               a series of prey switching experiments to examine the hypothesis                that certain species of the ciliates themselves consume much of                 this secondary production.  It has recently become apparent that                much of the plant - animal interactions in the sea are dominated                by the activities of such microbial organisms and this novel work               will clarify the role of inter - ciliate predation in marine food               webs.",
