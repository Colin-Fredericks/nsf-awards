 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solar radiation in the ultraviolet and X ray regions ionizes the                upper atmosphere during the daytime above an altitude of about 80               km. The D and E regions of ionization that are located below                    about 120 km absorb radio waves fairly strongly, but the ions                   recombine rapidly after sunset. This leaves ionization in the F                 region at heights from 200 to 300 km that recombines only slowly                during the night, and is normally a good reflector of radio                     waves, making possible long distance radio communication at                     night.  However, at times the layer becomes quite irregular and                 inhomogeneous and produces fading and distortion of radio                       transmissions, and for high frequency transmission from                         satellites produces \"scintillation\" that has similar deleterious                effects. The layer irregularities are generated by electric                     fields and F region winds in ways that are not fully understood.                The purpose of the present work is to obtain data on                            scintillation at latitudes ranging from the equator to the polar                caps, and to perform computer simulations and modelling, in a                   research program designed to give a better understanding of the                 global ionospheric-thermospheric dynamics that are responsible                  for the generation, evolution, and dissipation of these                         irregularities.",
