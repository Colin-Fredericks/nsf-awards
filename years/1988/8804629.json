 "awd_abstract_narration": "Johnson's research in the Devonian of the western U.S. involves                 six areas of endeavor.  1. Brachiopod systematics; three new                    brachiopod genera will be described and illustrated.  2.                        Brachiopod-dominated communities; more than 30 communities known                in the Devonian of Nevada will be analyzed in terms of their                    relative positions in an established time-rock framework.  This                 will be a synthesis of data collected during the last 25 years.                 3. The Eifelian, late Frasnian, and early Famennian conodont and                brachiopod sequences will be made known by detailed sampling of                 measured sections in the northern Antelope Range, Eureka County,                Nevada.  4. The depositional history of Givetian and late                       Frasnian-early Famennian rock sequences in he northern Antelope                 Range will be interpreted by study of rocks in a number of                      measured sections that are well dated by conodonts.  The Givetian               sequence of events is like that of the Keg River barrier of                     Canada.  Quartz sand in upper Frasnian limestones is of western                 derivation.  5.  It is intended to analyze geology along the                    frontal margin of the Roberts Mountains thrust from data gathered               during the last 12 years.  6.  A review paper will be prepared on               the Paleozoic of the Western United States.",
