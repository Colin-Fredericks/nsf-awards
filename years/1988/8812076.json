 "awd_abstract_narration": "The establishment and maintenance of embryonic determination                    and differential patterns of gene expression is essential for                   normal animal development.  In Drosophila embryonic                             determination is, at least in part, under the control of the                    selector genes of the bithorax and Antennapedia complexes.  I                   have been studying a genetic region, referred to as the                         PAS-R, that contains a number of related genes.  The proper                     function of these genes is essential for normal development                     and it appears to be required for the proper regulation of                      selector genes.  This proposal consists of a molecular and                      developmental genetic analysis of the PAS-R.  I propose to                      use classical genetics, in vitro mutagenesis, and germ line                     transformation to rigorously identify individual proteins and                   RNAs with functional genes.  I will sequence cDNA clones                        derived from these genes to determine the amino acid                            sequences of the proteins they encode.  This may tell us                        something about their function, and is valuable information                     for making antibody probes for the proteins.  I propose to                      use both developmental and molecular approaches to identify                     genes whose regulation requires the presence of PAS-R gene                      products.  Experimental systems will be developed that will                     enable us to study this regulation, and to identify                             functional domains of PAS-R proteins and target recognition                     sequences.                                                                                                                                                      The orchestration of gene expression which results in the                       development of an adult is still largely not understood.                        Insight into the function of genes such as those found in the                   PAS-R region which are thought to regulate the expression of                    genes known to be developmentally essential should result                       from this study.",
