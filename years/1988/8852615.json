 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular and Cellular Biology are viewed by this department as            the primary instrumentation courses offered to majors.  These courses           are being integrated into a two-semester sequence, and have an                  extensive laboratory component located in a new molecular biology               laboratory.  Instruments with three experimental capabilities are being         added or upgraded in order to maximize the effectiveness of students'           experience:  (a)  polarographic equipment,  (b)  an ELISA plate reader          and  (c)  equipment for quantitative assessment of gel electrophoresis          runs utilizing photography, densitometry and autoradiography.                                                                                                        A quality laboratory experience should provide students with               opportunities to do quantitative work as opposed to mere exercises for          illustrating the principle or mechanism of a specific technique.  This          equipment permits a sophisticated level of hands-on experimentation,            introducing students to the current concepts, terminology and                   techniques of the field.  In addition to strengthening the Molecular            and Cellular Biology courses, the instrumentation is enhancing                  laboratory work in Immunology, Endocrinology and Genetics, and                  significantly broadening the scope of Directed Student Research                 offered as part of the Biology curriculum.                                                                                                                           The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
