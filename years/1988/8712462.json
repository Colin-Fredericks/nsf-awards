 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Dr. Richard R. Perez, State University of New            York at Albany, to collaborate with Dr. Pierre Ineichen, University             of Geneva, Switzerland, on solar radiation modeling.  They will try             to improve and validate methods, developed by them, for modeling the            sky diffuse and ground reflected irradiance received by tilted                  surfaces.  Additionally, they will model the relationships between              visible and total components of solar radiation reaching the earth's            surface.                                                                                                                                                        Model validations require large data sets covering a broad climatic             range.  The researchers will share their information from different             locations, and will investigate the effects of environmental                    factors, such as local aerosol contents, on the models'                         configurations and performance.  The collaboration will extend the              scope of both investigators' research, and will allow them to                   formulate needed recommendations for measurement and modeling                   techniques.  Improving irradiance and illumination efficiency models            and gaining an increased understanding of ground-reflected radiation            are important to the international building, energy, and lighting               research communities.   The project brings together and                         significantly enhances complementary domestic research projects of              the American and Swiss investigators.",
