 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides for equipment to support current and future               research on two classes of aerospace structures, rotorcraft and                 spacecraft.  The general rotorcraft research addresses vibratory                rotor loads and rotor impedance measurements, general rotor-airframe            stability testing, and general rotor-airframe vibration testing.                Tests for specific rotor types are addressed as well.  These include            aeroelastic stability tests, vibration characterization tests, and              tail cone vibration tests. For spacecraft structures research, a                scaled portion of a space structure, representative of a space                  structure, will be tested to validate finite element analysis                   techniques.  The equipment provided completes two test facilities               under construction at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, a model rotor           impedance test facility, and a shake test facility.  A power drive              system and support pylon, an articulated drive shaft assembly, and              supplementary data acquisition equipment are provided for the first             facility.  Transducers and other hardware as well as signal                     processing, modal analysis and data reduction equipment are provided            for the second facility.",
