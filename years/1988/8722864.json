 "awd_abstract_narration": "Masonry construction comprises a large portion of building                      construction in the U.S. and the world.  Reinforced masonry                     construction use is increasing in moderate to higher seismic zones              because of its apparent features of economy, fire safety,                       architectural flexibility and ease of construction.  The present state          of masonry structural analysis and design, and materials and                    construction technologies does not enable an accurate prediction of             building behavior under lateral loads such as seismic loads.  In the            U.S., masonry buildings are designed and built with methods, codes and          standards that rely upon a mixture of working stress methods,                   empirical rules, and questionable methods for determining allowable             stress values.  Masonry is also a complex building material because of          the large number of design and construction variables which influence           the final product configuration and its response under seismic loads.           In order to describe the seismic response of masonry buildings it is            necessary to develop the fundamental knowledge base to determine basic          design methodologies consistent with safety and economic requirements.                                                                                          This research project is a theoretical and experimental investigation           of the seismic performance of flanged masonry shear walls.  The                 theoretical studies develop predictive models for effective flange              width under lateral loading and also develop                                    load-displacement component models for lateral hysteretic                       response that incorporates the separate displacement components                 resulting from flexure, shear and base-slip deformation.                        Particular emphasis is placed on the asymmetrical strength,                     stiffness, and ductility characteristics of T-section walls                     loaded parallel to their web.  The experimental studies involve                 static cyclic load testing of T-section masonry walls and dynamic               shake-table testing of T-section and rectangular section walls.                 The tests are on full-scale elements and are used to verify and                 calibrate the models developed during theoretical studies.  This                project is part of the U.S.-Japan Coordinated Program for Masonry               Building Research and the Technical Coordinating Committee for                  Masonry Research (TCCMAR) Program.",
