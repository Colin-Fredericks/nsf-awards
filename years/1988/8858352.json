 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program will focus on low temperature, photo-enhanced chemical             vapor deposition techniques to achieve single crystal epitaxy.  Non-            selective photo-excitation using a low pressure mercury lamp, as well           as selective epitaxy using an ArF excimer laser will be used coupled            with rapid thermal processing using incoherent arc lamps to rapidly             adjust the substrate temperature during growth.  Two materials                  systems to be studied using this growth technique include silicon N-            i-P-i doping superlattices and Si-SixGe1-x strained layer                       superlattices/pseudomorphic layers.  These systems will be examined             from the viewpoint of novel device applications.  They are,                     respectively, electroptic modulation using the tunable bandgap                  properties of N-i-P-i superlattices and the possibility of obtaining            direct bandgap superlattices using a combination of Brillouin zone              folding and lattice strain in the Si-SixGe1-x strained layer system.            We believe a photo-enhanced CVD technique has significant potential             advantages over competing growth techniques.  It does not require               ultra high vacuum conditions as in MBE.  It allows selective                    excitation of precursor species, allowing better crystalline quality            with less contamination than plasma-CVD.  Substrate temperatures can            be lowered compared to MOCVD.  In conclusion, excellent                         heterostructures with abrupt interfaces and doping profiles should be           achievable by photo-enhanced CVD to allow novel device applications             using compositional and doping superlattices.",
