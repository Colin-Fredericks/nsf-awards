 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Julian Steyermark of the Missouri Botanical Garden, with            assistance from numerous U.S. and Venezuelan collaborators, will                complete a descriptive inventory of the estimated 8500 species of               flowering plants and ferns of the Venezuelan Guayana, a region of               sandstone mountains and intervening valleys and plains across the               northern rim of the Amazon basin.  The richness of this flora is                shown by the fact that half the species are endemic to the                      region, known nowhere else in the world.  Since the first                       explorations of this region, made famous by Conan Doyle's stories               of \"Lost World,\" numerous expeditions have brought back thousands               of unusual and outstanding plants, described in numerous                        publications.  However, no single comprehensive work on the flora               of this unique region has ever been published.  By amassing all                 this information into one complete account, the resulting work                  will provide an essential and important reference for use by                    ecologists, foresters, conservationists, agriculturists,                        biogeographers, and taxonomists.  Not only will it contain                      information, whenever possible, on the medicinal and other uses                 of the species, as well as inclusion of the Spanish and Indian                  tribal names, but it will include nearly 4000 illustrations of                  plants, most of them never previously published.  The text will                 also include keys for identification, notes on plant habit and                  ecological habitats, elevational ranges, and geographical                       distributions, both within and beyond Venezuela.  The resulting                 work should be an outstanding contribution to botanical science.",
