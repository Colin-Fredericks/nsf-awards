 "awd_abstract_narration": "Michael Gage will continue his research on curve shortening                problems. These questions ask for information on the asymptotic                 behavior of a curve, in the plane or in a surface, which is                     evolving according to its curvature. For example this situation                 would occur if an elastic curve were allowed to slide in a                      surface. The techniques to be applied are a mixture of analysis                 and geometry. Many of the problems will find applications in the                evolution of vortex filaments in fluid dynamics and wave fronts                 in excitable media.                                                                  Gage's immediate goals are the study of the curve shortening               problem on complete surfaces with bounded Gauss curvature; the                  analysis of the curve shortening flow for locally convex immersed               curves; and the analysis of the size of the blow up set for the                 curvature. He will also study related flows. In particular these                include area preserving curve shortening processes and higher                   dimensional analogues in which curves are replaced by                           hypersurfaces.",
