 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of nine US researchers in a               joint seminar with Beijing University on a social science research              program for the International Geosphere/Biosphere Program (IGBP).               The IGBP is an effort of the International Council of Scientific                Unions (ICSU) to \"describe and understand the interactive physical,             chemical, and biological processes that regulate the total Earth                system, the unique environment that it provides for life, the                   changes that are occurring in this system, and the manner in which              they are influenced by human actions.\"                                                                                                                          This seminar will focus on the development of a social science                  research program to complement the IGBP.   The social processes that            account for change in human activities are less well understood than            many important natural phenomena and modeling of them is even more              limited. The joint efforts of China and the US to contribute to the             definition of a research program  in the social sciences to                     contribute to the IGBP could be one of the first steps toward                   definition of an international research program which is responsive             to the needs of all countries, both developed and developing, as                well as to the specific national needs of China and the US.  This               seminar is being supported jointly by NSF and the Chinese State                 Education Commission under the Protocol on Cooperation in Basic                 Sciences.",
