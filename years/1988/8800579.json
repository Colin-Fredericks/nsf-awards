 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current attempts to study life history evolution have begun                to focus on multiple causality: demography, behavior, physiology,               biophysics, and ecology all interact to shape life history                      phenotypes.  Emphasis has been placed on evaluating energetic,                  behavioral, and environmental factors, within a demographic                     context, in an attempt to generate testable predictions from life               history theories.  Accordingly, the effects of different soil                   moisture potentials and temperatures on hatchability, hatchling                 size (mass and length), and development time in the iguanid                     lizard, Sceloporus merriami will be evaluated.  This will be                    integrated with the particular pattern of female territoriality                 and home range use seen in these animals.  Females aggressively                 defend their territories from males and other females, while                    males direct their defense against other males.  Yet for either                 sex, territories appear to be inherited en bloc.  Furthermore,                  specific territories are \"hot spots\", where the inhabitants                     invariably live far longer than the average cohort generation                   time.  Additionally, both large males and large females have more               eggs and larger males tend to control more females.  Factors                    affecting size should, then, be important.  This integrated                     approach allows behavior (territoriality), physiology and                       biophysics (egg requirements), and demography, to be evaluated in               an integrated manner with regard to lifetime reproductive                       success.                                                                             Any attempt to evaluate minimum areas required to maintain                 breeding populations of reptiles needs to employ the above                      multiple causality approach.  Such considerations are becoming                  pivotal to conservation attempts to maintain and restock rare or                valuable species.  In a very extreme conservation measure, data                 generated by the above approach can be used to captive-breed                    decimated populations to use as seed stock in the wild.",
