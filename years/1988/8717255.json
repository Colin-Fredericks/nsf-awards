 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will conduct studies on the larger-                   scale dynamics of circulations within and coupled to frictional                 boundary layers.  One primary emphasis will be on planetary zonal               scales in the tropical half of the global atmosphere.  Synoptic                 scales and oceanic motions will be secondary themes.  The                       approaches will be theoretical, modeling, and observational.                    Strong connections to GARP and TOGA programs will be maintained.                                                                                                     Theoretical studies will have two areas of concentration.                  One will be on dynamic structures of balanced flows, with                       implications for three-dimensional data analysis strategies.                    Another will be on unbalanced systems, such as cross-equatorial                 winds, boundary-layer spin-down circulations, forced waves, and                 the Tibetan Plateau effect.                                                                                                                                          Observational studies will use the unique GARP data.  Two                  results on turbulent monsoonal flow in MONEX will be completed.                 FGGE data will be used to determine the dynamics of cross                       equatorial flow and air-sea momentum interactions.  Modeling work               will be a means to develop a TOGA (Tropical Ocean-Global                        Atmosphere) climate program perspective in this grant.  A three-                level cumulus boundary layer model will be applied to understand                latitudinal and time variations, and coupled experiments with an                ocean mixed layer will be conducted.  Improvements in the model                 will include higher resolution with more realistic effects of                   wind shear.                                                                                                                                                          This research is important to advances in understanding how                the earth's planetary boundary layer influences weather and                     climate and in modeling and predicting weather and climate.",
