 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to generate theories and                       techniques for a computer-based system that will assist in                      creating mechanical designs that meet their function, cost, and                 quality requirements while simultaneously meeting the constraints               imposed by downstream activities.  The principal investigators                  will create a design system that fuses the functional                           requirements of a mechanical design with the constraints that are               imposed on the design throughout its life-cycle through the use                 of perspectives and features.                                                        This project is founded on three underlying concepts: (1)                  integrating life-cycle concerns through the use of views from                   multiple perspectives, where each perspective represents a                      different life-cycle concern such as manufacture, distribution,                 maintenance, etc.; (2) representing the design space at different               levels of abstraction and granularity through the use of                        features, where features are the attributes that characterize a                 design from the viewpoint of any perspective; and (3) generating                and pruning the design space through the use of constraints.                         Design fusion is the unifying concept that integrates                      these three.  Fundamentally, design fusion combines heuristic                   search and constraint directed reasoning with a robust                          representation based on features so that life-cycle knowledge                   can be used to generate, constrain, and test design decisions.",
