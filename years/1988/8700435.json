The work covers topics in software                     engineering, programming-in-the-large, and real-time processing.                Specifically, the following topics will be addressed.                                                                                                               1.  a module structuring and                                                interface methodology, based on an                                              acyclic graph model where the nodes                                             represent modules (restricted to                                                processes and abstract data types)                                              and the edges denote procedure import                                           and export relations.                                                                                                                                           2.  a prototype for real-time                                                   operating systems design, involving                                             libraries of reusable components.                                               This involves the identification,                                               design, and building of a variety of                                            useful components and structures,                                               such as interrupt handlers, critical                                            section locking mechanisms, message                                             passing, timers, schedulers, input-                                             output systems, cyclic executives,                                              and producer-consumer applications.                                                                                                                             3.  a graphics front end for                                                    interacting with designs. This would                                            permit the construction,                                                        modification, and annotation of our                                             module structures, including the                                                association of modules with their                                               code files.",
