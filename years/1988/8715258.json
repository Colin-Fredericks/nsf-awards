 "awd_abstract_narration": "The collection of mammals at the University of Kansas Museum               of Natural History is the second largest at any U.S. university                 and the fourth largest in North America.  The collection now                    consists of nearly 142,000 catalogued specimens and is world-wide               in scope, with greatest strength in mammals of North and Central                America.                                                                             Use and safety of the collection are hampered by crowding                  and attendant problems of specimen organization, as well as lack                of an up-to-date inventory of specimens.  In addition,                          approximately 10% of the collection is stored in antiquated                     wooden cases that require frequent monitoring to insure that the                specimens are protected from pests.                                                  This project will provide support to: 1) purchase additional               cases to replaced the antiquated wooden cases and to alleviate                  overcrowding and damage from pests; 2) hire additional personnel                to recurate the collection and accelerate the ongoing capture of                specimen data onto computer files; and 3) purchase and install                  new equipment for specimen preparation.  These enhancements will                allow the mammal collection to begin to address the existing                    problems of space, organization and specimen safety.",
