 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although much of surface-derived matter fluxes to the                   ocean interior and the sea floor in the form of macroscopic                     aggregates known as marine snow, little is known about the                      processes governing the production of these large particles in                  the ocean.  One source of marine snow of potential global                       significance is the mass flocculation and settlement of living                  diatoms following diatom blooms.  While this phenomenon is                      known only inferentially from sediment trap studies and no                      published empirical accounts of marine snow formation by                        diatoms in nature yet exist, the PI has regularly observed,                     using scuba, living diatoms forming abundant aggregates of                      marine snow centimeters in diameter in the Southern California                  Bight.  She has conducted preliminary investigations of the                     species composition and sinking rates of these flocs.  This                     research continues along those lines.                                                   The objectives of this proposal are to:  1) document the                duration, timing, floc abundance and characteristics, and                       impact on vertical flux of diatom flocculation events;  2)                      determine the state, and species composition and abundance,                     associated with marine snow formation by diatoms in nature;                     and  3) investigate the physical and biological mechanisms by                   which diatoms collide and stick to form aggregates.  This                       research will provide the first empirical data on diatom                        aggregation as a significant source of marine snow.  It will                    further our understanding of the mechanisms of large particle                   formation in the ocean necessary to fully understand and                        predict ocean flux .",
