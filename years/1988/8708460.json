 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increased paleobotanical activity of the last several years             is beginning to yield new data and new insights bearing on the                  origin and early diversification of flowering plants during the                 Cretaceous Period, 100 million years ago.  The previous database                used by paleobotanists focused almost entirely upon leaf remains.               New evidence from fossil pollen and fossilized floral and wood                  structures, and new interpretations of leaf anatomy, have greatly               expanded the database.  Dr. Peter Crane of the Field Museum,                    Chicago, will continue this expansion of the sources of data, by                collecting floral remains from rich Cretaceous deposits of the                  Potomac Group of eastern North America.                                                 Detailed descriptive examination of well-preserved floral               material will permit recognition of the major taxonomic groups                  living at this early time in angiosperm history.  Studies of                    flowers with pollen in place will permit integration of the                     extensive dispersed palynological record of early angiosperms                   with the fossil record of other plant organs.  Information on                   floral structure will provide an improved basis for interpreting                the pollination and other biological aspects of the life of early               flowering plants.  Dr. Crane's studies are important in                         developing corroborated hypotheses about the evolutionary                       relationships between major groups of early angiosperms.",
