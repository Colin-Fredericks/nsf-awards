 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Institute for Mathematical Studies in the Social Sciences                   (IMSSS) will hold two month long workshops in the summer of 1988                and the summer of 1989 at Stanford University in order to bring                 together for extended periods of work a large number of the top                 senior and the most promising junior economic theorists.  During                the IMSSS summer workshops an extensive number of formal seminars               and workshops provide the arena for a review and discussion of                  the work of each one of the participants.  The extensive                        interaction among the participants provides the environment for                 generating new ideas which become the basis of their creative                   work during the period that follows the workshop.  In many                      instances the discussion at the workshop provides an evaluation                 of \"the state of the art\" and some workshop publications have                   been very influential in setting the stage for the scientific                   developments to follow.                                                                                                                                         The IMSSS selects basic \"themes\" which unify most of the                        activities of each summer.  In the summer of 1988, the two                      central themes will be: (1) The Economics of Organization and (2)               Learning and Expectation Formation.  Two one-day workshops will                 also be held on the economics of organization and on positive                   political economy.  The central themes for the summer of 1989                   will be selected in August 1988.  Two themes will be selected                   from the following: (1) Bounded Rationality, (2) Incomplete                     Markets and Macro-economic Phenomena, (3) Contracts and (4)                     Alternative Theories of Unemployment.",
