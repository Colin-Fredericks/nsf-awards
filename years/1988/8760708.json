 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent amendments to the Animal Welfare Act call for provision of               physical environments promoting the psychological well-being of                 non-human primates.  Criteria for evaluating the success of                     changes intended to promote psychological well-being are not                    defined.  No means for implementing such changes are specified.                 This lack of definition and specificity is especially problematic               for research facilities where use of infectious agents requires                 contained housing, or where experimental protocols do not allow                 animals to roam freely.                                                                                                                                         In studying the psychological well-being of non-human primates,                 an array of enrichment strategies may be examined.  From this                   array, it may be possible to select and develop systems that will               provide social enrichment for a particular species.                                                                                                             This Small Business Innovation Research project is to determine                 the feasibility of a program in which systems for primate                       environmental enrichment can be developed.  The feasibility study               will result in a plan to assess the value of objective behavioral               criteria for developing enrichment procedures of three basic                    kinds:  food, alternative caging, and implements of diversion or                entertainment.  The Phase I effort will be to specifically review               strategic approaches, create objective behavioral protocols,                    postulate necessary constraints due to a particular animal or                   study, followed by a feasibility statement and recommended                      approaches.                                                                                                                                                     This research has potential for commercial application through                  patents on new caging design, playthings, stimulus enhancers and                foods.  A secondary application is that methods of environmental                enrichment would help in the defense of the use of primates for                 research in the face of mounting pressures from animal-rights                   activists.",
