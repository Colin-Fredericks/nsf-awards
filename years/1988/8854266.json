 "awd_abstract_narration": "The advent of powerful microcomputers and the development of Computer           Algebra Systems (CASs) has set mathematics on a revolutionary course,           providing the potential for one of the most important and beneficial            changes in undergraduate mathematics curricula in decades.  Despite the         importance of CASs, most undergraduate mathematics teachers have little         or no experience with computers as a teaching tool.  There is a need            for \"hands-on\" introductions to CAS to prepare teachers to use CASs in          their classroom, and to seed new initiatives.  A number of Colleges,            Colby among them, have been experimenting in the use of CASs through            the help of grants from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.  The project            director of the present program, in conjunction with an Advisory Group          of experts, will design and offer an intensive series of ten two-day            workshops and five extended five-day summer workshops.  Using CAS as a          teaching tool requires restructuring the calculus curriculum in terms           of both content and topic emphasis.  Thus, the primary result of this           program will be curriculum development.  It is anticipated that out of          this workshop series 200 teachers will be introduced to CAS at a                serious level;  125 will gain experience in developing a calculus CAS           curriculum and be prepared to use CASs in their courses; 15-20 people           will become experienced CAS workshop instructors and consultants: 325           teachers will receive current CAS curriculum materials; 340 teachers            will be involved in several hours of curriculum discussion and                  development; and a network of several hundred CAS users will be                 established.  The project will plan and present the workshops at                institutions around the country, and it will significantly influence            the further development and implementation of a major reform in the             teaching of mathematics.                                                                                                                                        In addition to grant funds, participants' institutions will provide an          additional 30% in travel expenses.",
