 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to study the home processes                related to children's interest and proficiency in mathematics,                  and to assess the extent to which these processes are changed                   through a program designed to help parents become more effective                partners in their children's mathematics learning.  The project                 will focus on families in FAMILY MATH programs across the                       country, specifically: low-income, inner-city minority and                      majority families in the San Francisco Bay Area; Hispanics                      (through Valle del Sol in Arizona); American Indians (through the               Oregon Indian Education Association); and urban blacks (through                 the Urban League in Indianapolis, Indiana).  Over 200 families                  will be included in the study.                                                       Research questions posed for this study are:  How does                     FAMILY MATH influence the parents' confidence, and competence as                partners in their children's learning?  How does participation in               the program change the families; math-related activities?  Do                   parents increase their involvement in their children's formal                   mathematics learning?  To what degree does participation in the                 program affect children's school mathematics learning?                               The study has implications for future research on the                      factors influencing student achievement in mathematics, as it                   will help us understand how families can be an important resource               in our efforts to improve student interest and competence in                    mathematics.  Results will help us understand how home processes                are different in special minority groups, what differences in                   patterns of change we might realistically expect when working                   with these special groups, and how programs might be modified to                become more effective in communities where the children's needs                 for a \"better chance\" in mathematics education are particularly                 great.",
