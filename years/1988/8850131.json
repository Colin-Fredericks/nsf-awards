 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"It's Analytical My Dear Watson|\" promises participants an intense              multi-disciplinary experience in forensic chemistry, scientific                 ethics, psychology, criminalistics, and criminology.  A group of                fifteen junior and senior high school students will be selected with            the assistance of local high school science teachers and counselors and         will reflect the ethnic, racial, and economic composition of rural              communities on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.  The Forensic Science             Project will meet on the campus of Washington College for a two week            summer residential program.                                                                                                                                     A staged crime constitutes our opening statement.  Our expert in                eyewitness testimony and the effects of discredited witnesses on jurors         will lead students through a description of the crime and the                   difficulties and ethical problems posed by their flawed perception of           the event.  Lecture sessions will provide the theory of \"wet\" and               instrumental analytical methods and pose the chemical and criminal              puzzles, but more time will be spend in the laboratory.  We will begin          with fingerprinting and blood typing working up to the use of the               Chemistry Departments's phalanx of research grade instrumentation.              These high schoolers will gather data for the growing Chemical                  Analytical Network, a computer simulation in Forensic Chemistry at              Washington College.                                                                                                                                             We will visit crime and environmental laboratories where these young,           open minds can observe potential role models working in exciting and            rewarding fields.  A representative of the Walters Art Gallery will             speak to fakes and forgeries in the art world as demonstrated in a              recent exhibit there.  The course will build to a trial in which                students will serve as expert witnesses, attempting to convince the             judge and jury of the correctness of their forensically gathered                evidence.",
