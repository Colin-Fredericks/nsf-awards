 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is concerned with a theoretical study on upset forging            of cylinders which is used to determine the material formability.               The latter is normally based on a strain criterion  which cannot                correlate all observed failure modes. Dr. Lee will use the more                 realistic porous plasticity, which is based on void nucleation,                 growth and coalescence, in a finite element model to simulate upset             forging.  Detailed histories of stress and strain distributions as              well as the evolution of void growth will be used to predict the                failure modes.  The theoretical results will be evaluated against               existing numerical and experimental results. The important material             and processing variables thus identified will then be used to predict           the failures of other metal-forming processes, such as forging,                 extrusion and rolling. Although young, Dr. Lee is most likely to                succeed in meeting his research objectives at this Predominantly                Undergraduate Institution.",
