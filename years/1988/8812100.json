 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 1980s saw the first sustained and systematic studies of                     agricultural research ethics in the U.S.  These studies have                    been successful in delimiting the normative dimensions of the                   field, establishing that concerns for productivity, tradeoffs,                  constraints, and sustainability are defining characteristics.                   Some empirical work has been done, in case studies, interviews                  and surveys, to delineate determinants and outcomes of research                 choices.  This project will break new ground by integrating an                  assessment of the normative critiques with an analysis of ways                  working agricultural scientists might incorporate lessons from                  those critiques into the planning and administration of their                   ongoing research activities.  A group of eight faculty, five                    from agricultural sciences, engineering and administration and                  three from social science and philosophy, comprise the core                     research team.  This group will meet weekly or biweekly during                  the course of the project at background study sessions where                    papers and topics relevant to the research agenda will be                       discussed.  It will analyse and contrast alternative values for                 agricultural research by conducting a series of four workshops                  with commissioned papers from agricultural and social                           scientists and scholars in the humanities, focusing on ethical                  dimensions of research goals and choices.  After comment and                    revision, final papers from the workshops will be gathered for                  publication in a volume edited by the principal investigators.                  To identify lessons for the planning and administration of                      research, the core group will develop cases and analyse their                   goals and value implications in monthly reporting sessions at                   which agricultural scientists will take the lead in discussing                  on-going research activities.  Other interested faculty are                     expected to attend many of the group sessions.  The results of                  these analyses will be prepared for publication in appropriate                  agriculture journals as well as journals directed to the                        science and technology studies community.  Two graduate                         research assistants will assist in developing and leading group                 sessions, keeping substantive records of the meetings as well                   as the workshop discussions, and in developing annotated                        bibliographies for the field.                                                                                                                                   This complex project is of intrinsic and practical importance.                  The investigators and team members are uniquely qualified and                   very well positioned to undertake the research; institutional                   support is very good and the institutional setting increases                    the likelihood that results will have impact.  The project is                   designed well and plans for the dissemination of results are                    good.  It is likely that follow-on efforts will continue after                  the period of this award.  The Cooperative States Research                      Service of the Department of Agriculture is helping to support                  this project.",
