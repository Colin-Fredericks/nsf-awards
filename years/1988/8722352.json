 "awd_abstract_narration": "They plan a number of projects which aim at increasing their                    understanding of surface and interfacial magnetism and, at the                  same time, laying a foundation for the development of new                       magnetic materials which might prove important in data storage                  applications.  They intend to continue their work on                            (110)iron/(111)silver heterostructures and superlattices, taking                full advantage of their RHEED facilities.  In all cases it is                   necessary to do careful studies to determine whether clean,                     epitaxial interfaces, without significant alloying can be                       produced.  They have shown that they can produce excellent silver               substrates in their MBE apparatus by deposition of silver on                    polished silver single crystals.  They can now do Conversion-                   Electron Mossbauer spectroscopy on such heterostructure samples.                They also propose to use their MBE system to grow superconducting               copper perovskites on appropriate single crystal substrates.                    They expect to use a multiple cell effusion system which also                   permits oxygen effusion.  They hope to be able to produce films                 which may depart from the normal 1-2-3 phase and which show                     significantly enhanced Tc over the bulk samples which they now                  grow.  Attention will be paid to the development of thin film                   ceramic technology important to the application of these                        materials as sensors and superconducting computer elements.                     Doping of samples with 57iron to permit Mossbauer spectroscopic                 examination of the copper sites is also planned.",
