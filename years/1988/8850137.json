 "awd_abstract_narration": "A science career awareness institute at Old Dominion University will            offer motivated students in grades 9, 10, and 11 the opportunity to             explore a variety of careers involving applications of physics.                 Emphasis will be placed on careers in applied physics, engineering              (civil, electrical and mechanical), physical oceanography, chemistry,           astronomy, computer science and mathematics, and science education.             This four-week summer residential program (with an academic year                follow-up) will; (1) provide class room enrichment experiences to               enhance the knowledge of participants in applied physics and (2)                foster meaningful interactions between participants and practitioners           in the areas of applied physics in lab activities, group discussions,           etc. Groups such as women and minorities that are underrepresented in           science will have the opportunity to interact with role models who are          scientists and engineers.  This project will enhance participant                appreciation for science, provide guidance in career planning, and help         participants assess their potential for success in fields involving             applications of physics.",
