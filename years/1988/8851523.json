 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to provide Natural Resources Management           students with a sequential program of computerized data collection,             monitoring, analysis and presentation of synthesized resource and               climatic information.  Implementation of this program dramatically              improves the Natural Resources Management curriculum by providing               state-of-the-art computer equipment, and the opportunity for \"hands-on\"         application of resource management principles with \"real-time\" analysis         and interpretation.                                                                                                                                                  Equipment being purchased through this project include geographic          information system hardware (including a digitizer, a color terminal,           and plotter), hand-held data logger computers, micro-computer                   workstations, and a computer projection system for classroom                    demonstration.  This project is vital to the Natural Resources                  Management curriculum as it provides the opportunity for undergraduates         to be exposed and to develop a working understanding of today's                 technology as currently used by professionals in both industry and              government agencies.                                                                                                                                                 The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
