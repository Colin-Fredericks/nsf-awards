 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematicians at Washington State University will develop,                     coordinate, and write multi-disciplined computer-based curriculum               materials for calculus to be implemented at two high schools, a                 community college, a private college and a public university.                   Generic curriculum materials for engineering calculus, calculus                 for life sciences, and business calculus will be developed by                   faculty from engineering, biology, chemistry, business and                      sociology.                                                                                                                                                      The materials will include \"laboratory\" exercises that use                      computing devices such as HP-28 and microcomputers using symbolic               manipulation programs.  These realistic problems will use                       numerical methods that illustrate the power, difficulties and                   logic of computation and graphical solution to problems.                                                                                                        Electronic \"slide shows\" with both animated and static computer                 graphics of classroom demonstrations and lectures will also be                  developed.                                                                                                                                                      The principal investigators are well known researchers, who have                wide range experience in mathematics education.  They will work                 closely with Pullman and Moscow High Schools, Spokane Falls                     Community College and Gonzaga University.",
