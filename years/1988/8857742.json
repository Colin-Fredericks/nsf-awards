 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary research interest of this investigation include the                 fundamental limits to the high speed response of optoelectronic                 devices and inventing ways to surpass those limits.  Specifically, the          first priority will be to demonstrate the first colliding pulse mode            (CPM) locked semiconductor laser.  Recently, the PYI and a UCSB                 graduate student demonstrated a ten times reduction (to 560fs) in               the shortest pulses ever obtained from an actively mode locked                  laser.  Based on this research, it is felt that further reduction in            pulse width is possible.                                                                                                                                        Other related interests include the study and demonstration of high             speed semiconductor lasers, modulators and photodetectors, capable              of modulation at 16 Gbits/s and perhaps even higher bit rates.                  Specifically the investigator is involved in the integration of                 superlattice waveguide photodetectors with coplanar striplines to               demonstrate shorter impulse responses than has ever been previously             demonstrated in PIN or Schottky photodetectors, and simultaneously              to solve the bandwidth-efficiency product problem that is supposedly            inherent to such structures.",
