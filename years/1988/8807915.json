 "awd_abstract_narration": "The experimental plan is to characterize the grain boundary                chemistry of a series of Nb-bearing nickel alloys and then melt                 and resolidify these boundaries using a rapid heating and cooling               cycle typical of a tungsten-arc weld.  The liquid chemistry,                    liquid phase distribution (LPD), and volume fraction of liquid                  will be determined at selected temperatures during heating and                  cooling.  The solidification behavior of the liquid will be                     characterized in terms of its eutectic or solidus temperature and               its terminal solidification products, typically a Laves phase.                  The deviation of this behavior from equilibrium will be                         determined by comparison to isothermal treatments.  The hot                     cracking susceptibility will be determined by measuring the nil                 ductility temperature using a hot ductility test.                                    The proposed research will provide information on several                  fundamental and technical issues.  It will show how the LPD                     evolves during the nonequilibrium stage cooling and how the                     thermal cycle dictates the LPD through its control of diffusion.                It will identify the role of grain boundary chemistry on                        intergranular liquid phase chemistry, liquid phase volume                       fraction, and LPD.  It will also show the correlation of these to               intergranular hot cracking in nickel alloys such as 718, a                      critical material in gas turbine jet engines.",
