 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable collaborative research between Dr. Michael               Zeilik of the University of New Mexico and Dr. Edwin Budding of                 the Carter Observatory, New Zealand.  They will investigate the                 manifestations of magnetic activity in selected sunlike stars by                parallel programs of careful photometric observations and                       phenomenological analysis of the data.  The observations will be                carried out by a tended automated photometric telescope sited in                New Zealand.                                                                                                                                                    Implementation of a tended automated photometric telescope in New               Zealand will initiate a patrol of active stars in the Southern                  Hemisphere complementary to the observation programs already                    underway at various Northern Hemisphere observatories.  Data from               the telescope will yield insight into the patterns of stellar                   activity and how they compare and contrast to those seen in the                 sun.  Dr. Budding brings to the project the resources of the                    Carter Observatory in New Zealand and his own expertise in the                  modeling of starspot light curves.  Dr. Zeilik has been involved                in the implementation of tended automated photometric telescope                 systems at Northern Hemisphere sites.",
