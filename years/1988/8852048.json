 "awd_abstract_narration": "A curriculum in cellular and molecular biology has been under              development in this department for two years.  The purpose is to                provide a program which affords an option in cellular and molecular             biology to departmental majors, supports other intra- and inter-                departmental programs, and provides a background for students                   interested in doing undergraduate research in these areas.                                                                                                           Recent developments include approval of an introductory course in          molecular biology for sophomore students and the restructuring of               existing courses.  The tabletop ultracentrifuge provided through this           award was needed to carry out laboratory exercises essential to the             program, support student research projects and to provide practical             experiences that reinforce pedagogical material covered in lectures.            The tabletop model not only is suitable for all these uses, it also is          less expensive to purchase and maintain, requires lower expenditures            for materials, and is both easy and safe to use.                                                                                                                     The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
