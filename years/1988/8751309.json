 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project responds to increasing national concern about the                  low levels of participation and achievement of inquiry skills                   among women and non-Asian minorities in mathematics.  Activities                will include the design of an instructional approach that                       combines an inquiry-based mathematics curriculum with cooperative               small-group learning.  It will test the effects of the combined                 instructional approach on the mathematics achievement, attitudes,               and future plans of low-income Hispanic middle school students.                 The major focus will be on students' ability to solve problems in               mathematics and their participation in classroom problem-solving                activities.                                                                                                                                                     The project will be carried out in three phases: (1) the effects                of inquiry-based instruction on development of inquiry skills                   will be tested; (2) a cooperative learning component will added                 to the classroom activities; and (3) students will be trained to                increase their involvement and participation in classroom                       activities.                                                                                                                                                     The results of this project will be significant in a number of                  ways: it is the first attempt to design and systematically test                 combined inquiry-based and cooperative learning approaches to                   mathematics curriculum and instruction; it has the potential of                 creating more optimal learning opportunities for low                            socioeconomic Hispanic students; it has potential for improving                 the inquiry skills of all students; and the intervention                        strategies to be developed have potential for motivating students               to continue their education in mathematics and the sciences.",
