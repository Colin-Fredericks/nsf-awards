 "awd_abstract_narration": "Suctorian ciliates and their ciliated prey display remarkable cell-cell         recognition and interaction phenomena.  Prey are recognized by                  receptors located on the knob of the predator's tentacle.  The prey are         recognized through components of their cilia.  The proposed work will           utilize the predator Discophrya collini, and its prey, Tetrahymena.             This is a system which is easily manipulated experimentally.  The prey          protein(s) that are recognized will be identified by monoclonal                 antibody technology, and characterized biochemically and                        ultrastructurally.  Related prey species will be tested for cross-              reactivity.  The results will provide the crucial first step in                 dissecting, at the molecular level, this cell-cell recognition                  phenomenon.                                                                                                                                                     The work constitutes a clever and potentially useful model system for           exploring cell-cell recognition phenomena at the molecular level.               Insights gained from this project may well turn out to be applicable to         cell-cell recognition phenomena in other systems, including higher              organisms.",
