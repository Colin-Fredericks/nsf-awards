 "awd_abstract_narration": "Texas Regional Enhancement Program for Underprepared Physics Teachers is        a model regional cooperative program to provide training in physics             content and pedagogy for 24 underprepared high school physics teachers          from the State of Texas.  Three two-week summer workshops covering              topics in classical, modern, and contemporary physics will be offered           during the three year grant period.  Academic year follow-up meetings           and classroom visitations also are included to provide assistance with          implementation and evaluation.  Instruction in the program is carried           out by a team consisting of highly experienced high school physics              teachers (Physics Teaching Resource Agents) and a university faculty            member.  Participants will receive three units of graduate credit for           successful completion of each year of the program.",
