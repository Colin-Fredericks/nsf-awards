 "awd_abstract_narration": "Laboratory exercises for various courses are being developed to            illustrate underlying biological principles related to major health             problems in Black Americans.  These activities include electrophoresis          of normal and sickle cell hemoglobin, fluorescent antibody                      demonstration of proteins associated with Graves disease and sickle             cell patients, cardiovascular system activities related to hypertension         in Black Americans, and biochemical tests to illustrate diabetes,               lactose intolerance, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)               deficiency.                                                                                                                                                          Four student stations for electrophoresis experiments,                     biochemical studies and microscopic work are being set up.  In                  addition, two analytical balances, two pH meters, two variable speed            centrifuges, one inverted phase microscope, one fluorescent phase video         microscope for class demonstration, and one transfer hood are being             installed.  Capabilities for the hypertension studies already are               available.  The project motivates all students, especially minorities,          to maintain their efforts in pursuing a biomedically-related career.            In addition, the laboratory activities developed will be made available         as a laboratory manual for other institutions.                                                                                                                       The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
