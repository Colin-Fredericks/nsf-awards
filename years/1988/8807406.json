 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first area of this proposed research addresses the fundamentals of          silica fouling.  It includes research on the chemical kinetics of               silica fouling, the measurement of transient local and overall fouling          thermal resistance on a heat exchanger surface and the analytical               modeling of the solubility and silica fouling of brines containing              multi-component dissolved salts.  The other major subject of research           pertains to silica fouling prevention by magnetic means.  Magnetic              effects on silica fouling will be investigated by an array of                   alternative means.  They include optical transmission, solubility,              polymerization, silica scale formation on heat exchanger surface and            direct measurement of in-situ residual magnetization in brines, all             aiming to reveal basic mechanism and effectiveness of magnetic anti-            scale devices.                                                                                                                                                  Silica is an abundant material in nature and exists in large amounts            in underground geothermal reservoirs.  When the underground water is            utilized, as in geothermal power systems, the dissolved silica will             precipitate out and deposit on heat exchanger surfaces, forming a               thermal insulating fouling layer and reducing the overall heat                  exchanger efficiency with severe economical and technical                       consequences.  The present research aims to study under what                    conditions silica fouling will occur and why it does occur.  The other          objective is to investigate the effectiveness of silica fouling                 prevention by anti-scale magnetic field devices.  The success of the            proposed research will greatly improve the efficiency of heat                   exchangers involving underground water and will expedite a greater              utilization worldwide of geothermal energy for power generation.",
