 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fast and accurate characterization of parallel computers is essential           in finding their suitability for different applications.  The thrust of         the proposed research is to analyze and evaluate the dependability and          performance issues of two promising classes of parallel computers.              These are multistage interconnection network (MIN) systems and                  hypercube systems.                                                                                                                                              The research is aimed at developing complete system models considering          the degradation of both computing elements and communication network.           Various dependability and performance measures, applicable in the               domain of parallel processing, are used to characterize these                   architectures.  Analytical/simulation/hybrid models are being developed         to compute the dependability and performance-related dependability              parameters for both repairable and non-repairable systems.  The                 analytical models are based on approximate techniques and Markovian             approach.  The Markov model will be implemented as a program package to         study the transient and steady state behavior of these systems.  While          the structure of the package will be somewhat similar to those of CARE          III/HARP, it will have additional features such as automatic state              generation and performance prediction.  A major contribution of this            research will be the availability of a set of tools that can be used            for the evaluation of some of the existing and evolving parallel                architectures.",
