 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops the theoretical framework for the study of                feedback stabilization and control problems associated with                     constrained mechanical systems.  A controller which achieves certain            performance objectives for an unconstrained mechanical system may be            unsuited if external constraints are imposed.  The work is strongly             motivated by important engineering problems associated with robots              and space systems.  The constraint arises when contact is made                  between bodies.  In robotics, this occurs when there is contact                 between end effectors and payload objects.  For example, such                   operations as contour following, deburring, fastening, and pick and             place fall within this class.  For space systems, constraints arise             in satellite docking maneuvers.  Constrained robot problems have been           the motivation for much recent research in compliance and impedance             control, but always without explicit consideration of contact forces            required to maintain satisfaction of the constraints.  The research             makes substantial use of mathematical methods for nonlinear analysis            of dynamic systems.  Computer simulation experiments will be                    performed to verify the theory developed and to suggest new                     theoretical issues for study.  The example to be simulated and                  investigated comprises a particle constrained to move on a smooth               elliptic wire.  The theory may also be tested experimentally on an              instrumented x-y table.",
