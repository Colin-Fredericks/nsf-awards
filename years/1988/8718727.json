 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed neuroanatomical and electrophysiological study of                  the major flight muscles of birds is designed to provide data                   relevant to 1) the evolution of neuromuscular design among                      tetrapods, and 2) the recruitment of motor motoneuron and muscle                unit (contraction speed, force production, fatigability)                        properties of functionally isolated motor units from the major                  depressor (pectoralis) and elevator (supracoracoideus) muscles of               the wing.  Glycogen depletion techniques will permit description                of innervation ratio and peripheral distribution patterns of each               unit type, as well as provide the first histochemical-                          physiological correlation for muscle fibers in avian flight                     muscles.  The distribution and general morphology of the motor                  nuclei within the spinal cord for each of these muscles will be                 established with an anatomical tracer (horseradish peroxidase).                 The significance of expected results is as follows:  First,                     Goslow's hypothesis that throughout the evolution of diverse                    locomotor systems among tetrapods, the neural control mechanism                 for tetrapod shoulder function during locomotion has remained                   relatively conservative will be evaluated by examining the                      neuromuscular organization.  Second, within the pectoralis of                   pigeons during flight, recruitment between two muscle fiber                     species appears to be consistent with the \"size principle.\"                     However, theory of muscle fiber mechanics and efficiency suggests               that the recruitment order in populations of aerobic fibers (80%                in pigeons, 100% in starlings) may not be ordered.  The proposed                study offers the first detailed account of the structural and                   functional organization of flight muscle motor units which will                 allow evaluation of these hypotheses.",
