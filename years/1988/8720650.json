 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of the surfaces and interfaces of polymeric materials                 is extremely important in determining structure-property                        relationships relevent to technological applications in adhesion,               coatings, biocompatibility, degradation, and reactivity.  In this               proposal, surface-sensitive measurements of organic and polymeric               surfaces are described, based on sputtering induced by and                      scattering of a primary low-energy noble-gas ion beam.                          Specifically, Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) thin-film preparation                      techniques will be used to control structure, orientation, and                  degree of polymerization of films.  These will be utilized to                   study the ion-formation processes which give rise to information                about the chain length and bonding of a polymeric chain.                        Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) methods will be developed                using the LB film as a model system for the polymer surface, also               SIMS will probe the interfacial chemistry of the films                          themselves.  Low-energy Ion Scattering (ISS) analysis of the                    orientation of ordered polymer surfaces will be studied by                      combining results from molecular mechanics calculations of                      average orientation and compared to experimental results under                  low-damage conditions.  Studies of the surface composition of                   block copolymers, compatible blends, and surface-modified                       polymers will be accomplished by combining electron microscopy,                 contact angle analysis, Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical                      Analysis (angular dependent methods), ISS and Fourier Transform                 Infrared Spectroscopy to get a complete description of the                      surface and dynamics of the polymer interface.",
