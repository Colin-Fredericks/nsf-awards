 "awd_abstract_narration": "The current models of the atmospheric region known as the                  lower thermosphere (80 to 130 km in altitude) are inadequate in                 many respects, and the observational data to test and normalize                 them is quite sparse.  Current efforts are under way to interpret               observations made of the region during the last decade, and to                  obtain new data as part of the CEDAR campaign \"The Lower                        Thermosphere Coupling Study\" (LTCS).  The high altitude energy                  inputs of the solar wind and solar ultraviolet propagate downward               through the region, and the lower altitude tidal and gravity wave               energy inputs propagate upward through it, both depositing some                 of their energy on the way.  To understand the coupling between                 the upper and lower atmosphere we must understand the structure                 and dynamics of the lower thermosphere and how it affects the                   energy propagating through it.  This award is to support a                      modelling project that will take an existing model that covers                  the atmosphere from the surface to 85 km, and extend it up to 130               km.  The transfer of energy by radiation will be treated more                   accurately than has been possible previously, and the project                   should lead to a better understanding of the interactions between               chemistry, radiation, and dynamics in the atmosphere, with                      possible consequences for better understanding of changes in                    weather and climate.",
