 "awd_abstract_narration": "The boric acid-borate system is important in the control of pH                  for certain medicinal preparations and the buffering capacity of                natural waters, as well as in bio- and geo-chemical processes in                brines, ocean, and sea-waters in the temperature range 5 to 90 degrees          centigrade, and in the ionic strength range of 0.01 to 6.0 mols per             kilogram.  The main objectives of this study are (a) to apply the               precise electromotive force method (without liquid junction),                   isopiestic, and densimetric techniques to investigate the effects of            salts on ionization equilibria involving boric acid in sea water; (b)           to provide accurate thermodynamic equilibrium data for aqueous ionic            systems,. e.g., involving Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, Zn, Mn, Co, Ni, and Fe; (c)           to utilize the full Pitzer's formalism in natural water modeling; (d)           to develop consistent ionic interaction models for multicomponent               electrolyte solutions; and (e) to update and extend electrolyte theory          with refined methods leading to new insights into natural waters and            the environment.  An innovative experimental approach will be                   utilized.  This approach is related to ion-pair formation constants of          boric acid with different alkaline earth and transition metallic                cations found in trace quantities in natural waters.                                                                                                            These new experimental data will assist in geochemical calculations in          brines and natural water modeling.  The uniqueness of the project               would be the development of new chemical technology and the                     application of electrolyte thermodynamics in response to the problems           of marine science and needs of social significance.  Equilibrium                thermodynamics of bicarbonate ion-and boron-containing aqueous                  solutions are also of great practical interest in a number of other             engineering and geological situations:  clear brine completion fluids;          boiler water chemistry; chemical oceanography; mineral solubility;              reaction modeling calculations of geochemical brines; aqueous                   speciation and mineral saturation index; the development of                     geochemical models for groundwater systems; water desalination;                 hydrometallurgy; as a soluble and burnable neutron poison in the                coolants of pressurized nuclear reactors; geothermal energy; pH                 standards; oil (tar) sands, and enhanced oil recovery.",
