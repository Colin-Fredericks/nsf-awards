 "awd_abstract_narration": "A program of braodly-based theoretical research into                            superconductivity is proposed, ranging from the microscopic                     description of the superconductive mechanism in high-Tc                         superconductors to the investigation of flux-pinning in high-                   field Niobium-Titanium superconducting magnets.  In the                         microscopic work, the approach is to construct variational                      wavefunctions for the ground and excited states of the two-                     dimensional Hubbard model.  The investigator has recently found                 an expression for the excited states, building on earlier work                  for the ground state.  The energy and other properties of these                 can be evaluated using a numerical technic previously developed                 by the investigator and others.  They also propose to continue to               develop the analytic theory of this model to finite temperatures,               using a recently discovered mapping of the entropy into a well-                 understood statistical mechanical problem.  Further work aimed at               determining the microscopic phase of UPt3 using experimental                    neutron-scattering data as input will be pursued.  Collaboration                with experimental groups at Wisconsin will also continue.  The                  model of granular superconductivity to explain properties of                    weakly-connected superconductors will be explored by numerical                  methods.  Numerical solutions of the Ginsburg-Landau equations                  for different flux-pinning morphologies (experimentally                         determined) will be obtained.. These last two projects will help                to optimize the properties of oxide and Niobium-Titanium magnets.",
