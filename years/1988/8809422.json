 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fluid-phase equilibria for mixtures of water with biochemical               compounds of low volatility, such as sterols and fatty acids, at                elevated temperatures and pressures are obtained.  An equilibrium flow          apparatus which incorporates a view cell with sapphire windows will be          used to measure liquid-liquid equilibrium compositions and mixture              critical curves.  Preliminary results for the oleic acid-water system           indicate that oleic acid and water are completely miscible at                   approximately 310 Degrees Celsius and 125 bar, and thermal                      decomposition and polymerization reactions at these conditions are              minimal.  The use of water to separate biocompounds or other compounds          of low volatility has not been proposed and no solubility measurements          for such compounds with water at elevated temperatures and pressures            are known.                                                                                                                                                      The recovery of biochemical compounds from naturally occurring oils is          of interest to the health care, biotechnology, and specialty chemical           industries.  The long term purpose of this work is to determine the             feasibility of a high-pressure extraction process which would use               liquid water at elevated temperatures as a solvent for separating               mixtures of biocompounds which naturally occur in resins and oils.  If          successful, this process would 1) suppress the undesirable sterol-acid          reaction which results in product losses, 2) increase the purity of             the existing acid products, and 3) allow one to recover beta-                   sitosterol as a new, high-value product.  A successful process would            result in a significant new supply of biochemical compounds with many           potential uses and would also give the U.S. tall oil industry the               ability to handle a diverse source of trees for their raw materials.",
