 "awd_abstract_narration": "For years archaeologists have focused on agricultural                      origins.  This study goes beyond this endeavor by analyzing the                 effects of intensification, the next stage of development in                    socio-cultural evolution.  The researcher will provide important                new information for understanding the development and                           intensification of prehistoric and historic agricultural systems                in Southeast Asia.                                                                   This study specifically deals with the problem of surplus                  products generated by agricultural intensification and how these                were used by chiefdoms.  The researcher will test economic models               of the use of prestige goods through archaeological data obtained               from excavations in southeastern Negros, Philippines.                                Many chiefdom level societies around the world are currently               experiencing the effects of agricultural intensification.  This                 study will enable us to better understand how economic and social               organizations have been affected by intensification in Southeast                Asia.",
