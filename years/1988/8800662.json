 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will determine the function and neuromuscular                   organization of shoulder muscles in Alligator mississippiensis.                 These data are relevant to 1) the biomechanics of locomotion,                   particularly to speed-correlated changes in limb mechanics, 2) to               functional interpretations of the origin of avian flight, and 3)                an understanding of evolutionary patterns and constraints in                    complex functional systems.  The research will focus first on the               mechanical properties and neuromuscular organization of the                     pectoralis and supracoracoideus muscles using data on                           histochemistry, architecture, innervation pattern and contractile               properties, and second on the neuromuscular activity pattern                    (determined by electromyography) and its relationship to the                    kinematics of the forelimb over a range of locomotor speeds.  The               significance of the expected results is as follows:  1) The                     analysis will, for the first time, provide detailed information                 on muscle function in a generalized reptile over a range of                     speeds.  2) The pectoralis and supracoracoideus muscles are                     homologous to the primary flight muscles of birds.  The results                 of the study, when compared to those already available for avian                muscles, will permit, for the first time, a detailed analysis of                the functional differences associated with the evolution of                     flight.  3) It has been proposed that the neural control                        mechanism for shoulder function during locomotion is relatively                 conservative and constrains or canalizes functional change.                     Testing of this hypotehsis is significantly furthered by the                    results of the proposed study.                                                       Dr. Peterson will co-direct a course in Comparative                        Vertebrate Anatomy, and a graduate (advanced undergraduate)                     seminar on scaling (allometry), or co-teach a graduate (advanced                undergraduate) seminar on the neural control of locomotion.  In                 addition she will counsel and advise students.                                       This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1)                 to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                  engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF                  and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and                     engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists                and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic                    institutions.  By encouraging the participation of women in                     science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future                     scientific vitality.",
