 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to the complexity of the calculations and the lack of                  effective standards, chemical engineers and chemists have been left             behind their mechanical and electronic counterparts in having the               benefits of a computer workstation addressed to their requirements.             A need exists for the means to integrate existing and new                       applications through a common database, to provide an effective user            interface and to generate high resolution graphics for input and                output.  The hardware and techniques to solve these problems for the            chemistry profession exists; it is the purpose of this research to              make use of identified system and manpower resources to investigate,            define and test a system architecture which will satisfy their                  needs.  The innovations offered in this proposal include the                    establishment of an interdisciplinary team of computer science and              chemical engineering experts to study, define, and test a system                architecture considering the special needs of the chemistry                     professional; the incorporation and test of unique applications                 software; the establishment of an effective user interface                      considering the use of \"dynamic icons\"; and determination of means              to integrate existing and new programs compatibly.                                   A preliminary market study and Phase III business plan has                 indicated the commercial viability of the system and the plan meets             the criteria of the Connect Product Development Corporation (CPCD)              from whom follow-on funding will be sought.  SBIR Phase I funding of            this program is user/technology questions on which the system                   architecture depends.  Phase II funding will provide for                        demonstration of the capabilities and benefits of the proposed                  workstation, without which, excessive time and funds would be                   required to convince and gain the necessary widespread support of a             body of users who are preconditioned to expect complexity.",
