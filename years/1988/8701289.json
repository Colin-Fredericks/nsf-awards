 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the major challenges in theoretical research in                     atmospheric chemistry for the remaining years of this century                   relates to the development of accurate and reliable models of the               chemical and physical processes controlling the trace composition               of the atmosphere as well as its temporal and spatial                           variability.  In recognition of this fact, the report from the                  Global Tropospheric Chemistry Panel of the National Academy of                  Sciences and the recently completed UCAR report on Global                       Tropospheric Chemistry:  Plane for the U.S. Research Effort                     identified theoretical studies and modelling as one of five major               research efforts needed to be undertaken in atmospheric                         chemistry.  One of the major objectives highlighted for                         theoretical studies in these reports was the development of a new               class of models that can couple meteorological and chemical                     processes.  To provide a realistic simulation of the transport,                 transformation, and ultimate removal of selected species on a                   global and/or regional scale.                                                        This research project is aimed at the development and                      validation of a chemical transport model capable of simulation                  the transport, transformation, and deposition of combustion                     sulfur from the North American continent.  Time-series                          measurements of radon-222, lead-210, sulfur dioxide and sulfate                 surface concentrations and wet deposition rates will be used to                 guide in the development and validation of parameterizations for                boundary layer transport, wet and dry removal, and the                          homogeneous and heterogeneous oxidation of sulfur dioxide to                    sulfate.  These parameterizations will then be used in the                      Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) general                            circulation/transport model to simulate the export and deposition               climatology of anthropogenic sulfur produced on the North                       American continent.  Of particular interest will be the fate of                 the approximately 75% of the North American sulfur emissions                    which cannot be accounted for in wet deposition over the                        continent.",
