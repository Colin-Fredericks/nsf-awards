 "awd_abstract_narration": "The formation of deep water masses is a significant high latitude               oceanic process that ventilates the deep waters of the global ocean.  It        is a process that is active in the northern marginal seas and in the            Arctic Ocean itself.  This project will investigate the rate of                 ventilation of the Arctic Ocean by constraining a numerical model of its        circulation with observed chemical tracer data.  The tracer data may be         used to calibrate and verify the theoretical description of the                 circulation that is provided by numerical models, and can help to define        specific processes that are related to the maintenance of the vertical          structure of the Arctic Ocean.                                                                                                                                  One major unresolved question is the maintenance of the nutrient maximum        at the halocline level, which has been ascribed to the advection of             Pacific water through the Bering Strait, and to nutrient regeneration on        the Arctic continental shelves.  A second question is the extent to             which Arctic Ocean ventilation is affected by brine formation on the            shelves and its subsequent cascading into deep water at the shelf break.        The particular advantage of chemical tracers in this context is that            tracers provide information and limits on time scales, and so constrain         the results (and increase the level of realism) of models that were             designed to reproduce physical and dynamical processes.",
