 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Simons and his colleagues will, over the course of three                    seasons of field research, collect primate and associated                       vertebrate and plant fossils from sediments of Oligocene age                    located in the Fayum region of Egypt.  The field party members                  will seek, quarry, and sift rocks and sands to find fossils.  The               many kinds of fossil primates occurring in the Fayum include                    species thought to be the oldest known common ancestors of                      monkeys, apes, and humans.  Recovery of postcranial elements,                   skulls, and new kinds of primates during these three seasons                    should significantly advance knowledge of the extent and nature                 of early higher primates.  This research will help solve the                    question of which earlier primate family gave rise to the group                 that includes humans, monkeys, and apes.                                                                                                                        Since the fossil primates come from several quite different                     levels in the Fayum and are only inferentially dated from an                    overlying basalt, more accurate dating by magnetic reversal                     stratigraphy will be attempted.  Because knowledge of the                       environmental context of each of the primate species helps in                   understanding its evolution, geological floral and faunal                       information will be collected at each primate site.                                                                                                             This research is important because it increases our understanding               of both the history and the forces which led to the emergence of                the human lineage.  Dr. Simons and his team have worked in the                  Fayum for many years and in each season have discovered                         significant new fossils.  The Fayum is unique because it is the                 only site in the Old World which contains such fossil remains of                Oligocene age.",
