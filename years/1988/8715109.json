 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a joint workshop, organized by Prof. Ben Chie           Yen of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Prof. Carlo           Cao of the University of Cagliari, Italy, on the science and                    technology of urban storm drainage.  The workshop will focus on the             following topics:  experimental urban basins, rainfall analysis for             urban drainage, infiltration and other losses in the urban                      environment, overland, gutter, and sewer flows, detention storage,              risk considerations in urban drainage, storm water management, storm            water modeling and data as a limiting factor, and water quality.                                                                                                Every year several billions of dollars are spent on storm drainage              facilities in the U.S., Italy and other developed countries, not to             mention the amounts spent for damages due to flooding and                       deterioration of the environment.  Considerable progress has been               made on the technology of urban storm drainage over the past                    twenty-five years by researchers in both the United States and                  Italy.  While research in the U.S. has focused on pollution                     abatement, management, and computer modeling, the Italians have                 emphasized methodologies for the design and rehabilitation of                   drainage facilities.  By bringing together investigators with                   complementary approaches to common problems, this workshop should               help to advance research in this area.",
