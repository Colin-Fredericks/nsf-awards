 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project are: to develop a random-field                   model which can represent both long- and short-correlation                      structures of an image; to investigate robust estimators in the                 long- and short-memroy random-field models; and to develop                      segmentation and restoration algorithms using theoretical models                found in this project.                                                                                                                                          The long-memory model will be generalized by adding the short-                  memory structure of autoregressive moving-average (ARMA)-class                  models.  At least two approaches will be used: the input process                of the long-memory model will be represented by ARMA models; and                the fractional differencing term in the long-memory model will be               modified by a fractionally-differenced autoregressive process.                  Robust M-estimators will be derived for the estimation of                       parameters in generalized  long-memroy models; the objective                    function will be derived by metricaly Winsorizing either a                      likelihood function  or a least-squares criterion.  Issues                      involved with M-estimators, such as scale variance, efficiency at               assumed distribution, asymptotic properties, convergence, etc.,                 will be investigated.  Two-dimensional robust Kalman filters for                image restoration, and maximum-likelihood decision rules for                    segmentation, will be developed.                                                                                                                                The performance of model-based vision algorithms is directly                    related to the modeling power of the algorithm, and will be                     greatly aided by these long- and short-memory models.",
