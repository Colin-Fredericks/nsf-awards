 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physical adsorption refers to the state when molecules are weakly               bound to surfaces (binding energies less then one-tenth of an                   electron volt).  The many phenomena observed in physisorbed films               have attracted the attention of a diverse group of scientists                   because they reveal fundamental behavior of matter in a different               way from bulk systems.  This program presents a multi-facetted                  attack on a set of problems of current interest.  One broad area                of focus is film structure; interesting questions include the                   nature of two dimensional phases (commensurate, incommensurate,                 orientationally ordered) and transitions between such phases, the               growth of films as they become three dimensional and wetting                    transitions.  A closely related problem involves the dynamical                  properties of these films.  Both of these will be addressed by                  thermodynamic and scattering techniques, traditional probes used                in bulk systems.  Another fundamental area of investigation is                  the binding of gas molecules to surfaces; this also is to be                    studied by scattering.  Accompanying these experiments will be                  theoretical studies concerned with the same issues.  Included are               the application of statistical mechanics to describe the                        collective phenomena associated with film ordering.  Computer                   simulation is a particularly powerful tool to explain and predict               these properties, as well as test theoretical hypotheses about                  the force laws.  The systems to be considered include both                      monatomic and polyatomic adsorbate species.  While the popular                  graphite substrate will receive some attention, magnesium oxide                 and other substrates will get somewhat greater emphasis.  The                   \"compound\" system of solid and monolayer film will be studied by                both elastic and inelastic scattering probes.",
