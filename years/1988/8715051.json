 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of this research project is to apply artificial                intelligence (AI) methodology to computer aided design (CAD).  In the           area of computer-aided engineering design, AI techniques hold the               promise of achieving two significant technical goals:  1. The                   production of CAD software which allows semi-skilled non-specialists            to produce good candidate designs so as to dramatically hasten the              dissemination and assimilation of new technology.  2. The possibility           of \"discovery\" by CAD software of new designs and design methods not            conceived by human experts.                                                                                                                                     Over the past decade, the PI and his coworkers have developed two CAD           packages CONSYD and POLYRED presently in use by industry as well as by          universities as teaching tools.  CONSYD allows the experienced user to          interactively build a process model from data, determine the principal          control problems through process simulation, and use a wide variety of          sophisticated design procedures to synthesize several candidate                 designs of control systems which can be evaluated in plant testing.             The current limitation of CONSYD (and other CAD packages for control            system design) is that the design procedures require the user to have           a relatively sophisticated knowledge of the control theory behind each          design method.  Similarly POLYRED can be used to design polymerization          reactors and requires expertise in design, polymerization and reaction          engineering on the part of the user.                                                                                                                            To overcome some of these limitations on the population that can use            these CAD packages, the PI proposes to devise AI strategies which will          allow the average control engineer in industry to use CONSYD and the            typical industrial scientist and engineer involved in polymerization            reactor modelling and design to use POLYRED.                                                                                                                    The first step will be to create an expert system for control system            design which will sit above CONSYD and call the appropriate FORTRAN             programs in the CONSYD and POLYRED packages for detailed technical              calculations.  The second part of the project will involve the study            of \"discovery\" and \"learning\" features which could be added to the AI           design package.  For the control systems design problem there are two           types of \"learning\" which will be studied:  1. The discovery of new,            previously unknown, types of control system designs which may arise             from the application of expert systems with fixed rules.  2. The                formulation of new design rules based on the accumulated experience of          the AI package.  Similar learning features will be incorporated into            the polymerization reactor system.                                                                                                                              The results will not only be new software for these two specific                areas, but will also increase the knowledge base on the use of AI               techniques and expert systems to nontrivial, real problems.",
