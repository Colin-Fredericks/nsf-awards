 "awd_abstract_narration": "A hardware Lisp Accelerator will be designed for solving the                    requirement to do both numeric and symbolic processing in the same              computer system.  The need is particularly acute with real time                 systems, such as expert systems for pilot aiding, where vast amounts of         numeric data must be processed, while multiple expert systems operate           simultaneously in real time.  Coventional numeric computer systems              incur large software overhead while processing Lisp programs, and are           thus very slow by comparison to specialized artifical intelligence (AI)         computers known as Lisp Machines.  Conversely, Lisp Machines are                severely deficient when applied to numeric tasks.  Neither type,                therefore, performs well if required to handle multiple expert systems          in real time.  The research approach is to develop a hardware Lisp              Accelerator - functionally similar to a numeric co-processor in a PC or         an array processor in a scientific computer - able to operate within            the architecture of a conventional numeric computer system.  Multiple           Accelarators as well as host-configurable, special-purpose Accelerators         will be explored.  The conceptual design and necessary licensing are            done.  Phase I will be a detailed analysis and simulation of the                design.  Phase II will result in a working prototype.",
