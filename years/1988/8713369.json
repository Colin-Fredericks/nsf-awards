 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a one-year cooperative research project between         Professor Hirotsugu K. Yasuda, Graduate Center for Materials Research,          University of Missouri-Rolla, and Drs. Horst Ebel, Fethi Olcaytug, and          Maciej Gazicki, Technical University of Vienna, Austria.  The                   collaborating scientists are studying the process of polymerization             which takes place in the plasma region of an electric glow discharge of         polymer-forming gases, a process called plasma polymerization.  A               magnetron glow discharge system is typically used in these studies, and         the scientists want to investigate the influence of the external                magnetic field on the polymerization reaction and the ensuing                   deposition of polymeric product.  The researchers intend to collaborate         in the design and construction of an electromagnetic magnetron                  (electromagnetron) that will permit the magnetic flux in these                  experiments to be modified easily, even during the operation of the             discharge.  Professor Yasuda brings an expertise in polymerization              chemistry and chemical engineering to this study.  His Austrian                 colleagues are experienced in physics, electronics, and electrical              engineering.  The cooperating researchers thus have complementary               strengths, though share an overlapping interest in the effects of               magnetic fields on the formation and behavior of chemical species in            glow discharges.                                                                                                                                                Plasma polymerization has various current and potential industrial              applications, including corrosion-protection coating of metals,                 improved adhesion of paint to metals, electroplating of dielectric              materials, biomedical coatings, and improved adhesion of polymer matrix         to fibers in composite materials.  The development of new                       electromagnetron systems and the acquisition of the basic information           being sought in this project should ultimately enhance industrial               utilization of plasma polymerization technology.",
