 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rhodium and osmium are the only stable elements not yet                         analyzed in seawater.  This is a consequence of their                           predictably very low concentrations (pg/l) and of the diffi-                    culties of analysis.  Their marine chemistries, compared to                     other platinum-group metals in the periodic table may                           remarkably increase our understanding of complexing and redox                   reactions in the oceans.  Until we have a broad understanding                   of their disposition within oxic and anoxic marine sediments                    and marine waters, we cannot pursue this matter.  Dr. Goldberg                  proposes to develop not only analytical techniques for these                    two metals but their analyses in seawaters and semiments                        previously assayed for other platinum group metals and their                    periodic table neighbors.  Analytical methods for both elements                 will utilize graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry.                   Radioactive yield tracers, Rh-102 and Os-185, will be prepared                  from cyclotron bombardments of Ru-102 and Re-185 and will be                    used in all analyses.  These two metals will be analyzed in                     seawaters to depths of 4000m off the coast of California, in                    ferromanganese minerals, pelagic sediments, coastal sediments                   phosphorites and hydrothermal sulfides.  Their redox state                      (and perhaps speciation) in seawaters will be sought from                       their enrichments, or lack thereof, in minerals that form                       under oxidizing and reducing conditions.",
