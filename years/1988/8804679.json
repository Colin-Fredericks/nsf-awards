 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            designed to increase the participation of minorities in research.  The          program provides support to strengthen the research environments and            capabilities of institutions that have substantial minority student             enrollments.  Eligible institutions must also have graduate programs            in science or programs in engineering.  The principal investigator at           California State University - Los Angeles will use RIMI support to              continue research on the intertidal foraging patterns for two-types of          predators, spring lobsters and sea stars, and their impact on                   sedentary prey populations (e.g. M. californianus).  Research studies           will expand our understanding of shore movement of predators, age size          structure, and boundaries of prey zones for high prey productivity and          low prey productivity.                                                                                                                                          This project on prey productivity and predation will strengthen the             research infrastructure of an institution that educates students in             marine science.  The principal investigator is a productive scientist           who is well respected by his peers for his work in this area and he             continues to publish in refereed journals.  This RIMI project will              enhance opportunities for minorities to choose careers in the ocean             sciences.",
