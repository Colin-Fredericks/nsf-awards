The objective of this             program is to provide education through experience in the policy and            processes of the Legislative and Executive Branches of the Federal              Government to a select group of graduate students in marine-related             fields.  The Fellow selected, Mr. Vernon Ross from the University of            Washington, will assist the Division of Ocean Sciences and the                  Directorate for Geosciences in addressing a broad range of ocean science        policy issues.  He will be assigned study projects on these issues and          will work directly with Divisional and Directorate staff in making              presentations on these issues within NSF and with other agencies and in         developing effective means to implement thse policies.  A major goal of         this program is to develop within the academic marine policy community a        better understanding of the role of basic research and of the National          Science Foundation in a broad range of marine policy areas.",
