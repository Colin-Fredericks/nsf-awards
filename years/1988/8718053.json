 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years it has been discovered that most, if not all,                   hormone molecules in the blood of mammals are bound to particular               molecules.  Many of these proteins, called binding proteins, are                highly specific or selective for single hormone or a group of                   related hormones.  Thus, it is becoming clear that these hormone                binding proteins are much more common and widespread than                       imagined.  Apart from carrying their particular proteins for                    particular hormones, it is believed that they serve more                        important functions than transport alone.  We are studying a                    binding protein which is specific for the sex steroid hormones,                 namely sex steroid-binding protein (SBP).  This protein undergoes               large increases in concentration during the reproductively                      important periods of puberty, pregnancy, and reactivation of                    seasonal activity.  The purpose of the proposed study is to                     purify this protein so that it can be labeled and administered to               pubertal animals in order to determine 1) where the protein goes                during this period (e.g., does this protein leave the circulation               and become concentrated in the target tissues of sex steroid                    hormones?) and 2) what role this protein may play in the                        important actions of hormonal steroids during the pubertal                      process.                                                                          //",
