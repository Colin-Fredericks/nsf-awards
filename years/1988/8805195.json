 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research                   Equipment for the Mathematical Sciences program of the Division                 of Mathematical Sciences. It is for the purchase of special                     purpose equipment dedicated to the support of research in the                   mathematical sciences.  In general, this equipment is required by               several research projects, and would be difficult to justify for                one project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation                is coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers,                 and with substantial cost-sharing from the institution submitting               the proposal.  This is an instance of university, industrial, and               government cooperation in the support of basic research in the                  mathematical sciences.                                                               The equipment will be used in the following research                       projects: (1) Linear structural models for random variables; (2)                Generalized gradient algorithms in statistics; (3) Regression                   analysis under model violation; (4) Rates of convergence and                    minimum distance functions; and (5) Cross validation and related                sample reuse methods.",
