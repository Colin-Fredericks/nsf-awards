 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atomization of fluid flow requires that fluid flow breakup quickly and          produce a spray of small droplets.  Present methods produce a random            distribution of droplet sizes.  The objective of this research program          is to theoretically investigate and to determine the feasibility of a           laser actuated atomizer.  The atomizer should be capable of producing           a controllable mean droplet size and a narrow size distribution.                A theoretical study of the behavior of a jet with a high frequency,             periodically applied side, or axisymmetric force will be undertaken.            The results of this study will determine the laser pulse rate,                  radiation pressure and contact area required for atomization of a               given fluid flow.  Water, hydrocarbons (gasoline) and variouis points           will be evaluated.  Study of the laser interactions with fluid jets             would define the wavelength of the laser beam required for proper               energy coupling to the fluid and the means by which to obtain the               proper pulse switching frequency.  The laser actuated atomizer would            be constructed and an experimental analysis of its performance made in          the laboratory.  The droplets formed by the laser actuated atomizer             would be analyzed either by high speed photography or laser                     vizualization.",
