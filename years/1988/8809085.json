 "awd_abstract_narration": "A wide variety of problems in algebraic and geometric                      topology will be investigated by the four faculty investigators                 and one of their advanced graduate students.                                         Professor Milgram plans to work on geometric and algebraic                 problems connected to the relations between Poincare duality                    bordism groups and surgery theory.  He also plans to study the                  geometry of certain classifying spaces related to topological                   bundles and deleted symmetric products.                                              Professor Brumfiel is interested in the relations between                  real algebraic geometry and the Thurston compactification of                    Teichmuller space.  He also wants to extend these techniques to                 the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces.                                               Professor Cohen wants to continue a collaboration with G.                  Carlsson and W. C. Hsiang on the homotopy type of the Waldhausen                algebraic K-theory space.  He also wants to continue his study of               the consequences of his recent reduction of the Novikov                         conjecture to a question about the Waldhausen space for a point.                Finally, he and A. Adem are also working on applying homological                techniques to equivariant homotopy theory.                                           Professor Kerckhoff plans to study the automorphisms of free               groups using some new complexes constructed by Vogtmann and                     Culler.  He also wants to study the geometry of certain 3-                      dimensional manifolds related to closed surfaces.",
