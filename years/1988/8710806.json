 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on the maturational sequence of the B                lymphocytes which express lambda light chain proteins, and the                  mechanism by which the expression of lambda light chain genes is                controlled.  Immunoglobulins secreted from plasma cells contain                 either kappa or lambda light chains, but not both.  That is, in                 these cells productive kappa and lambda genes are mutually                      exclusive.  This phenomenon has been termed kappa/lambda isotypic               exclusion.  At the level of the genes, kappa-producing cells have               rearranged kappa genes, but the lambda genes are in germline                    configuration.  In most lambda-producing cells, however, the                    kappa genes are either nonproductively rearranged or deleted.                   These observations have led to a \"sequential\" model which                       postulates that kappa genes rearrange first and, only if both                   kappa alleles are aberrantly rearranged or deleted, lambda genes                become accessible for rearrangement.  The studies proposed here                 are designed to test an alternative hypothesis, that cells which                express lambda light chains constitute a unique                                 developmental lineage of B lymphocytes.  This lineage is                        characterized by an intermediate cell type that coproduces kappa                and lambda light chains and fails to turn off immunoglobulin gene               rearrangement.  First, fluorescent-labelled antibodies and a                    fluorescence activated cell sorter will be used to determine                    whether B cells which coexpress kappa and lambda are present in                 normal mice and to determine whether the expression of lambda                   positive cells is restricted to any previously defined B                        lymphocyte population.  Second, a rearrangement-dependent drug                  resistance gene, pHRD, will be tested in lambda and kappa                       hybridomas to determine whether the B cells that express lambda                 have an increased ability to rearrange immunoglobulin genes                     compared to B cells that express the kappa light chain.                              The results of this research should provide significant new                information on the mechanisms which control immunoglobulin light                chain gene expression and, more generally, on the mechanism of                  regulation of gene expression.",
