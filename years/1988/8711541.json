 "awd_abstract_narration": "Enrico has compiled a large dictionary of Masset Haida and                 is engaged in elicitation of Skidegate Haida lexical material and               texts from the few aged speakers remaining alive today for the                  purpose of producing a comprehensive Skidegate/Masset/English                   dictionary with an English/Skidegate/Masset index.  Entries will                include syntactic, morphological, and semantic information.                                                                                                          Haida has three dialectal variants; the two northern                       variants, Alaskan and Masset, are much alike and divergent from                 the southern dialect, Skidegate.  Skidegate Haida, though until                 now less well documented, appears to be more conservative, hence                of importance in reconstructing earlier forms of the language and               defining the relationships among the dialects.  Beyond internal                 questions, a better understanding of Haida as a whole is crucial                to the reconstruction of North American linguistic prehistory.                  More data are required for effective comparative study to                       determine whether Haida is truly a language isolate or whether it               is related to other languages in the Alaska/Pacific Northwest                   area.                                                                                                                                                                Enrico knows Haida well and enjoys the confidence of the                   communities where it still survives.",
