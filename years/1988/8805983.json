Central               questions of the research are: 1) Are \"root gaps\" formed at the                 same time as \"canopy gaps\" are formed?; and 2) What processes are               involved in \"root gap\" formation and closure?  A lodgepole pine                 (\u001aPinus\u001a \u001acontorta\u001a) forest in the Medicine Bow Mountains of Wyoming            will serve as the study site.                                                                                                                                   Disturbance patches of various sizes will be created in the                     forest by cutting down and removing aboveground plant parts.  The               activity of fine roots and ectomycorrhiza will be measured using                two different techniques . the screen intercept method and the                  sequential coring method.  Root graphs and mycorrhizal links will               be studied through careful field excavation for the former and                  laboratory dissection of soil cores for the latter.  Finally                    changes in nitrogen mineralization and nitrification in the gaps                will be studied by lysimetry and buried bag incubations.                                                                                                        This research will expand our understanding of the biotic                       responses of forest systems to disturbance.  Research on                        belowground components of forest ecosystems is rare and research                on belowground components of disturbed forests even rarer.  Yet                 we know that this research is needed for the development of                     predictive models that consider the effects of various kinds of                 disturbance on forest ecosystem function, including the forest's                ability to act as a \"filters\" in watersheds that supply drinking                water.                                                                                                                                                          Dr. Knight and his colleagues at the University of Wyoming are                  experts on production and nutrient cycling in the forests of the                Rocky Mountain area.  The institutional support available to them               is very good.",
