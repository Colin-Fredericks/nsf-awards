 "awd_abstract_narration": "Programming highly parallel computers is an extremely complex task              which will necessitate the development of appropriate sets of support           tools, including graphics-oriented programming environments for MIMD,           ensemble machines.  We have already implemented a rudimentary                   environment built as the front end to a multiprocessor simulator.  This         environment will serve as the testbed for our research in two areas:            high-level languages and parallel debugging.  In the area of high-level         languages, we investigate specifications of graph grammar, provide              mapping assistance through graph-grammar based mechanisms, and design           heuristics for aesthetic graph layout and placement.  In the area of            parallel debugging, we would determine which kinds of information is            most useful to debugging of parallel programs.",
