 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry                      Program, involves the development of several new techniques for                 the observation and assignment of rotation vibration                            transitions of polyatomic species in excited vibrational levels                 of the ground electronic state.                                                                                                                                 Pulsed infrared laser excitation is synchronized with the                       measurements taken to record a Fourier transform infrared                       spectrum of the polyatomic species in selected excited                          ro-vibrational states.  There are several advantages to this                    methodology.  It simplifies the observed spectrum, thereby                      facilitating its interpretation.  It is also possible to study                  states that are normally forbidden by one-photon selection                      rules.  In addition it is also possible to study the time                       evolution of the spectrum.  This study will mainly be concerned                 with the simplification of the infrared spectrum.                                                                                                               The research will elucidate the new experimental methodology                    through the study of symmetric top molecules.   The practical                   extent of the spectral simplification will be determined.                       Information on excited vibrational states and harmonic                          vibrational potential constants will be obtained for the                        species studied.  The vibrational energy levels of selected                     prototypical species involved in multiphoton induced chemistry                  will be elucidated.",
