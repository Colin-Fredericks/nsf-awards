 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of earth and rockfill dams, instrumented with strong ground            motion recorders, experienced the Whittier Narrows earthquake of                October 1, 1988.  The closest was the Whittier Narrows Dam, at 4                kilometers distance from the earthquake's epicenter.  The maximum               horizontal acceleration was 0.32g recorded at the crest of the dam,             while the upstream recorder indicated a peak vertical acceleration of           0.46g.  The response of other dams at greater distances was also                obtained.  Few strong motion records are available for such                     structures.                                                                                                                                                     This project addresses the analysis of these records from nine earth            dams in order to understand the behavior of earth dams, and the                 utility of different analytical models for the analysis of dam                  response.  The shaking during the main shock, as well as the after              shocks, triggered all accelerographs on the nine dams, providing the            most extensive array of earthquake response measurements of earth dams          yet obtained in the U.S. and abroad.  It is a cooperative project               between the California Institute of Technology and the University of            Southern California.                                                                                                                                            Three major tasks are being addressed: (1) Data processing, analysis,           and comparison of accelerograms, (2) evaluation of                              internal permanent deformation and cracking in the dams, and (3)                summarizing the observations, results, and conclusions in a                     general recommendation for the strengthening of earth dams for                  earthquake resistance.  The California Institute of Technology is               concentrating on performing centrifuge tests on physical models                 of one or two of these dams, while the University of Southern                   California is concentrating on both simplified and complex                      numerical models of nine dams.  A comparison is being made of the               results of the centrifuge tests, the observed response of the                   dams during the Whittier Narrows earthquakes, and the results of                the computer analysis using the numerical models.",
