 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large vortical structures have been observed to form at the base                of moderate sized fires and to propagate upwards as the fuel and                air are mutually consumed.  This research seeks to understand how               and why these structures form, to quantify their effect on the                  entrainment of air and the burning rate of the fuel, and to                     identify the similarities and differences in the near-field fluid               mechanics among pool fires, strongly buoyant nonreacting jets,                  and natural convection above heated horizontal surfaces.                        Simultaneous measurements are made of the fluctuating                           concentration and velocity at multiple locations inside a                       large, low speed helium jet flowing vertically into air to                      simulate a pool fire.  The fluctuating temperature and velocity                 are measured also above burning alcohol pools up to nearly one                  meter in diameter.  A three-dimensional, transient numerical                    model of the nonreacting system is being developed to interpret                 the experimental results.                                                                                                                                       The results of this research will provide a quantitative basis                  for the prediction of pool fires.  Because it will be based on                  the fundamental interpretation of results from medium-sized                     plumes experiments, such understanding will be applicable also to               fires of larger dimensions, which are of frequent concern to the                community (spills, fuel tanks, etc...).",
