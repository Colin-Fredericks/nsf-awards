 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Bermuda Biological Station will establish a program for                     shipboard technician activities associated with the R/V                         WEATHERBIRD, an 85-foot research vessel that is owned and                       operated by the Station.  A significant portion of the ship's                   operating schedule during 1988 is in support of NSF-sponsored                   research projects.  The Shipboard Technician Program has two                    components: an at-sea component and an ashore component.                                                                                                        The at-sea component consists of instructing scientific                         personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment;                             maintenance, repair, and calibration of scientific                              instrumentation; instruction and supervision of deck                            operations; and providing logistics assistance to on-coming                     and off-going scientific parties.  On shore activities                          include the maintenance, repair, and calibration of shared                      use seagoing equipment and assisting scientific personnel in                    preparing for field work on the vessel.  NSF-sponsored                          shipboard technicians have broad responsibilities for                           providing the coordination and assistance needed for the                        successful completion of research projects at sea.  The level                   of activity and amount of support are closely related to the                    size and capability of the vessel, and its scientific outfit                    and capability.",
