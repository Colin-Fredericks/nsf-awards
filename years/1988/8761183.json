 "awd_abstract_narration": "Miniaturization of electronic components into integrated circuits               (semiconductor devices) has dramatically affected our lives.  No where          is this more apparent than the large dependency American manufacturing          has on semiconductor design and fabrication.  The production of an              integrated circuit requires a four state process: 1) wafer                      fabrication;  2) wafer probe; 3) assembly (packaging); and 4) final             test.  Because of the high capital costs and fairly low variable rate           production costs, manufacturers of semiconductors try to maintain high          utilization of the wafer fabrication equipment   The proposed research          focuses on the task of effectively generating schedules which improve           performance of the production system.  With a small number of                   bottleneck processes dominating the schedule, it is reasonable to               expect that concepts such as aggregation and decomposition can be               applied to reduce the original problem to one which essentially                 involves only the bottleneck processes.  Then, given a solution to the          simpler problem, techniques of disaggregation can be applied to                 \"explode\" the solution into the full schedule.",
