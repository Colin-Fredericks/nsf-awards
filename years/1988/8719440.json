 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to clone, sequence and map transcriptionally                     inducible genes from Arabidopsis thaliana.  These genes will                    be the nitrate reductase gene inducible by nitrate; chitinase                   inducible by ethylene and pathogens, and gibberellic acid                       inducible genes.  The cis acting sites will be mapped by                        deletion analysis, linker scanning and small fragment                           insertion into a test promoter.  In order to facilitate gene                    isolation and mapping a complete physical map will be                           constructed for Arabidopsis.  The Arabidopsis chromosomes                       will be physically separated and isolated using an apparatus                    applying a contour-clamed homogeneous electric field with a                     transverse alternating angle of 120o.  The NotI fragments                       from each chromosome will then be separated and correlated                      with the RFLP genetic map by hybridization with each RFLP                       probe.  Each fragment will also be cloned in a newly                            developed yeast vector.  We will focus attention on the                         cloning of an Arabidopsis centromere.  These will be used in                    the construction of an artificial chromosome shuttle vector                     between yeast and Arabidopsis.                                                                                                                                  Arabidopsis thaliana has great advantages over other plants                     for molecular studies.  The results of this work will greatly                   benefit other investigators using this plant, particularly                      the integration of the RFLP map with NOTI fragments and the                     development of an artificial chromosome shuttle vector                          between yeast and Arabidopsis.",
