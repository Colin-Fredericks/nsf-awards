 "awd_abstract_narration": "The closely related sulfur butterflies, Colias eurytheme and               C. philodice, coexist over much of North America.  Although they                are capable of hybridizing, the females of each species normally                prevent this by evaluating both visual and chemical (i.e.,                      pheromonal) information provided by courting males.  Taylor and                 colleagues now have evidence that the male pheromones within a                  species are quite variable both in quantity and quality and that                unmated females often reject some courting males of their own                   species while accepting others. Preliminary data on C. eurytheme                generally support the hypothesis that an otherwise suitable                     courting male may be rejected or accepted by a female based on                  the qualities or quantities of the chemicals making up its                      pheromone.                                                                           Although a vast amount of work has been done on the                        identification of pheromones of many insect species, relatively                 little is known about the extent or kind of within-species                      pheromone variation, and practically nothing is known about what                causes this variation or its effects on mating behavior.  Colias                eurytheme and C. philodice are exceptionally suited to serve as                 model species for examining the role of within-species variation                in insect pheromones.  The courtship system is well understood                  both behaviorally and genetically, the pheromone components have                been identified, and these species can be mass-reared in the                    laboratory making them susceptible to genetic manipulation and                  behavioral experimentation.  Modern methods of pest-management                  often include the use of the pest-species' pheromone either for                 sampling or for actual attempts at suppression.  The result of                  this study should make clear that pheromone variation can be                    considerable and cannot always be ignored.",
