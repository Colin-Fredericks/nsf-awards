 "awd_abstract_narration": "Charge coupled devices (CCDs) with high sensitivity in the blue and             ultraviolet regions of the electromagnetic spectrum are required for            many investigations in astronomy.  Devices produced with blue                   sensitivity in the past have exhibited problems such as low quantum             efficiency, sensitivity variations, optical distortion and severe               interference fringes.  The research undertaken with this SBIR Phase I           award will use a novel CCD designed to have optimum performance when            treated to obtain high blue sensitivity.  Two different approaches will         be tried to reduce the thickness of the CCD, thereby increasing the             blue response.  Methods of stabilizing the sensitivity of the CCD will          also be investigated.  The goal of this work is to produce a technology         which can be applied to CCDs resulting in high, stable sensitivity              across a wide spectral range from near infrared to soft x-rays.  Such           devices would be of use to astronomy, medical and biological imaging,           and chemical analysis.",
