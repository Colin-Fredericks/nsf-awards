 "awd_abstract_narration": "The United States, by virtually any measure, is the world leader                in biology.  How it achieved this preeminence is a significant                  aspect of Dr. Maienschein's study.  During the period from 1880                 to 1915, work in the life sciences in the United States underwent               a significant maturing process, becoming self-consciously                       modern, productive and explicitly biological as well as uniquely                American in some respects.  Four individuals, Edmund Beecher                    Wilson, Edwin Grant Conklin, Thomas Hunt Morgan, and Ross                       Granville Harrison, played central roles in establishing strong                 and successful research programs which attracted international                  attention and graduate student interest.  Each of the four became               a leader in establishing major biological societies, journals,                  and research funding foundations.  They tried to hire each other                and retained strong ties beginning with their graduate student                  days at Johns Hopkins.  Yet they generated divergent programs in                developmental biology:  Wilson in cytology at Columbia, Conklin                 in experimental evolution in Princeton, Morgan in genetics at                   Columbia, and Harrison in experimental embryology at Yale.  Dr.                 Maienschein is focusing on those four individuals and on their                  changing research programs, thereby also examining the process of               scientific change at this critical time in the rise to                          preeminence of American biology.",
