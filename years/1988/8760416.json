 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I                          project is in the general area of analytical and surface                        chemistry and in the subfield of electrochemistry.  The                         thrust of this experimental activity is the evaluation of                       fluorinated vitreous carbon materials as anodes for the                         electrooxidative preparation of inorganic persulfates.  The                     presently known electrochemical methods for the production                      of these chemicals, which are used as bleaching and                             oxidizing agents and as etching solutions in the                                electronics industry, use platinum anodes which leads to                        high initial capital and operating costs, especially since                      the platinum anodes are partially consumed under the                            extreme conditions necessary for persulfate production.                                                                                                         The alternative anode material that is being evaluated in                       this Phase I activity is specifically fluorinated carbon.                       This substance is a stabilized form of carbon which is                          fluorinated only at the edge sites, grain boundaries,                           dislocations, and other defects, thus rendering this carbon                     resistive to oxidative attack at these sites.  This                             research will investigate the effectiveness of the                              fluorination treatment in increasing anode lifetime and                         lead to the definition of conditions for the successful                         operation of persulfate electrosynthesis cells using these                      improved anodes.",
