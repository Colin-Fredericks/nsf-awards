 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Institute of Physics requests $113,411 over two years for          partial funding for script development and production of a one-hour             television documentary about the decision to build the hydrogen bomb.           The program features the political, moral, and scientific policy debate         of the 1940s and 1950s over whether to build thermonuclear bombs. It is         targeted for national broadcast in 1990, the 40th anniversary of the            decision to build the H-bomb. In addition to PBS broadcast, there are           plans to distribute the film for use in high-school and university              classes.                                                                                                                                                        The project is being carried out by a partnership of noted historians of        science and technology and an award-winning filmmaker, supported by             experienced and prestigious advisors.  It has received start-up funding         from the AIP and several foundations, and has completed some interviews         with participants in the \"debate\".  Historical documents and film               footage recently declassified are now available for inclusion in this           documentary. Because of this availability of additional historical              materials, the advanced age of the principals involved, and the                 anniversary tie-in, the timing of this project is particularly                  appropriate.                                                                                                                                                    The content of this project is compelling: it is of both great                  historical significance and current relevance. The role of scientists as        military, technical, and political advisors to the federal government is        a fundamentally important historical issue that deserves public                 understanding. In addition, it is one of those relatively rare                  conceptually substantial topics that has the potential for gripping             television.  Project cost sharing will exceed $ 335,000.",
