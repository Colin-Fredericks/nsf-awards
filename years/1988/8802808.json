The synthesis of the complex                 molecules that are found in nature requires the development of                  highly sophisticated new synthetic reactions.  The work to be                   done in this research will develop new ways of making                           carbon-carbon bonds which are connected to one another in a                     right- or left-handed sense.  This work could greatly increase                  our ability to make important substances for medicine and                       agriculture.                                                                                                                                                    The principal focus of this research program will continue to                   be the discovery and development of new stereoselective                         reactions.  Among the objectives for continued study will be                    the development of several new families of chiral acylating                     agents, the exploration of new asymmetric acylation and                         carboxylation reactions of chiral enolates, and new aldol                       reaction concepts.  In addition, the development of effective                   chiral sulfinyl transfer reagents will continue, as will the                    deelopment of several new families of chiral bases and                          nucleophiles.  These latter reagents will be employed in                        kinetic resolution reactions.  In particular, it is intended to                 develop a protocol for the \"deracemization\" of racemic                          alpha-amino acids; that is, the kinetic resolution of an amino                  acid derivative under conditions of continous reactant                          racemization.  Also, it is intended to synthesize a series of                   chiral octahedral complexes of Cr(III), Ce(III), Ln(III, Mo(IV)                 and Mo(VI) and explore the utility of these chiral reagents in                  a number of useful reactions.  For example, the Cr(III),                        Ce(III), Ln(III) complexes appear to be attractive for the                      stereoselective delivery of chiral nucleophiles and                             organometals while the Mo(IV) and Mo(VI) complexes are                          anticipated to be useful in asymmetric oxo-transfer reactions.                  Finally, it is intended to complete the synthesis of the                        macrolide erythronolide B and attempt the asymmetric synthesis                  of the immunosuppressive macrolide FK-506.",
