 "awd_abstract_narration": "An innovative new seismic technique, the Spectral Analysis of Surface           Waves (SASW) method, has potential for locating frozen and unfrozen             ground rapidly and accurately through measurement of the seismic wave           velocity profile.  The velocity of seismic waves is much faster in              frozen ground than unfrozen ground.  The SASW method has already been           used to predict the shear wave velocity and thickness profiles for              pavements, liquefaction investigations of soil sites, earth dams,               concrete dams, and fills.  The method is based on elastic wave                  propagation theory and spectral analysis methods for evaluating                 dispersion curves for surface waves.                                                                                                                            One of the most exciting aspects of the method is its capability to             detect low velocity layers underlying higher velocity layers with               measurements made on the ground surface.  This capability of the SASW           method overcomes the traditional limitation on the use of the seismic           refraction method.  Thus, the SASW method shows strong potential for            locating frozen and unfrozen ground layers, even when the ground                surface is frozen and the underlying soils are thawed.  Research will           be performed at two sites in Alaska with varying frozen and unfrozen            ground conditions to develop measurement and analysis techniques for            using the SASW method at Arctic sites.  As the research progresses, the         SASW method's capabilities for detecting other subsurface Arctic                conditions such as frozen roads, massive ice lenses, and lateral                propagation of permafrost will be researched.  The potential benefits           of accurate knowledge of frozen ground conditions to engineers,                 contractors and the public are tremendous for improved performance and          economy of construction and maintenance of roads, buildings, runways,           and pipeline facilities.                                                                                                                                        Research and development of an automated SASW device to locate frozen           ground would be of tremendous benefit to the construction industry in           Arctic regions.",
