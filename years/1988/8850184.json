The students will            engage in scientific research as a means of promoting their interest in         careers in science.  They will be given experience with research                methodology, analytical procedures, and with the ethics of scientific           research.  Using the topic of environmental analysis of ecosystems, and         with assistance from science practitioners and career counselors,               participants will be exposed to the excitement of research and the              career planning process. To insure continuity and the achievement of            project objectives, follow-up sessions are scheduled throughout the             fall of 1988 and the winter and spring of 1989.",
