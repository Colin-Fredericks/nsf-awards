 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is in partial support of a conference on \"influence             diagrams\" - methods for graphical representation of dependence and              independence among random quantities.  Presentations at the                     meeting  (Berkeley, California May 9-11, 1988) cover both                       theoretical approaches and applications issues.  Since the                      speakers and attendees include specialists from the fields of                   artificial intelligence, statistics, operations research, and                   management science, the conference provides a major opportunity                 for cross-disciplinary interaction.                                                  The importance of this work is that automated reasoning                    systems in real world situations must have the means to represent               uncertain knowledge, and must incorporate computationally                       effective procedures for using and refining that knowledge in the               course of inference and adaptation.  The graphical methods                      exemplified by research discussed at this conference are                        an exceptionally promising approach.",
