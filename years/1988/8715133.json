 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a workshop on Italian culture and                       politics from the years 1948-1988. The workshop has been jointly                organized by Prof. Samuel H. Barnes of the University of Michigan               and Prof. Marzio Barbagli and Prof. Gianfranco Pasquino, both of                the University of Bologna, Italy.                                                                                                                               Few countries have changed as dramatically as Italy over the past               forty years.  Migration and economic growth have altered                        demographic patterns and created a vastly changed society.                      Membership in the European Community and increased secularization               and education have brought about important changes too.  This                   workshop will focus on the evaluation of the continuity and                     change in Italian culture over the period, as they have had an                  impact on the political system.  The participants will examine                  the relationship between cultural patterns and the functioning of               the political system.  They will address the question of how                    continuity and change in Italian culture and subcultures relate                 to changes in the political orientations of mass publics and of                 elites and non-elites in politically relevant institutions.                     Numerous national surveys as well as unobtrusive methodologies                  such as content-analysis, interpretation of representative                      documents and proceedings, personal observations, the historical                record itself, and the like will be used in gathering data for                  position papers.                                                                                                                                                The organizers are distinguished scholars who have contributed                  much to the conceptual, theoretical, and methodological                         underpinnings of the proposed workshop.  The workshop has the                   potential to increase our understanding of the relationship                     between broad cultural and more narrow political concerns and to                reassess the way we look at complex political systems and                       processes.",
