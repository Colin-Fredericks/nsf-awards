 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to upgrade the physiology                      laboratories of two courses:  Anatomy and Physiology, and Vertebrate            Physiology.  First, the acquisition of a dual channel recorder                  accessory transducers and preamplifiers for the existing Thornton               physiographs, and the updating of existing physiographs with solid              state electronics are resulting in the introduction of two new labs:  a         Cardiovascular Fitness lab and a Biofeedback lab; the reduction of lab          group size, thus providing students with better opportunity for hands-          on-experience:  and the replacement of demonstration experiments                allowing small groups of students to measure such functions as lung             volume, EEG's, EKG's and volume pulse measurements in four different            laboratories.                                                                                                                                                        Secondly, a TRIAC centrifuge which spins microhematocrits, urine           and blood tubes allows students to determine hematocrit for the first           time and to perform urinalysis procedures in the Kidney Physiology lab.         Thirdly, a T.V. videosystem introduced into eight labs having a                 Histology component is improving teaching and student use of labs               dedicated to the teaching of microstructure.  Lastly, a new still               provides needed distilled water for physiological solutions.                                                                                                         The above developments encourage experimentation, foster                   students' understanding of physiological principles, challenge                  students to think analytically, and encourage technical competence of           women, including large numbers of older minority women who are enrolled         in the college's \"Hill College\" program for disadvantaged students.             The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal sum             obtained from non-Federal sources.",
