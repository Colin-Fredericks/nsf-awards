 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant, funded jointly by the Office of Special Projects in                 Chemistry and the Division of Materials Research provides                       support for the collaborative research of Drs. D'Evelyn and                     Hauge in Chemistry and Dr. Margrave in Materials Research at                    Rice University. The objective of the research is the                           elucidation of the surface mechanisms in diamond growth                         prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) under well-defined                  conditions.  Synthetic processes for the production of diamond                  films is an area of high technological interest.                                                                                                                The work will employ chemically activated precursors, and will                  combine surface science studies of chemisorption and reaction                   with studies of the growth of macroscopic diamond films by low                  pressure CVD.  This work will explore the structure and                         reactivity of adsorbed hydrogen and CH species, the                             relationship between the reaction  conditions and the growth                    rate and quality of diamond films, the importance of nonthermal                 reactions in the growth process, and reactions of dopant                        precursors.  Clean and adsorbate-covered single-crystal diamond                 surfaces will be characterized by low energy electron                           diffraction, Auger spectroscopy, electron energy loss                           spectroscopy and other advanced surface analytical techniques.                  Rate constants for elementary surface reactions will be                         determined.                                                                                                                                                     Diamond films grown by CVD using C-13 labeled precursors on                     diamond substrates will be characterized by Raman spectroscopy,                 reflection electron diffraction, electron microscopy and                        infrared attenuated total reflectance.  The utility of                          laser-desorption mass spectrometry and laser ellipsometry as in                 situ probes of CVD growth will also be explored.",
