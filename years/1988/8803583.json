It is for the                         purchase of special purpose equipment dedicated to the                          support of research in the mathematical sciences.  In                           general, this equipment is required by several research                         projects, and would be difficult to justify for one                             project alone.  Support from the National Science                               Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions                          from manufacturers, and with substantial cost-sharing                           from the institution submitting the proposal.  This is                          an instance of university, industrial, and government                           cooperation in the support of basic research in the                             mathematical sciences.                                                               The equipment in this project will be used by the                          Department of Mathematics at Tulane University in the                           following research projects: Numerical Computation;                             Theoretical Computation; Differential Geometry; and                             Partial Differential Equations.",
