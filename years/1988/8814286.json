 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research to be carried out                by Dr. John Carney, Vanderbilt University, Dr. William Stronge,                 University of Cambridge, and Dr. S. R. Reid University of                       Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST).  The                   proposed research program will involve an experimental and                      analytical investigation of the quasi-static and impact energy                  dissipation characteristics of structural systems containing                    metallic tubes as energy dissipating elements.                                                                                                                  The objectives of the proposed research include four specific                   tasks. In Task 1, the energy dissipation characteristics of                     clusters of unstiffened and stiffened tubular assemblies will be                optimized with respect to their intertubular boundary                           conditions, their radius to wall thickness ratios, and their                    strain-hardening and strain-rate   properties.  The behavior of                 composite (foam filled) metallic tubes under axial and lateral                  loading conditions and large deformations will be investigated                  in Task 2.  Task 3 is concerned  with the generalization of                     one-dimensional shock theory to model the impact response of                    two-dimensional tubular arrays.  Finally, Task 4 will involve                   the development of an expert system which will optimize the                     design of impact attenuation devices employed in highway safety                 operations.                                                                                                                                                     The impact mechanics laboratory at Vanderbilt University, the                   University of Cambridge and UMIST have unique experimental                      facilities, the sharing of which will greatly enhance the                       productivity of the researchers involved.  Results of this joint                project should contribute to basic research efforts in the                      important area of impact mechanics.",
