 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Hamlin is examining the process by which technical                          controversies, especially those controversies between technical                 experts and lay political decision-makers.  How is it that                      technical advice is utilized in the political process,                          particularly in the context of urban public works?  In order to                 understand this broader question, Dr. Hamlin is examining a                     particular case study, that of British municipal engineering at                 the turn of the 20th century.  He will study both the                           professionalization of municipal engineers and the role of                      individual engineers in carrying out the major urban public works               projects that transformed late 19th and early 20th century                      cities.  These projects ranged from water supplies to electricity               generating stations, and included public buildings, street                      improvements, parks and cemeteries, docks and harbors, drainage                 and sewerage systems, and tramways -- i.e. the kinds of projects                which continue to be addressed by municipal engineers and city                  planners today.  Dr. Hamlin will carry out this research at the                 University of Liverpool's Centre for the History of Social                      Policies under the supervision of its director, Prof. E. P.                     Hennock, who will complement Dr. Hamlin's background in the                     history of science and technology with his expertise in the                     legal, financial, and social history of the local governments                   which employed the engineers.",
