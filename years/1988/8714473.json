 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spectroscopic data and reaction kinetics of molecules important in the          plasma and radiation-enhanced chemical processing of microelectronics           materials are investigated in this research program.  Intense light             sources, such as synchrotron radiation, excimer laser, Nd-YAG laser,            dye lasers, and condensed-discharge lamps, will be used to study the            optical characteristics of halogen and metal compounds in detail.               Optical emissions from excited photofragments will be dispersed and             used to identify the emitting species.  The resultant data will be              used to develop new optical techniques to detect chemical species in            etching and deposition reactors.  Laser or VUV induced deposition of            photofragments on surfaces will also be studied.  Experimental                  observations will be compared with a collaborative modeling effort              performed at another university.  Optical emissions from laser                  excitation of molecules adsorbed on surfaces will also be investigated          in this research program.  The emissions will then be used to monitor           molecules in situ on surfaces and applied to the study of chemical              reactions on surfaces.                                                                                                                                          This is a joint research program involving San Diego State University           (SDSU), IBM and University of California, San Diego (UCSD).  Dr. Suto           and Dr. Lee at SDSU are specialists in quantitative spectroscopy and            reaction kinetics.  They have used various light sources to measure             absolute photoexcitation cross sections for many molecules and                  radicals and to observe optical emissions from photoexcitation of               molecules adsorbed on surfaces. Dr. Chuang at IBM, San Jose is a                specialist in the area of laser-induced chemical etching of                     semiconductor materials and photon-surface-molecule interaction                 dynamics.  He will provide guidance for the research project at SDSU            so that the obtained data are useful for the understanding of plasma            and radiation-enhanced processes in chemical processing of                      microelectronics materials.  Dr. Middleman (UCSD) has made several              modeling calculations of transport phenomena occurring in etching and           deposition reactors and is working on a separate but related project.           The expertise of these investigators is unique for successfully                 carrying out the research program.",
