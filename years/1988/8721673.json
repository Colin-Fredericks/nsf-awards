 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several basic unsolved questions concerning the spin glass                      problem, such as the nature of the ordered phase and reentrant                  behavior, will be investigated.  Studies of faster simulation                   algorithms for these problems will be undertaken.  The behavior                 of neural networks for learning and computation will be analyzed                from a statistical mechanics perspective, and algorithms for                    producing better networks will be investigated.  Numerical                      simulations of alternative models of superconductivity will be                  undertaken with the goal of understanding the mechanism                         responsible for the recently discovered high temperature                        superconductors.  Correlation exponents in multifractals will be                used to measure the spectrum of dimensions that characterize such               systems, and questions concerning the amount of information                     contained in the scaling dimensions will be investigated.  The                  statistical properties of systems involving ring polymers will be               analyzed using a new and efficient algorithm for their                          generation.  The dynamics of DNA molecules will be studied in the               context of pulsed field electrophoresis, which is a new                         technique of great importance in bioengineering.  Fundamental                   questions regarding the role of chaos in quantum mechanics that                 have been stimulated by recent experiments on hydrogen atoms in                 strong magnetic fields will be examined.  The quantum mechanics                 of hard spheres, such as a Lorentz gas, will be studied in high                 dimension, to explore the validity of the Gibbs distribution in                 closed quantum systems, and to provide an alternative model of                  energy dissipation involving a finite number of degrees of                      freedom.",
