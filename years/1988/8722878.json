 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds a Phase II research project under the National                Science Foundation's Small Business Initiation Research Program.                In Phase I, Dr. Ebert and his associates examined instrument                    assisted methods which increase the efficiency of recording the                 locations and characteristics of archaeological artifacts and                   features.  This work employed the use of electronic distance                    measurement equipment and portable in-field computers. Associated               software was also refined.  The team concluded that such an                     approach held considerable promise. In Phase II this work will be               continued and in addition be directed toward devising a total                   distributional archaeological system consisting of hardware,                    software and methods for their use in the field and laboratory.                 These methods will facilitate the acccurate, efficient and                      theoretically-supported collection of distributional data and its               management, representation, mapping, analysis and interpretation.               Potentially, it will be widely used by archaeologists in a great                variety of field situations.",
