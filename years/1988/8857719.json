 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research covers a variety of important problems in the field of            biotechnology; however, the major emphasis is focussed on studies of            recombinant bacterial cultures, the elimination of plasmid instability,         and the overproduction of recombinant  products.  Both batch-fed and            continuous cultures are being examined with the ultimate goal of                achieving optimal process control of the systems.                                                                                                               Affinity cell separation techniques will be used to increase the                longevity of recombinant bacterial cultures.  It is hoped that this can         be accomplished by the selective removal of plasmid-free segregants.            Also, technolgy for maximizing hybridoma cell production of monoclonal          antibodies and the use of high-voltage electric pulses for the                  electrofusion of animal cells are being investigated.                                                                                                           The primary thrust of this work is to improve bioreactor performance for        the manufacture of economic bioproducts.  The result that is desired is         that many biologicals that can only be produced in micro quantities             today will be manufactured in kilogram or greater quantities in the near        future.  This achievement would make bioproducts available at affordable        cost and, therefore, contribute to an improved standard of living for           the general populous.",
