 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shear-layer-driven transition in a rectangular cavity serves            as a generic system for unstable shear-driven flow in many                      engineering systems (e.g. openings in the fuselages of aircraft,                expansion joints in pipelines and dead zones between chip                       carriers on printed circuit boards).  Flow visualization and                    pressure measurements have shown that, between the states of                    periodic and fully developed turbulence, at least three different               regimes of time-dependent fluid motion occur.  These weakly                     turbulent regimes and the low, noninteger values of the                         correlation dimension seem to indicate that this open system is a               low-dimensional system that has chaotic behavior.                                       To completely understand the transition process in the                  cavity, the number and types of bifurcations that cause the                     system to evolve from one state to the next must be known.  To                  test the applicability of treating open systems in transition as                low-dimensional dynamical systems, a model of the cavity should                 be developed and tested against the experiments.  While at                      Cornell University, bifurcation theory and dynamical systems                    analysis and modeling will be studied and applied to the shear-                 layer-driven cavity system.  The computing facilities at Cornell                will be used to analyze the large files of data taken at Lehigh                 and to develop the model.                                                               Teaching at Cornell will be done at the undergraduate and               graduate level in two different engineering departments.  Since                 there are very few women in graduate programs in mechanical/                    aerospace engineering and chemical engineering, interaction with                the undergraduate women engineers will be emphasized and the                    opportunities offered to them by attending graduate school will                 be stressed.                                                                            This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1)              to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                  engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF                  and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and                     engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists                and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic                    institutions.  By encouraging the participation of women in                     science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future                     scientific vitality.",
