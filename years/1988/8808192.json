 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a continuation of work performed under NSF                 Grant ATM-8507782, which was an investigation of snow cover                     effects on the atmospheric circulation over synoptic to monthly                 timescales.  The methodology of the earlier project included                    both statistical analyses of synoptic-scale data and model                      experiments with the Community Forecast Model (CFM) of the                      National Center for Atmospheric Research.                                                                                                                            The tasks proposed for the renewal include (1) consolidation               of observational data depicting surface boundary conditions (snow               cover, sea ice, sea surface temperature) into a CFM-compatible                  15-year set of weekly grids for the Northern Hemisphere, thus                   serving initialization as well as verification needs; (2) use of                the surface boundary dataset to extend earlier CFM forecast                     experiments to the multiseason timescale, with particular                       attention given to the magnitude and physical mechanisms of                     Eurasian snow cover effects on the circulation; (3) experiments                 to assess the performance of the recently implemented surface                   hydrology in the NCAR CFM; and (4) and examination of the                       persistence of observed and simulated monthly circulation                       anomalies as functions of the location and other characteristics                of surface boundary anomalies.                                                                                                                                       This research is important because it provides a systematic                approach to learning how snow cover affects weather and climate                 through observations applied to theory and modeling.",
