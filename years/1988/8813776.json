 "awd_abstract_narration": "The performance and efficiency of a chemical reactor with respect               of conversion and selectivity depend on the intrinsic kinetics of               the various chemical reactions, and on physical rate processes                  such as intraphase mass and heat transfer.  The effects of these                chemical and physical rate processes in turn depend upon the                    non-ideal flow behavior of the various phases in the reactor.                   Many gas-liquid reactions of industrial importance are carried                  out in bubble column reactors including chlorination of organic                 compounds, ammination of fatty acids, oxidation of molecular                    pollution abatement.  Such reactors are simple and inexpensive to               operate, do not have any moving parts, and it is easy to vary                   liquid residence time. Bubble columns are difficult to design                   because their complex flow characteristics combined with the                    reaction kinetics result in a system whose behavior can not be                  predicted a priori based on data from another column of, for                    example, different size, flow regime, or gas holdup.                                                                                                            One factor that contributes to this problem is gas phase                        backmixing which results from partial recycling of the gas phase                which is in turn reflected in the residence time distribution of                the gas phase.  In this work the PI will attempt to propose and                 experimentally verify a new correlation to compute gas phase                    backmixing in bubble column reactors.  He plans to use a mass                   spectrometer to measure gas phase dispersion in two separate                    columns of different diameters.  Two reactions will be run in                   each column which represent typical reacting systems carried out                in bubble column:  (1) cobalt-catalyzed oxidation of sodium                     sulfite solutions by air and (2) absorption of CO2 (diluted with                air) in alkaline buffer solution.  The gas dispersion data will                 be utilized to create a comprehensive model incorporating the                   effect of physical properties of the liquid, the diameter of the                column, and the superficial gas and liquid velocities in an                     equation for gas phase mixing in bubble columns.",
