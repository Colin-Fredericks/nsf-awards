 "awd_abstract_narration": "Between 1984 and 1987, Dr. Frison and his colleagues excavated at               the paleoindian Iron Mill site (24CT30) which is located in                     southeastern Montana.  Materials from the site are assigned to                  the Goshen Complex and have been radiocarbon dated to between                   10,760 and 11,360 B.P. (Before Present).  The site is                           particularly important because it provides excellent                            documentation on the little known Goshen culture and because it                 is associated with a dense bed of bison bone.  The abundant and                 varied nature of the faunal and cultural materials will permit                  reconstruction of subsistence strategies, paleoecology, and the                 relationship of the Goshen to other archaeologically defined                    complexes.                                                                                                                                                      Dr. Frison and his colleagues will continue excavation and survey               at the site and will analyze materials collected.  They will                    define the site geology, attempt more refined dating, determine                 the processes which affected the bison bones after they were                    deposited, and collect botanical remains from the soil.  They                   will also perform a limited survey and refine techniques for                    electronic field recording and processing of data.                                                                                                              This research is important because it will shed additional light                on the prehistoric North American past.  While it is known that                 early aboriginal Americans depended heavily on large game, the                  details of this subsistence adaptation are not well understood.                 The Iron Mill site provides relevant data.  On a broader scale                  this research should increase our understanding of adaptation at                simple technological levels.",
