The hybridogenetic strains will be studied for                   evidence of paternally-derived mtDNA indicative of occasional,                  low-level \"paternal leakage\" of mtDNA into zygotes.  Both                       gynogenetic and hybridogenetic Poeciliopsis will be studied in                  terms of mtDNA phylogeny.  By comparing mtDNA variability within                and among the unisexual strains and their sexually-reproducing                  progenitors, the investigators will estimate the ages, clonal                   diversities, and phylogenetic origins of fishes complex.  Results               should help in addressing long-standing concerns about the                      evolutionary longevities of unisexual taxa, and hence about the                 evolutionary consequences of asexual reproduction.",
