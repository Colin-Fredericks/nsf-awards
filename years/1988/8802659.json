These functions, which may be                  thought of as the solutions of a certain very simple system of                  partial differential equations, enjoy remarkable properties that                have made their study fundamental to mathematics and its                        applications for well over a century.  When they are aggregated                 into Banach spaces and Banach algebras of functions, they become                amenable to treatment by abstract, modern methods.                                   More specifically, Professor Gorkin will investigate                       algebras of bounded functions on the disk that contain all the                  bounded analytic functions.  She will also consider Toeplitz                    operators with bounded symbol acting on the Bergman space of the                disc (analytic functions square-integrable with respect to area                 measure), with emphasis on the question of when two such commute.",
