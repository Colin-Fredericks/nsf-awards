 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gregory Galloway will continue his studies of Lorentzian                   geometry. This is an area which overlaps both physics and                       mathematics. The study of events from a relativistic point of                   view leads to different invariants which in turn result in the                  study of different notions of distance, called Lorentzian                       metrics. The geometric phenomena to be studied are related to                   singularities in relativistic space time.                                            Galloway will try to obtain further results building on his                recent progress on the splitting theorem. The physical motivation               for this work is the study of rigidity phenomena in the arena of                singularity theory of general relativity. He will also study                    problems related to the existence of closed geodesics in pseudo-                Riemannian manifolds. These are known to exist in compact                       Riemannian manifolds. Galloway will try to use a dynamic approach               to the case where the metric is indefinite.",
