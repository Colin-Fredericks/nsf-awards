 "awd_abstract_narration": "This model project is designed to encourage women, minorities and the           disabled to enter careers in science and mathematics teaching at the            precollege level. The project will establish a Career Ladder model              which identifies critical high school and college entry points into             secondary school science teaching careers for minorities, women and the         disabled. The model includes recruiting, mentoring, training, and               professional employment for the target population. The first activity           is a high school internship component involving ten hours of                    internship each week for one semester for selected members of the               target groups. The second activity is the College Explainer component           in which, at the New York Hall of Science, local undergraduates from            the target groups are prepared to: orient school groups, offer                  workshops and floor demonstrations to families and school groups,               deliver outreach programs to school and community groups, and represent         the Hall at national conferences and professional meetings. Explainers          work for up to 20 hours a week. Explainers are selected for their               interpersonal skills and ability to understand and communicate science.         The Explainer role will provide opportunities for interaction with              scientists and technologists, politicians, and people of all ages and           walks of life. In the third activity, Explainers, in their junior year          enroll in a formal academic program leading to certification as                 secondary science teachers. The Hall of Science, Queens College, area           school districts, and the New York City Board of Education are                  collaborators in this activity. In the fourth activity students, upon           graduation from the pre-service program, are eligible for secondary             science teaching positions. The personnel division of the New York City         Board of Education and local school districts will ensure employment in         city schools.",
