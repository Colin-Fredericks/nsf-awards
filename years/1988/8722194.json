 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of approximately ten U.S.                 scientists in a workshop with West German colleagues to discuss the             current status and future developments in research on the evolution             of protein structure and function.  This largely bilateral meeting              was co-organized by Professors Hans Neurath of the University of                Washington and Robert Zwilling of the University of Heidelberg.                 Heidelberg has become one of the leading centers of molecular                   biology in the Federal Republic of Germany.  Discussions by an                  outstanding group of U.S. and FRG protein chemists and molecular                biologists will focus on the structure, function and evolution of               specific proteins and protein systems that have been selected due to            their particular biological functions, their unique structures                  and/or their evolutionary interest.  The meeting should lead to a               more active integration of molecular biology, protein chemistry and             the study of protein evolution, and advance efforts to understand               the factors that determine the folding pattern of protein                       structures, the expression of their function and the evolution of               complex protein molecules.                                                                                                                                      Current interest in protein evolution in general, and in phylogeny              and ontogeny in particular, derives from the realization that                   proteins are composed of structural and functional domains which are            the products of gene splicing and shuffling.  While in the past,                analysis of structure/function relationships has been directed                  toward the protein molecule as a whole, this approach has changed               with the realization that all but the smallest protein molecules are            assemblies of substructures or domains which have been recruited in             the course of evolution from seemingly unrelated sources in the gene            pool.  The relation of domains to the organization of the genomic               DNA is one of the most intriguing problems facing the molecular                 biologist interested in protein evolution.  Many of the topics of               the meeting are also relevant to the processes and potential uses of            biotechnology.",
