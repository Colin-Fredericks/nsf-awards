 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of nonaqueous electrochemistry.                   The primary thrust of this experimental activity focuses on the                 electrosynthesis and characterization of transition metal halide                clusters in room temperature haloaluminate melts.  Using                        electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, and electroluminescent                 techniques, Professor Hussey will study the redox and spectral                  properties of bromo- and chloro- complex clusters of rhenium,                   molybdenum, tungsten, niobium, and tantalum in various oxidation                states and he will also explore the range of melt acidities over                which these species are stable.  Such fundamental knowledge of                  the physicochemical behavior of these transition metal cluster                  complexes is essential to an understanding of the structure,                    bonding, and reaction kinetics of these catalytically important                 entities.  These studies leading to this new knowledge have been                enabled in large measure by the advances that this investigator                 has made during the tenure of his previous NSF grant, CHE-                      8412730, in developing sophisticated experimental protocols for                 handling these extremely challenging systems.  The continued                    development of new experimental methods in molten salt chemistry                is an added benefit that is also anticipated from this research.",
