 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent research in the areas of social and health psychology                    has applied Festinger's (1954) theory of social comparison to                   the study of coping processes.  This research has indicated                     that people who are facing psychological or physical problems                   (e.g.,cancer, loss of a loved one) will often compare their                     own situation with that of others who are thought to be worse                   off, a process called downward comparison.  Research by the                     current investigators has indicated that this type of social                    comparison can improve mood states and increase optimism about                  coping abilities.  New studies will examine downward comparison                 as it occurs in two settings.  The researchers will examine                     specific aspects of the downward comparison process, including                  when people choose to engage in it, what types of people are                    chosen as comparison targets, and what effect the process has on                the perspectives of those who engage in it.  Studies will look at               how this type of social comparison affect individual's                          perceptions of deviance, coping abilities and problem severity.                 The effect it has on individual's perceptions of others who share               their problem will also be studied.  Downward comparison as it                  occurs naturally in community support groups for persons with                   medical and psychological problems will be investigated.  This                  study will assess group members' preferences for (downward)                     social comparison targets (e.g., a desire to have in their group                others who are coping better or worse with the same problem), and               relate this preference to changes in optimism and mood and in                   self-perceptions of coping ability.                                                                                                                             The research should provide useful information about the                        process of downward comparison per se, as well as when it ocurs                 naturally and what effects it has on the people who engage in it                and on their perceptions of others like themselves.",
