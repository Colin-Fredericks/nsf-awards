 "awd_abstract_narration": "Artists use static two-dimensional depth cues, such as relative                 size and linear perspective, to represent three-dimensional                     scenes.  Researchers have traditionally considered such cues to                 be important in understanding how humans perceive the world as                  three-dimensional, despite its only projecting a two-dimensional                image onto the back of their eyes.  Recent research has                         downplayed the importance of these traditional static depth cues,               and has emphasized information present in moving displays.  These               motion cues are believed to allow for less ambiguous perceptions                than do static displays.                                                                                                                                        This research will study the interaction between static and                     motion information about depth.  Observers will see a two-                      dimensional display in which two square objects are located on a                road flanked by poles; the objects will begin at different                      distances from the observer and will approach the latter at                     different speeds.  In one condition, observers will predict which               of the objects will first arrive at the \"nearest\" poles, and                    press a corresponding button immediately.  In the second                        condition, observers will press the button precisely at the point               in time that the chosen object reaches the \"nearest\" poles.                                                                                                     In both conditions, response times will be measured for displays                which represent scenes viewed from locations near the ground and                from locations well above the ground, and for displays in which                 there is either a large or small difference between the heights                 of the \"nearest\" and \"farthest\" poles.  The research will test                  the expectation that high viewing locations, and large pole-                    height differences provide a greater impression of depth, and                   will thus result in faster, and more accurate response times.                   The research will attempt to quantify the changes in information                about depth provided by the changes in perspective and relative                 size cues, and compare the relative contribution to response                    times of the two classes of depth cues.                                                                                                                         Research which demonstrates that specific configurations of depth               cues result in enhanced perceptual-motor performance will permit                more effective designs of graphics-driven systems, such as flight               simulators and teleorobots.  Results will also suggest designs of               motor vehicles that will optimize reactions to possible                         collisions, for example by maximizing the driver's eye height.",
