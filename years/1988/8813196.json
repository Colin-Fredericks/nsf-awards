 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this award is to study the effects of intrinsic                  motivation (e.g. goal setting with performance feedback and                     participation) and extrinsic motivation (e.g. bonuses) on performance.          The study involves a longitudinal field experiment.  It will span three         years and will be conducted within a multi-site social services agency.         The study uses a replicated time series design and involves an                  extensive data collection effort of baseline measures postintervention          and follow up data from agency records, questionnaire responses, and            indepth interviews.  The results will have important implications for           management practice affecting the design of performance evaluation and          reward systems as well as for the validation of certain issues in               motivation theory.                                                                                                                                              This is an ambitious field experiment involving a study of central              theoretical issues on the effect of intrinsic and extrinsic motivators          on performance.  It is also of central interest to practitioners                concerned with the design of performance evaluation and reward systems          in organizations.  Specifically, the purposes of the study are to               determine (1) whether an intrinsic motivation system improves the               performance and attitudes of employees; (2) whether the addition of             extrinsic rewards to the intrinsic system results in gains or losses in         performance; and (3) whether these gains or losses are mediated by              adjustments in the intrinsic system.  Most prior work on this issue has         been done in the laboratory or over short time horizons.  In addition           to the validation and extension of theory and the implication for               management practice the research will also contribute to the                    methodology of field experimentation in live organizations which is             still in early stages of formalization.",
