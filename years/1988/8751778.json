 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Institute of Chemical Education (ICE) will offer three                      programs to address national needs and enhance chemistry teaching               of different groups of teachers.  The programs will be held at                  the Lawrence Hall of Science with the cooperation of the                        Department of Chemistry of University of California, Berkeley.                  The three participant groups are (1) 36 underprepared chemistry                 teachers, primarily drawn from the underrepresented population in               California who will be selected for the Fundamentals Program, (2)               20 experienced chemistry teachers selected nationally for the                   Instrumentation Program and (3) 20 highly experienced, award-                   winning chemistry teachers chosen to participate in the                         Laboratory Leadership Program.                                                                                                                                  The Fundamentals Program is designed to update the content                      background and teaching strategies of those needy teachers and                  will offer sequential four-week programs during two summers with                appropriate follow-through activities planned for the intervening               school year. This project design will allow time for teachers to                integrate the body of knowledge and to maintain close contact                   with project staff.                                                                                                                                             The Instrumentation Program is a three-week program that will                   emphasize frontier areas of research in chemistry and the use of                modern instrumentation as research tools.  Participants will                    prepare materials to share with others and will construct some                  simple instrumentation for their own use.                                                                                                                       The Laboratory Leadership Program continues an effort begun                     during the previous summer in which this very select group of                   teachers will identify the factors that influence use of the                    laboratory and develop means of assessing laboratory learning.                                                                                                  Forty percent of the cost of the project is shared by                           participants' school districts, the University and individual                   staff contributions of time.",
