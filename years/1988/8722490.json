 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Michael              N. Kozicki, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering,                  Arizona State University and Professor Alan Owen, University of                 Edinburgh, Scotland.  The goal of the research is to study                      inorganic resist materials for all-vacuum lithography.  Integrated              circuit fabrication is still widely carried out by transporting the             substrates between individual pieces of equipment in a \"cleanroom\"              environment.  Since it is impossible to control fully the                       contaminant content of the air, there is ample opportunity for                  particulates or vapors to impinge on the materials being processed,             thereby altering device characteristics and reducing product yield.             A complete fabrication process carried out under vacuum compatible              conditions would result in a significant reduction in substrate                 contamination.  Many process steps may already be carried out under             vacuum, but lithography, a process which uses organic materials                 with volatile components, is not compatible with this concept.                  This is currently a barrier to the realization of all-vacuum                    processing.                                                                                                                                                     The objective of this program is to investigate the As-S/Ag                     inorganic resist system with a view to applying it to all                       vacuum-processing.  This will be done in conjunction with the                   University of Edinburgh, which has considerable experience with the             As-S chalcogenides and is currently performing research on the                  optimization of the As-S/Ag system for applications in                          microlithography.  The cooperative program will involve fundamental             materials science and physical chemistry research being done at                 Edinburgh, with an investigation of all-vacuum applications and the             development of a full lithographical process being carried out at               Arizona State University.  Results of this research may have a                  significant impact on the development of silicon and compound                   semiconductor device fabrication technology.",
