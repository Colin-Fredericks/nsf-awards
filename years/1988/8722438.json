 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite considerable academic and public policy interest in                the issue of pretrial publicity, currently there is only limited                knowledge of its nature and effects on jury decisionmaking.  Over               recent years a variety of methods have been used to examine media               effects, but, while producing some knowledge, these efforts have                had their weaknesses.  Studies of real jurors and real cases have               typically used post hoc survey methods which cannot fully unravel               the linkages between pretrial publicity and jury decisionmaking.                Simulated jury studies have shown that people can and will form                 impressions of defendants based on pretrial publicity, but these                studies do not demonstrate the impact of any particular sets of                 biases on jury decisionmaking, and, by and large, these efforts                 suffer from problems of external validity.                                           Drs. Penrod and Linz seek to expand our knowledge of the                   influence of pretrial publicity while transcending some of the                  common pitfalls.  Three experiments are planned.  The first                     experiment assesses the impact of pre-trial publicity in four                   actual trials involving varying degrees of publicity.  Using a                  new jury simulation procedure called the \"facsimile method,\"                    videotapes of these ongoing trials will be presented to \"shadow\"                juries selected from community and student populations.  The                    second experiment is a laboratory study that makes use of the                   real trial videotapes but systematically manipulates the pretrial               publicity material that is shown to subjects.  The third study                  also uses the actual trial material but in this instance does so                in order to examine experimentally professional (judge, lawyer)                 and lay evaluations of pretrial publicity.                                           The three experiments combined constitute a most imaginative               package.  By integrating laboratory and field approaches in data                collection and design, the research maximizes both experimental                 control and experimental realism.  From that vantage alone, it                  constitutes an important advance.  In addition, and equally as                  important, the facsimile strategy has the potential of being used               in other domains relating to legal decisionmaking. Therefore,                   this research promises a methodological contribution to the field               above and beyond what it should contribute to our understanding                 of pretrial publicity.",
