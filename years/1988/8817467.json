 "awd_abstract_narration": "Genetic stock centers are indispensible repositories of                    commonly used laboratory organisms.  These centers facilitate                   modern genetic, taxonomic and biotechnological research by                      making available genetically defined strains and species, thus                  providing a standardized set of living laboratory models for use                in both basic and applied research.  In many cases, the stock                   centers also maintain considerable amounts of data about the                    organisms they distribute, including genetic maps, standardized                 allele designations, information on availability of related                     organisms, and comprehensive bibliographies of research                         publications on the organisms.  For example, the most-cited                     biological publication, describing the genetic map of the                       bacterium Escherichi coli, was written by the Director of the E.                coli genetic stock center, Dr. Barbara Bachmann of Yale                         University.                                                                          The growing magnitude and breadth of data maintained at                    stock centers have begun to mandate that computers be used to                   keep track of them.  Consequently, a workshop on the topic                      \"Computerization of Data Bases for Genetic Stock Centers\" will be               held on August 25, 1988, as part of the sixteenth International                 Congress of Genetics.  The main aims of the workshop are to                     discern the databasing needs of stock centers, to provide a forum               for the exchange of information on databases that have already                  been developed at various stock centers, and to facilitate                      ultimate decisions on hardware and design of software for such                  sites.  Participants have been selected based on their                          responsibilities for maintenance and distribution of genetically                characterized stocks of genetically important organisms and for                 their computer science backgrounds.  A summary of the workshop's                findings will be published; it will have great importance for                   stock center managers and will help NSF plan more rationally its                allocation of funds to current and future databasing efforts.",
