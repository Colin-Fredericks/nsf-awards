 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Presidential Young Investigator Award to Professor               Christopher Bretherton of the University of Washington.                         Professor Bretherton's primary research interest is in                          hydrodynamic instability theory as applied to convection and in                 techniques for understanding complex and chaotic geophysical                    fluid systems, particularly those in which dispersive waves play                an important role.  He has conducted research on cumulus clouds                 in the atmosphere using linear models in which clouds are simply                treated as sources of heat as well as nonlinear perturbation                    theory to show how internal gravity waves help organize a field                 of clouds and to determine how the horizontal mean properties of                the convecting layer are modified by the clouds in it.                               In the coming years Professor Bretherton will continue his                 research on several important topics in atmospheric convection.                 One topic is the role of cloud-top entrainment instability in the               maintenance and breakup of marine stratocumulus clouds; this is                 important since marine stratocumulus covers a significant portion               (nearly 25%) of the world's oceans.  A second topic is to                       investigate the horizontally averaged properties of fields of                   deep cumulus clouds and their response to changes in convective                 forcing; this can address basic issues in atmospheric chemistry,                such as how fast chemical constituents from the boundary layer                  become homogenized throughout the troposphere and get into the                  stratosphere.  Professor Bretherton will also examine the                       interplay between gravity waves and convection.",
