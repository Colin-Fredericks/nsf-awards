 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to Dr. Elaine Romanelli under the                   National Science Foundation's Presidential Young Investigator                   Awards program.  The objectives of this program are to provide                  research support to the Nation's most outstanding and promising                 young science and engineering faculty.  The awards are intended                 to improve the capability of U.S. academic institutions to                      respond to the demand for highly qualified science and                          engineering personnel for academic and industrial research                      and teaching.  Dr. Romanelli has already made significant                       research contributions to the field of Organization Theory, and                 has the potential to become a leader in academic research and                   education.                                                                                                                                                      This award will allow the investigator to pursue her research                   interest relating to the origins, processes, and outcomes of                    entrepreneurship in high technology industries.  Much of Dr.                    Romanelli's career research focuses on the organizational                       backgrounds of founders of biotechnology research and product                   development firms.  These studies will illuminate the dynamic                   underpinnings of entrepreneurial processes in industries.                       In particular, better understanding of industry and                             organizational conditions that \"produce\" entrepreneurs will lay                 an important groundwork for analysis of when and why new firms                  are founded, as well as their impact on changes in industry                     competitive structures over time.",
