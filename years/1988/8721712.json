Introduction                                                                      The efficiencies with which atmospheric aerosols are                       removed form the air are not well known, either for wet or dry                  processes.  Much effort has been spent in modeling the                          probabilities that coagulating particles will stick to one                      another, or to nascent cloud droplets or ice crystals, or to                    the earth's diverse surfaces, as functions of particle type and                 size.                                                                                This research has the objective of designing a new tracer                  technology that detects and scales individually tagged                          fluorescent aerosol particles.  It has been demonstrated large                  improvements in detection sensitivity and utility over previous                 techniques using fluorescent tracers, and practical calibration                 for size-scaling by fluorescent amplitudes.                                          A dual-wavelength fluorescent-scattering optical particle                  counter that can be optimized for low count rates, with                         capability for in-flight measurements will be constructed as a                  part of this effort.  Additionally improved techniques for                      dispersing tagged aerosols, to determine the effective ranges                   and times over which these particles can be detected, to                        measure the frequency- and size-spectra of naturally occurring                  fluorescent aerosols, and to measure the differential loss                       rated of hydrophobic and hydrophilic fluorescent aerosols,                     both in laboratory environmental chambers and in ambient clouds                 will be investigated.",
