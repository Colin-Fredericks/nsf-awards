 "awd_abstract_narration": "The beta-tubulin multigene family is regulated during rat brain                 development as manifested by differential expression of at least                three different genes.  Hybridization of 3'-untranslated region                 subclones of different beta-tubulin cDNAs reveals that expression               of two of these cDNAs is neural specific.  RBT.1 is expressed                   abundantly during early postnatal brain development.  RBT.2                     corresponds to a mRNA which is prevalent between 7-15 days                      postnatal.  A ubiquitous beta-tubulin gene is expressed                         throughout development and in all tissues.  Preliminary studies                 in Dr. Berkowitz's laboratory have shown that this multigene                    family is composed of 12-14 unique EcoRI DNA fragments.  Each                   cDNA subclone hybridizes to a subset of sequences within the                    family.  At least one sequence within each subset is DNAase I                   sensitive and is, therefore, tentatively identified as a                        transcriptionally active gene.  Dr. Berkowitz has isolated a                    genomic clone corresponding to RBT.2 .  Nuclease studies in her                 laboratory indicate that this clone represents the                              transcriptionally active RBT.2 rather than its transcriptionally                inert pseudogene.  Dr. Berkowitz now intends to evaluate factors                regulating the expression  of this neural specific RBT.2 gene in                rat cerebellar cortex and proposes the following experiments: the               genomic clone for the pseudogene (and, if necessary, additional                 RBT.2 clones) will be isolated, subcloned, and sequenced.  Using                these subclones, an analysis of potential regulatory mechanisms                 will be performed, including mapping of hypersensitive sites,                   studying nucleosome distribution, and identifying nuclear                       regulatory factors.  Additional studies on RBT.2 transcription                  and in situ hybridization will allow Dr. Berkowitz to identify                  factors involved in modulation of RBT.2 expression during                       postnatal cerebellar development.",
