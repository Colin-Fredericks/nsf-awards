 "awd_abstract_narration": "The introduction of a swath-mapping Sea Beam capability to                      the Research Vessel ATLANTIS II, and tender to the Deep                         Submergence Vehicle ALVIN, has had a profound effect on the                     submersible's scientific operations and productivity.  The                      reason for this improvement is a greatly improved shipboard                     computing capability for navigation and bathymetry, and for                     general data logging, processing and display.  This full                        capability is presently available only during those cruises                     when Sea Beam personnel are on board.  This instrumentation                     project will upgrade the ATLANTIS II's shipboard computing                      capability and will provide software documentation so that it                   may be operated by a member of the ALVIN technical support                      on all research cruises.  Shipboard processors will be                          upgraded for improved maintainability, and common software                      will be developed for precision navigation of the submarine,                    and for data logging, integration, processing and display.                      The new computing system will combine transponder and                           traditional navigation, and data from this system will be                       logged along with individual navigation sources, and                            integrated with scientific data.  All shipboard data,                           including dive, station, submersible and Sea Beam data will                     be integrated in the ALVIN/Sea Beam shipboard computers into                    a common data base for return to shore as well as for                           processing and display at sea.                                                                                                                                  This integrated computer capability will allow scientists                       involved with any operation aboard the ATLANTIS II to work                      with the same computer system containing all cruise data in a                   coordinated and navigated format.",
