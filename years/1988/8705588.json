 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project investigates three fundamental problems important to                machine dynamics and the design of high productivity machines in                material processing and computer industries.  They are: 1)                      Vibration  of Free Center, High Speed Rotating Circular Plates;                 2) Supercritical  Speed Rotating Plates; and 3) Vibration of High               Speed Bands:  Tapes,  Drive Belts, and Saws.                                    The free center plate of Problem 1 is positioned along a splined                drive spindle by fluid bearings acting on the faces of the plate.               It  achieves remarkable control over product dimension and                      dramatically  reduces cutting residual.  The mechanics of the                   machine is not known.  Observed catastrophic instabilities,                     gyroscopic precessions, and  control of the plate position on the               spindle during operation by  driving with the bearings are some                 of the important issues which   are addressed.                                  In Problem 2, the supercritical speed rotating circular plate                   spins  at a higher speed than that expected at instability, i.e.,               the  critical speed.  Designers of disk drives and circular                     sawing  machines currently set the operating speed to                           substantially less than  the critical speed.  The restriction                   limits the potentially enormous  opportunities for increased                    productivity from high speed on both.  The problem must be                      approached with sufficient precision and depth so  that the                     causes of instability are identified, speed windows for  stable                 operation are observed, and possible technological solutions to                 the instability problem are evaluated.                                          The translating bands in Problem 3 cut materials, transport                     people and products, and transmit information.  Operation at high               speeds with high precision requires understanding of the                        mechanics of the system and implementation of vibration control.                A model of the coupled longitudinal and transverse vibration of a               band and wheel system in the absence of dissipation must now be                 extended to include dissipation.  It can be used to predict                     passive and real-time control for vibration.",
