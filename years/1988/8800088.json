 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is remarkably little consensus on the origins of                     continental rhyolites, due in part to the relative scarcity of                  isotopic studies of silicic volcanic systems and to the                         difficulty of detecting upper crustal contamination when wall                   rocks have little isotopic contrast with magmas.  This Nd, Sr,                  and Pb isotopic study of the Long Valley system to be carried out               in the Radiogenic Isotope Geochemistry Laboratory (RIGL) will                   determine how the proportions of mantle, lower crustal, and upper               crustal material change with time during the growth and evolution               of a major crustal magma chamber.  If rhyolitic magmas contain a                significant mantle component, as opposed to being entirely                      recycled older crust, it is important for models of crustal                     growth and evolution.  The second part of the research project                  investigates the utility of argon as a tracer for upper crustal                 contamination, taking advantage of the fact that there is                       generally a large contrast between magma and wall rock in argon                 concentration and composition.  Laser fusion 40Ar-39Ar analyses                 of individual phenocrysts will be used from a suite of volcanic                 samples known to have extraneous argon, which may have been                     incorporated when roof blocks foundered on caldera collapse.                         The interactive component of this proposal has several                     parts:  (1) to introduce her to the department, Dr. Mahood will                 give a general interest talk during the regular lecture series;                 (2) during Spring semester she will participate in Geology 535,                 an interdisciplinary geochemistry seminar; (3) at the beginning                 of Fall semester Dr. Mahood will host a dinner for women graduate               students, following which she will present the results of Zappert               and Stansbury (1985), using it as a starting point for a                        discussion of their graduate school experiences; (4) Fall quarter               she will teach a formal course in physical volcanology for upper                division and graduate students; and (5) during her entire stay at               University of Michigan, she will supervise analyses for one of                  the iotopic systems in the RIGL.                                                     This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1)                 to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                  engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF                  and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and                     engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists                and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic                    institutions.  By encouraging the participation of women in                     science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future                     scientific vitality.",
