 "awd_abstract_narration": "Major interactions between planktonic community structure               and nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems will be researched;                  specifically the sites and rates of nutrient regeneration,                      including comparisons of nitrogen and phosphorus.  Replicated                   pond experiments will be performed in a 2X2 matrix:  fish added                 or not (to obtain different zooplankton assemblages), and ponds                 treated with fertilizer either with a high or low N:P ratio (to                 obtain different phytoplankton assemblages).  Differences in the                mechanisms of nutrient regeneration under these community                       structures will be examined.                                                            Four major hypotheses will be tested.  (1) In plankton                  communities dominated by edible algae and cladoceran grazers,                   nutrient regeneration will occur principally in the water column.               (2) In communities dominated by cyanobacteria, a significantly                  greater fraction of nutrient regeneration will occur in sediments               (if dead cyanobacteria sink), or within the cyanobacterial mat                  (if dead cyanobacteria float).  (3) In communities dominated by                 inedible eucaryotic algae, or in communities having a large                     calanoid copepod component, a significantly greater fraction of                 regeneration will occur in sediments.  Finally, (4) the relative                importance of the \"microbial loop\" to nutrient regenration will                 change as planktonic community structure changes.  Results will                 not only test these ideas on how aquatic communities operate, but               will provide valuable insight which may prove useful in lake                    management.",
