 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator has already demonstrated that a predatory                   fish, the bluegill, can approach and attack an artificial prey                  specimen even when it is not visible.  When the bluegill's                      lateral line sense was chemically blocked it still approached the               \"prey\" but did not attack.  This suggests that the otolith organs               of the inner ear are involved in the animals responses to prey in               the water nearby.                                                                  In this project the phenomenon is being studied in more                      detail.  In one series of experiments the prey is simulated as a                moving sphere and in another the bluegill will simply be exposed                to a series of low frequency vibrations in the water similar to                 those that a prey animal would set up.  The results will clarify                the relation between the lateral line and inner ear sensory                     systems in fish.  This, in turn, bears upon the evolution of                    vertebrate hearing.  It is generally believed that hearing                      evolved as a mechanism of detecting sound waves originating some                distance away; this work may provide evidence that it occurred                  first as a means of detecting nearby vibrations and later adapted               to sound detection.",
