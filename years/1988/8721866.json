 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry provides                     support for the research of Dr. John Garst, University of                       Georgia. The work focuses on organic reactions which occur at                   the interface between a solid reactant and one in the solution                  phase. Many extremely important organic rections take place in                  such a heterogeneous environment and an understanding of the                    various relationships between the phases is an essential                        ingredient in a thorough understanding of many catalytic                        processes.                                                                                                                                                      Studies of interfacial processes cannot use standard kinetic                    methods which were devised for studies of reactions in                          homogeneous solutions.  Concentration inhomogeneities,                          diffusion, adsorption, surface irregularities, and other                        factors complicate the kinetics of interfacial reactions.                       A treatment of the nonlinear diffusion-reaction kinetics of a                   classic interfacial organic reaction, Grignard reagent                          formation from magnesium and an alkyl halide in an ether, will                  be studied.  In this mechanism, radicals formed at the                          liquid-solid interface diffuse into solution. There they                        undergo first- and second-order reactions (e.g., isomeration,                   reaction with solvent, coupling, and disproportionation) in                     competition with their return to the interface where the                        Grignard reagent can form.  This analysis has been tested with                  encouraging success against data from the literature, but                       further testing and development of both the reaction mechanism                  and the methods of kinetic analysis will be carried out. A                      general methodology that will make it possible to apply                         isomerizing radical \"clocks\" quantitatively to appropriate                      interfacial reactions is a possible outcome of this research.                   This work will form the basis for similar studies of many other                 interfacial reactions.",
