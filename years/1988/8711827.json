 "awd_abstract_narration": "The regulation of blood pressure is a complex process, involving                the integrated action of many systems.  The central nervous                     system is a key component of this regulatory process, and one                   site in the brain which has received considerable attention in                  this regard is the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS).  This                      nucleus is the site of termination of the vast majority of                      baroreceptor afferent inputs, and is therefore the first site in                the central nervous system involved in the mediation and                        integration of the baroreceptor reflex.                                                                                                                         Bilateral destruction of the NTS in rats leads rapidly to severe                hypertension, resulting in death within several hours.  The                     hypertension is caused by increased sympathoadrenal activity and                increased release of vasopressin into the circulation.  In                      contrast, it has recently been observed that if rats are                        pretreated to prevent the acute phase of this hypertension, they                survive and chronically maintain a normal resting blood pressure,               although baroreceptor input and integration should be totally                   abolished.                                                                                                                                                      The present proposal is designed to examine the mechanisms by                   which normal resting blood pressure is restored in rats with                    bilateral lesions of the NTS.  The first group of experiments is                designed to verify that baroreceptor reflexes are abolished in                  rats with chronic lesions of the NTS.  Following this,                          experiments will examine whether sympathetic activity and                       vasopressin release are chronically enhanced in rats with NTS                   lesions.  Experiments will then address (a) how sympathetic                     activity and vasopressin release return to normal following NTS                 lesions or (b) how normal blood pressure is restored in the                     presence of chronically enhanced sympathetic outflow and                        vasopressin release.                                                                                                                                            Thus, these studies will examine the ability of the                             cardiovascular system to adapt to disruption of the central                     neural control of blood pressure caused by destruction of the                   NTS.  It is expected that these studies will provide important                  new information on the regulation of blood pressure exerted by                  the brain, and the integration of the many systems normally                     involved in the regulation of blood pressure.",
