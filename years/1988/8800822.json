 "awd_abstract_narration": "The prime objective of the previous Phase I effort was to                       establish whether two new lithium salts, LiN (CF3SO2)2 and                      LiSbF6, in combination with a suitable solvent, could outperform                state of the art electrolytes in Li/Ti S2 non-hermetic full                     cells.  It was determined and demonstrated that LiN(CF3SO2)2 had                the desirable characteristics for use in such lithium systems.                  The Phase II work will be in three areas: (1) utilizing                         established techniques of purification and synthesis to prepare                 LiN (CF3SO2)2 and two other, new organic onion lithium salts, (2)               determination of the reactions of these salts in                                both lithium and solvent at extreme potentials and under full                   cell cycling conditions, and (3) doing full cell cycling studies                in Li/TiS2 test cells cycled at current densities relevant to                   commercial applications.                                                                                                                                        Rechargeable lithium power sources which provide high energy                    densities at high rates have many potential commercial uses as                  power systems in satellites, in portable communications equipment               and for other load-leveling applications.  A key problem in the                 past was the poor cycleability of the lithium electrode. Commonly               used salts are deficient with respect to rechargeables owing                    either to intrinsic instability or lack of proper purification.                 The PI will therefore synthesize, purify and test in a full cell,               three salts that are not commercially available and hopes to                    ultimately commercialize a very safe rechargeable lithium                       battery.",
