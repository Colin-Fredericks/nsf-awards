 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research consists of two topics, both related to the                        development of business cycle models which are formulated from                  micro-economic principles.  The first part develops a class of                  stochastic growth models that combine the most appealing features               of both the representative agent and overlapping generations                    models.  Like the representative approach, the modelling concepts               (consumption, income, etc.) allow an econometrician to directly                 match up theoretical constructs with real world data from                       aggregate time series.  But this model will be much less                        restrictive than the representative agent paradigm.                                                                                                             The second part uses a popular model of periodic phenomena to                   explain business cycles.  The model was first used by Duffing in                his study of a pendulum that is forced by a regular motion and it               has not previously been studied by economists.  Duffing's model,                when applied to business cycles, suggests that seasonal                         fluctuations in tastes or endowments may be the source of                       apparently random fluctuations at business cycle frequencies.                   This model has the advantage of explaining the erratic movement                 in economic time series, rather than assuming it, and unlike                    previous applications of chaotic dynamics to economics, it is not               restricted to systems which change stability as one moves away                  from stationary equilibrium.",
