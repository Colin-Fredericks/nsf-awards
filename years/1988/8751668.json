 "awd_abstract_narration": "Purdue University will provide over a period of two years the                   opportunity for 25 teachers/per year, grades 7-12, to develop a strong          foundation in the atmospheric sciences.  The Atmospheric Science                Education Program will consist of a three-week session during the summer        which will cover eight key atmospheric science topics, basic science of         meteorology, school weather stations, weather analysis, forecasting,            atmospheric moisture, motions, severe weather phenomena and applications        of atmospheric sciences to other disciplines.  Teachers will be assisted        in applying this science content through the development of materials           for use in their classrooms. Equipment will be constructed and provided         for home school use. Field experience will occupy the participants for          one to one and one-half hours each day at the Cherry Lane Field                 Observing Facility.                                                                                                                                             A school outreach program will be conducted during the school year where        project staff will visit classrooms and provide opportunities for               follow-up meetings.  Individualized consultations will be provided to           help teachers adapt the materials and strategies to their own teaching          styles.                                                                                                                                                         Teacher and student interest in the atmospheric sciences will be                heightened by the establishment of a dial-up, computer-based weather            data access and electronic bulletin board system. This will be                  contributed by Purdue University.  Also contributed by the University           will be 8-10 videotapes about the professional activities of atmospheric        scientists and related technological fields.  Both of these vehicles            will enhance the career access information available to students.                                                                                               Cost-sharing by the University and the school districts who are being           asked to support their teacher-participants amounts to 20% of the total         cost of the project.",
