 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new scanning electron microscope will be purchased which will                 include specialized rapid crystallite orientation and particle                  analysis capability needed for on-going research programs in four               major groups at Brigham Young University.  The general                          improvement in resolution over the present facility would also                  serve well many other faculty and graduate students.                                                                                                            The microscope will be equipped with new low-light electron                     backscattering diffraction technology recently developed at                     Bristol University.  This technology permits rapid                              crystallographic orientation of small crystals.  The Materials                  Research Group in the Department of Mechanical Engineering has a                critical need for this capability in order to advance a new                     theory of mesostructure in polycrystalline materials which is                   expected to have numerous applications in predicting the                        properties and optimal processing for metal and ceramic alloys.                 This technology is not presently installed at any other                         laboratory in the United States.                                                                                                                                The microscope will also be equipped with a state-of-the-art                    microchemical analysis system capable of computer controlled                    multiple particle analysis of the chemistry and morphology of                   crystallites and particles.  The present scanning electron                      microscope at BYU is limited to single particle chemical analysis                                                                                               with a resolution of about 2 micrometers.  The proposed system                  offers a four-fold improvement in the resolution of sized and                   composition for multiple particle images. In our current studies                                                                                                of the chemistry and morphology of carbon deposits in catalyst                  pellets and pores (BYU Catalysis Laboratory) the improved                       resolution and multiple-particle statistics are necessary to                    identify the important mechanisms of catalyst deactivation.",
