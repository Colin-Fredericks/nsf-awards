 "awd_abstract_narration": "A crossdisciplinary effort between the PI and John Doyle's group in             electrical engineering has resulted in the development of some                  outstanding control algorithms and real usable software.  Funds                 provided in this grant are to upgrade the PI's computer facilities to           foster further developments in this area by providing him and his               students a SUN microcomputer system including a file server and two             workstations.  The specific projects to benefit from the new equipment                                                                                          will include                                                                                                                                                    a)   Analysis and synthesis of robust multivariable control                          systems for nonlinear closed loop systems often operated at the                 intersection of a set of complex constraints.  Systems                          studied include complex distillation configurations and                         packed bed reactors.                                                                                                                                       b)   On-line optimization via computers with distribute                              processors.  The PI will be able to contribute to the                           development of the \"cosmic cube\" (which involves 64 processors                  connected in the form of a Boolean cube) and is using it to study               the optimal compressor operation of gas transmission pipelines.                                                                                            c)   Development of a user-friendly expert system for robust                         control system design.  The PI and his co-workers have                          already developed some software but it requires expertise on the                part of the user.  Further research will enable   practicing                    engineers to use this software.",
