 "awd_abstract_narration": "The morphology of the mouth parts of cyclopoid and calanoid                     copepods suggests great differences in feeding behavior between                 and among adults of these two orders.  Differences should also                  be expected in their early stages because of basic differences                  in musculature in their respective nauplii, and they begin to                   feed at different stages. However, information as to how                        representatives of both groups obtain their food is limited,                    especially for marine cyclopoids. Feeding rate studies on two                   genera of cyclopoids (Oithonidae and Oncaeidae) emphasize that                  they are omnivorous/carnivorous.  Feeding behavior of nauplii,                  juveniles and adult females of these two genera will be                         determined.  Basic observations will include describing modes                   of particle gathering, capture and ingestion, distances from                    which food particles are perceived and swimming/moving behavior                 between captures.  For comparison purposes, the same                            observations will be made on two species of calanoids                           (Centropages and Temora).  The former creates weak feeding                      currents and is more carnivorous than herbivorous as adults.                    The latter creates stronger feeding currents and is more of a                   herbivore than a carnivore.",
