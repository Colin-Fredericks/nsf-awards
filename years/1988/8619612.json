Spatial coherence of               the vertical component of ground motion across a dense two-dimen-               sional array for as many as 30 shallow earthquakes which produced               approximately 200 high quality observations over a small area of                engineering interest at distance of 50 km or less will be                       studied.  The data consists of digitally recorded vertical                      accelerograms, across the 12-element inner-ing subarray (200m                   radius) of the SMART-1 Array in northeastern Taiwan, plus the                   central station.  The abundant near-source strong ground motion                 data permit major improvements in the attenuation relation and                  the shape of vertical response spectra, both of critical impor-                 tance in engineering design, and their associated uncertainties.                For the projected subarray the uncertainties are only minimally                 affected by site classification.  Dispersion of the ground                      motion parameters in time and frequency domains will be studied                 as a function of source depth, distance, azimuth and magnitude.                 The impact of known subsurface structure and the anelastic                      response of the soil column (for different levels of shaking)                   will be evaluated.  Understanding of the near-source behavior of                vertical acceleration across a dense array outside the western                  U.S. allows independent verification f assumed relationship                     between vertical and horizontal ground motion parameters and                    devise of new site specific attenuation law and response spectra                both of engineering importance in the design.",
