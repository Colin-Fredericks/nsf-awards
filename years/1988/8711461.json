 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds for the development of a dynamic                   cell surface imaging system.  Specifically, the principal                       investigator proposes to capture three-dimensional information                  defining the form of a cell surface in digital form and use it to               compute a perspective view of the cell surface.  The resulting                  images depict surface topology directly, appearing much like                    scanning electron micrographs.  This technique will be extended                 along several dimensions.  Although, currently the time                         resolution of the technique is limited to 0.5 s by the low                      signal-to-noise ratio and fixed scanning rate of conventional                   video cameras, this can be overcome.  The useful depth of                       interference reflection microscopy (IRM) will be increased by at                least ten-fold by computing relationships between monochromatic                 images at different wavelengths.  Methods will also be devised                  for combining IRM with other image formation modalities.                        Computer graphics products will be employed to decrease the                     computing time, costs, and complexity of computer-enhanced IRM.                 The development of such a technique is likely to lead to new                    knowledge concerning cell behavior.//",
