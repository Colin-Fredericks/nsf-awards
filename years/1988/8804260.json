 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much current research is directed toward understanding the                 behavior of trace metals in anoxic aquatic environments.  These                 studies have created a need for accurate data on the stoichiometry              and stability of metal complexes containing reduced sulfur                      ligands. Existing data in many cases are uncertain at the order of              magnitude level.  In other cases, no data whatever are available                (e.g., polysulfide and aliphatic thiol complexes of most                        sulfophile trace metals).  A major question about such data as do               exist concerns whether the complexes are mononuclear  or poly-                  nuclear.  Previous experimentalists have raised this question but               not answered it.  Misinterpretation of polynuclear complexes as                 mononuclear can create immense errors in predictions of chemical                behavior in nature.  A program to make the fundamental measure-                 ments is needed to answer such questions.  Copper and zinc will be              the focus of most of the work, although some studies on Fe will be              undertaken if time permits.  All measurements will be made at                   250C.  These studies will build upon previous work in this                      laboratory.  They will add significant information in deciphering               metal solubility in anoxic environments with applications to                    pollution, waste water treatment and a variety of geochemical                   problems.",
