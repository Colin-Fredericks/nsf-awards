 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will promote computer equity for girls in middle school.           The first phase of the project will develop  training materials that            will enable school district computer coordinators to conduct faculty            workshops on computer equity and to guide the implementation of computer        equity strategies in schools in their districts.  These strategies are          based on the premise that the best way to interest girls in computers is        to introduce them first to elementary applications,such as                      word-processing and computer graphics, and then to lead them to                 higher-level uses.  The training materials will consist of a workshop           Leader's Guide, a two-hour workshop that discusses the causes of the            \"computer gender gap\" and summarizes strategies for closing it, and a           three-hour workshop that examines these strategies in detail and                develops a specific program for the participants' school.                                                                                                       In the second phase of the project, these materials will be pilot-tested        in four school districts in New York State.  A computer coordinator and         an administrator from each district will first attend a two-day training        session that will prepare the computer coordinators to conduct the two          workshops for teachers in their districts.  Each test school will then          develop and implement its own computer equity program.                                                                                                          The project will be evaluated by its impact on girls' interest                  and achievement in mathematics, science, and computer science.                  Data will be collected about voluntary computer use by boys and                 girls and about enrollments in elective courses in mathematics,                 science, and computer science.                                                                                                                                  The Women's Action Alliance and the participating school                        districts are contributing an amount in cost-sharing that is                    equal to 26% of the NSF award.",
