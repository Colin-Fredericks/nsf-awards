 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal has two research goals.  One is to study the              genetic changes that may be important in the formation of species               and the other is to study the factors that may influence the                    membership in communities.  A related group of yeast species                    which live in decaying plant parts will be used in the                          investigation.  Genetic studies of the yeasts will include                      evaluation of chromosome, enzyme and DNA changes, while                         ecological studies will include investigations on host chemicals,               insect relationships and yeast-yeast competitive interactions.                          This research should be important to basic science because              it will help us understand how species are formed and why species               live in specific habitats.  Indirectly, the research will help                  clarify insect-microorganism relationships that might aid in                    controlling pests as well as to help understand how to manage                   plant pathogens.",
