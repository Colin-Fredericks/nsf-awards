 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to improve the undergraduate laboratory          curriculum by incorporating student work utilizing microprocessor-              controlled ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometers.  These are used              primarily in three upper division laboratory courses; Biochemistry              Laboratory and the two-semester Integrated Laboratory.  All                     undergraduates take one or more of these courses, and so receive                training in the theory and practice of this instrumentation.  These new         spectrophotometers introduce important new learning capabilities:               flexibility for conducting new experiments as well as updating present          experiments, the introduction of derivative spectroscopy in qualitative         and quantitative analysis, efficient and rapid data acquisition                 coupled with powerful data processing capability, training in the               practice of computer-interfaced instrumentation for data storage and            retrieval, post acquisition processing and computer remote control, and         the production of graphical results and spectral manipulations such as          least squares fitting, peak integration and spectral subtraction.                                                                                                  A solid set of scientific and pedagogical goals is being pursued in          this project.  Eight specific experiments requiring modern                      spectrometers are being adopted.  While the previous classroom                  curriculum covered the theoretical aspects of modern spectroscopy,              laboratories were burdened by a lack of modern instrumentation.  Since          the department strongly stresses the \"hands-on\" experience required for         careers in modern chemistry, biochemistry and biotechnology, the lack           of proper spectrophotometers was particularly acute.  The courses being         improved serve as an important training ground for employment in high-          technology industries in the Bay Area, as well as for the approximately         30-40% of this department's graduates who matriculate to post-                  baccalaureate studies.                                                                                                                                             The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal sum          obtained from non-Federal sources.",
