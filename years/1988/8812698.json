 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organized collections of thunderstorms, known as mesoscale              convective systems (MCS), are the major source of rainfall and                  severe weather in the Spring and Summer time in the continental                 United States.  A field observational program (Oklahoma.Kansas                  Preliminary Regional Experiment for STORM.Central; STORM stands                 for Stormscale Operational and Research Meteorology) was                        conducted in the Spring of 1985 to study various aspects of MCSs.               The Principal Investigator was one of the planners and                          participants in this investigation.                                                     Previous work by the Principal Investigator has utilized                data from a variety of instruments (e.g. Doppler radar,                         aircraft, ground stroke lightning location devices) to study                    what has been termed the trailing stratiform region of MCSs.                    While most rain produced by MCSs is deposited by convective                     storm cells, the precipitation that falls from the stratiform                   region is almost equally important.  In his previous work the                   Principal Investigator has discovered that most precipitation in                the stratiform region is produced by growth upon small ice                      particles that are advected from the convective region into the                 stratiform cloud.  He found that approximately 20% of the                       rainfall from the stratiform region is due to the original                      particles advected from the convective region and the remaining                 80% from subsequent growth of these particles.  The particles                   produced in the convective region, therefore, act as \"seed\"                     particles; thus, providing a mechanism for condensate generated                 by the mesoscale updraft to be converted efficiently into                       precipitation.                                                                          The Principal Investigator also discovered that positively              charged cloud.to.ground flashes are most concentrated in the                    stratiform region.  He concludes that the positive ground flashes               are due to positive charges carried on small ice particles                      advected from the convective cells.                                                     The Principal Investigator will continue to exploit this                rich data set by expanding the number of analyzed cases.  He                    also will enhance his research by adding a more complex modeling                component to assist in physical interpretation of the structure                 of MCSs.",
