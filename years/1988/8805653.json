 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Boone and colleagues will conduct archaeological fieldwork in               the Lower Alentejo and Serra do Algarve region of Southern                      Portugal.  The project includes mapping and systematic excavation               in a deserted village which dates to the Islamic period and was                 probably abandoned soon after.  Mapping of surface features and                 limited soundings will also be carried out in two additional                    villages.  This preliminary small scale work will provide the                   basis for a larger project.                                                                                                                                     The fundamental question Dr. Boone wishes to address is how rural               communities respond socially and economically to cycles of                      economic and demographic growth and decline associated with                     succeeding regimes of conquest and administration.  In Portugal                 these include the Romans, Visigoths, Muslims and Christians and                 cover the period from approximately 100 to 1500 A.D.  An                        ancillary issue to be addressed is the problem of ethnicity and                 the social organization of medieval populations inhabiting the                  dry, upland areas of the Iberian Peninsula where irrigation was                 impossible.  These populations are known to have been distinct                  from groups in better watered regions.                                                                                                                          This research is important because it will provide insight into                 how relationships develop and are changed over time between                     urban and rural areas.  The conditions which held in medieval                   Portugal still apply today to many areas in the Third World and                 the complex relationships which exist between rural inhabitants                 and the ruling urban elite (who are often culturally distinct)                  complicate regional politics and development efforts.  Thus the                 work may have practical relevance.  Archaeology has a unique                    contribution to make in such studies because it can examine such                relations over long spans of time.",
