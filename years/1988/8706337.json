 "awd_abstract_narration": "Changes of political regime and social structure affect legal                   process and legal ideology.  A scientific question which arises                 is whether as the middle class grows in importance, so too does                 the importance of legal processes increase, thereby serving to                  delimit political power and protect the individual.  Utilizing                  both diachronic and synchronic analysis, Dr. Lev's study                        investigates the legal and legal-ideological response to social                 changes and political conflict in the rich context of data from                 Indonesia, a country of extraordinary social and political                      complexity and one which has experienced rapid economic, social                 and political change since 1945.  In so doing, his work will not                only fill a critical gap in the study of Indonesian law and                     society, but also will add a new and refreshing theoretical                     perspective to the study of legal evolution.                                                                                                                    Specifically, Dr. Lev will bring together data of several types:                archival data;  personal interviews conducted with political,                   legal and other figures over the last two decades or more; press                reports of judicial hearings, legislative debates, and critical                 issues of conflict over legal procedure, institutional                          prerogatives and responsibilities, and the politics of                          institutional control; and statistical data on demographic                      change.  His analyses include a demographic analysis of middle                  class expansion during the last two decades in response to                      economic growth; an analysis of the intense struggle that has                   developed between an essentially patrimonial conception of law                  imbedded in state legal institutions and favored by state                       political leaders, on the one hand, and a still inchoate but                    identifiably liberal conception of law to which private                         entrepreneurs, professionals, and urban intellectuals (including                students) increasingly adhere, on the other; and an analysis of                 the institutional settings and issues in this struggle.  His aim                is to map the political and ideational details of conflict and                  change and explain how, from within, new groups fashion their                   orientation to law and legal institutions.",
