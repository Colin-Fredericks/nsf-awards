Georghiou of the University of                                  California, Riverside, and Dr. Nicole Pasteur and                               colleagues at the Institute of Evolutionary Sciences of                         the University of Montpellier II, France, in the area                           of insecticide effectiveness.  The objective of this                            research is to identify the genes responsible for                               resistance to insecticide in insects, and then to use                           this knowledge to devise specific and practical                                 diagnostic tests for the detection of resistance                                mechanisms in individual insects.  A combination of                             toxicological, genetic, biochemical/physiological, and                          molecular (DNA) methods will be used.  Primary emphasis                         will be on the genetic characterization of the changes                          at the molecular level, which underly various specific                          resistance mechanisms.  Efforts will be made to                                 determine changes in the structure of genes, as well as                         to isolate and purify the proteins that are involved in                         other resistance mechanisms.                                                                                                                                    The French and U.S. investigators have a long history                           of productive collaboration.  Joint development of                              biochemical tests for the detection of resistance                               mechanisms will be carried out on laboratory and field                          colonies of mosquitoes and house flies.  The two                                laboratories have complementary resources in the areas                          of toxicology, physiology, biochemistry, and molecular                          genetics.  This research could have important                                   applications in the fields of insect control and crop                           management.",
