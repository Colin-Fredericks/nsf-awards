Frederking of the University              of California, Los Angeles and Professor Takehiro Ito of Kyushu                 University, Japan.  United States and Japanese participants will                meet at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan August 29 to September              2, 1988.  The seminar will focus on:  (1) recent progress in                    understanding the basic mechanisms of helium heat transfer in                   various fluid domains; (2) various stability concepts proposed for              superconductors and magnets; and (3) research and development needs             in various areas of cooling technology in the light of technical                feasibility, reliability, economics and type of magnet application.                                                                                             Scientists in both the United States and Japan have made                        significant recent advances in the areas of magnet heat transfer                and related magnet stability.  This seminar will provide a timely               interface between these two areas of research as magnet technology              is impacted by the emergence of high transition temperature                     superconductors.",
