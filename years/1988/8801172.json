 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference will be held June 16-18, 1988 at Wesleyan                  University.  Those interested in attending should contact                       Professor R. M. Shortt in the Mathematics Department at that                    University.  The conference is sponsored by Wesleyan University,                The City College, CUNY, the College of Staten Island, the                       National Science Foundation, and the New York Academy of                        Sciences.  Its purpose is to promote the research efforts of                    general topologists, particularly in the New England area, with                 an emphasis on solidifying connections between general topology                 and other areas of mathematics, including theoretical computer                  science.  The invited hour speakers are John Isbell, Daniel                     Mauldin, Jan van Mill, and Arthur Stone.  Some support is                       available for participants, including graduate students.                             Topology is an area of mathematics whose theory is used in                 almost every other branch of mathematics, especially in algebra,                analysis, and geometry.  It is of interest to theoretical                       computer scientists as well.",
