 "awd_abstract_narration": "How the brain codes, stores and retrieves memories is one of the                most important questions in neuroscience today.  The answer lies                in the application of techniques contributed by many disciplines,               from animal behavior to neurochemistry, anatomy and physiology.                 Most learning theorists agree that memory occurs in several                     sequentially-linked \"stages\" or time periods, frequently referred               to as short-, intermediate- and long-term memory.  The importance               of this distinction is that each stage has a relatively discrete                duration, and, as Drs. Rosenzweig and Bennett have reported, each               appears to be influenced primarily by a different neurochemical                 transmitter system.  They are now pursuing a subcellular                        neurochemical analysis of these different memory stages.                                                                                                        These outstanding investigators (Dr. Rosenzweig is a member of                  the National Academy of Sciences) are examining the temporal and                neurochemical bases of single trial taste discrimination in the                 chick.  In this paradigm, young cockerels are presented with a                  bitter tasting bead to peck:  After a single taste they will                    avoid pecking at similar beads.  One of several drugs is then                   administered, each capable of interfering with the normal                       processes of memory.  At different times following different drug               treatment, the chicks will \"forget\" the bitter taste, and will                  again peck at the bead.  Since many of the mechanisms of action                 of these drugs are currently known, these studies will provide                  valuable information regarding which neurotransmitters, and which               subcellular events, influence each stage of memory.                                                                                                             Drs. Rosenzweig and Bennett are now proceeding with an even more                molecular analysis of events leading to memory, examining the                   roles of calcium influx, protein synthesis and phosphorylation,                 and glucose utilization.  Answers to these questions could                      reorient much research on the neuroscience of memory, and will be               relevant to several applied fields such as age-related memory                   deficits, mental retardation, and rehabilitation from brain                     injuries and disease.",
