 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Franklin Institute Science Museum will, over a three year period,           develop a regional Girl Scout leader training programthat provides              science education experiences for Girl Scouts.  The Girl Scout Council          of Greater Philadelphia and the Washington Rock, NJ Council will be             primary partners and the source of volunteer leaders and the target             audience of member girls.  Science Education kits will be developed and         tested for Brownies and Juniors, training materials for staff trainers          and volunteer leaders developed, leaders trained, and several                   post.training support mechanisms developed.  Program materials are              designed for continued use by the Girl Scouts; more than 2,000 leaders          will be trained and 20,000 girls will participate in project activities         during the three year period.                                                                                                                                   This project is directed at the substantial under representation of             women in many science and engineering fields by working with girls in           informal settings to overcome patterns of science and mathematics               avoidance.  Replication and dissemination will be undertaken both within        the Girl Scout Council system and among museums, youth organizations,           and other informal educators.  The proposers are contributing nearly            $250,000 in resources to the project; NSF support will be 55% of the            project total.",
