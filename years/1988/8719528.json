 "awd_abstract_narration": "The petrogenesis of two classes of igneous meteorites,                          shergottites and ureilites, will be studied by making in-situ                   measurements of microdistributions of rare earth and possibly                   other trace elements in various mineral phases.  The                            concentration and spatial distribution of REE will also be                      determined in crystals of olivine, clinopyroxene, and plagioclase               grown from melts doped with concentrations of REE ranging from                  ppm to percent levels.  The objective of this work is to                        determine the concentration limits of Henry's Law behavior and                  the applicability of distribution coefficients measured at high                 concentration levels to the low levels characteristic of natural                samples.  A modified Cameca IMS-3f ion microprobe will be the                   primary experimental tool, complemented at high concentration                   levels by electron probe measurements.                                          The carriers of various isotopic anomalies will be located in                   different acid residue samples from primitive meteorites.  The                  carriers will be identified by a combination of microanalytic                   techniques that include analytical electron microscopy, laser                   Raman, and others.                                                              Work will continue on the improvement of ion probe techniques                   including quantitative ion imaging, improved ion extraction                     optics, and development of a wider base of calibrated mineral                   standards.                                                                      Although the work focuses on meteorites, it is anticipated that                 the results will also have important implications for studies of                terrestrial samples.",
