 "awd_abstract_narration": "The search for unity in the physical sciences goes back at least to             the time of the Scientific Revolution.  A major goal of contemporary            high energy physics is to achieve a grand unification theory of all             forces (GUTS).  In this period, there were three physicists who made            the most significant contributions in this grand quest:  Isaac Newton           who, in the 17th century, unified both terrestrial and celestial                gravity in his law of universal gravitation; James Clerk Maxwell in             the latter part of the 19th century who unified electricity,                    magnetism and light in a single set of electromagnetic laws; and                finally Albert Einstein in the first part of the 20th century who               unified gravity with electricity and magnetism in his General Theory            of Relativity.  Of these three, Maxwell is perhaps the least well               known even though he was the foremost physicist of the 19th century.            His work is important not only for an understanding of the                      development of unification theories in physics but also for                     understanding the methods of theory construction in science.                    Professor Harman's project to publish in three volumes Maxwell's                scientific manuscripts and letters will enormously contribute to the            understanding of the development of Maxwell's ideas.  His work was              seminal in establishing the field concept and the statistical theory            of physical processes, work that is fundamental to modern physics.              Under this grant, Prof. Harman will undertake the research for the              editorial commentary for Volume II of the edition, spanning the years           1862-73.  The manuscript papers of this period are detailed and                 complex, and shed important light on Maxwell's major achievements in            physics, culminating in his seminal work, \"A Treatise on Electricity            and Magnetism.\"  The edition aims at textual accuracy and                       completeness in the reproduction of the letters and papers, and the             textual notes and introduction to the volume will emphasize the                 historical context of the documents as well as providing textual                analysis.  The publication of Maxwell's scientific letters and                  manuscript papers will significantly deepen our understanding of one            of the most important figures in the history of science.",
