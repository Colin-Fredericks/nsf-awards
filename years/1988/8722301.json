 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Hawaii Institute of Geophysics at the University of Hawaii will             acquire several items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed             in a pool of shared use equipment.  This equipment is maintained for            use on or in association with the research vessels the institution              operates.  A substantial part of the ships' operating schedule during           1988 is in support of NSF-sponsored research projects.  The                     instrumentation will also increase the capabilities of the ships and            of the institution to support research and engineering activities.              The instrumentation includes:                                                                                                                                   -A data logging and analysis computer system for increasing multi-               user sea-going computing capabilities,                                         -Rosette plates for upgrading the frame to which water sampling                  bottles are attached and thus increasing flexibility for collecting             discrete seawater samples at specific ocean depths,                            -a transmissometer for measuring light attenuation in the water                  column, from which information may be derived about quantity and                types of suspended particles in the water,                                     -rock thin-section equipment for preparing samples of rocks collected            from the sea floor for petrological investigations, and                        -a flatbed plotter for making bathymetric and other maps of the                  seafloor.                                                                                                                                                      The University of Hawaii is providing considerable cost sharing for             acquiring this equipment.  The instrumentation described above will             increase the capability of the Institution to support NSF-sponsored             research and engineering projects.",
