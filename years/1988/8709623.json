 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seaweeds are an extremely common and widespread assemblage              of algal plants in the central and western tropical Pacific                     Ocean, yet our knowledge of this important marine resource is                   very limited.  Despite their ecological importance, the tropical                seaweeds have been largely ignored in scientific and educational                studies because of difficulties identifying them to the level of                species.  Drs. William Magruder and Isabella Abbott will write                  and illustrate a text for a scholarly book that will provide a                  taxonomic analysis and permit easy identification of the seaweeds               of the Hawaiian Islands.  The text will be written using                        accurate, well-defined terms, and importantly, each of the                      estimated 480 species will be illustrated with half-tone                        photographs or line drawings of an entire plant and its                         distinguishing characteristics.                                                         As the first comprehensive systematic study of the brown,               green, and red seaweeds of a tropical Pacific Ocean Island group,               this work will be an important contribution to scientific                       knowledge and should prove widely useful.  Because systematics                  provides the foundation and framework of almost all biological                  research, the work will be a major step in increasing our                       knowledge of marine algae and should serve to stimulate and                     expedite their use in a variety of ecological and evolutionary                  studies.  Although dealing specifically with the seaweeds of the                Hawaiian Islands, this work will have broader application because               many of the species found in Hawaii are also considered to be                   present in the tens of thousands of other islands in the central                and western tropical Pacific Ocean.",
