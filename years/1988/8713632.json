 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research                                  between Professor Ivan A. Sellin, University of                                 Tennessee, Knoxville, and Professor Sven Huldt of                               the University of Lund, Dr. Anders Barany of the                                Atomfysik Institut in Stockholm, Sweden, and others                             at these institutions.  These physicists will                                   investigate the generation and use of very                                      low-energy ions, including their use in the                                     laboratory simulation of astrophysical phenomena.                               In addition, theoretical investigations will be made                            of the capture of electrons by low-energy ions, and                             of the interaction of such ions with metal surfaces.                            Earlier collaborative work of Dr. Sellin and his                                Swedish colleagues showed how low-energy ions could                             be produced by x-ray impact; these ions are useful                              in the modeling of astrophysical phenomena and can                              also be used in intense ion sources.  This research                             will focus on determining additional properties of                              the low-energy ions formed by x-ray impact; on                                  developing additional methods of producing such                                 ions; and on developing experimental techniques for                             their use.                                                                                                                                                      The U.S. and Swedish collaborators share common                                 elements of apparatus and techniques in this field,                             and one of the Swedish physicists is the developer                              of the time-of-flight analyzer used to explore                                  production rates and temperatures of the low-energy                             ions produced by x-rays.  The Swedish investigators                             will benefit from the use of x-ray sources                                      unavailable in their country, and the U.S.                                      investigators will benefit from Swedish expertise in                            instrumentation.  Results of this work may have                                 important long-range benefits by enabling us to                                 increase  our understanding of astrophysical                                    phenomena through laboratory experiments, and also                              by facilitating the production of ion beams suitable                            for microfabrication and other experimental                                     purposes.",
