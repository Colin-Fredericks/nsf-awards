 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transcription termination protein rho of E. coli acts to                        release newly synthesized RNA from the DNA template and from                    paused RNA polymerase.  Rho is an ATPase which is active only                   when RNA is bound, and rho must hydrolyze ATP to achieve                        transcript release.  The mechanism of RNA-dependent nucleotide                  hydrolysis and the role of such hydrolysis in transcript                        release are not known.  The goal of the present research is to                  understand both chemical and kinetic features of ATP binding,                   RNA binding, and ATP hydrolysis by rho and to apply this                        knowledge toward an understanding of the molecular mechanism of                 transcript release.                                                                                                                                             The proposed experiments are concerned with (1) the                             stoichiometry, rates, and order of events on the enzyme: how                    many molecules of ligand bind, how fast, and in what order;                     (2) the overall reaction stoichiometry: how many molecules of                   ATP are hydrolyzed per RNA chain released; and (3) the                          molecular details of interactions between the enzyme and its                    substrates: what are the interactions by which the substrates                   bind, and what amino acid residues are important in catalysis?                  These experiments test specific models of rho action, which                     will either be supported or discarded based on the results.                     Aspects of this work will contribute to the understanding of                    other proteins that bind ATP or RNA and to the more general                     problem of biological energy transduction.                                                                                                                      This investigator is studying the process by which proteins are                 synthesized by the process of translation from messenger RNA.                   The last step in this process is the so-called termination step                 in which the completed protein chain is released from the RNA.                  This is a step which requires energy in the form of ATP.  Dr.                   Stitt wishes to elucidate the mechanism by  which this complex                  reaction takes place.",
