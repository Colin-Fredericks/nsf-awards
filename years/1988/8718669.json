 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will include a series of experiments                              investigating the properties of the human perceptual and                        cognitive systems involved in detecting and recognizing the                     emotions on the face of another human being.  The researchers                   will test the hypothesis that an angry face can be found very                   easily even when it is \"hidden\" in a large crowd of nonangry                    faces.  The researchers intend to show that threatening faces                   draw attention, that angry faces \"pop out\" of a crowd.  In a                    second experiment, the researchers will explore the way in which                memory for faces influences attention to faces.  Extending the                  idea that the systems controlling the type of faces which will                  attract attention are governed by a principle of threat                         detection, the investigators will attempt to show that attention                is drawn to a stranger's face even when it is hidden in a crowd                 of familiar faces, that a stranger in a crowd of friends is more                likely to be noticed than a friend in a crowd of strangers.  A                  third experiment will be conducted to discover which of two                     changes is more likely to be attention grabbing: a friendly face                that becomes hostile or a hostile face that becomes friendly.                   All of the research is designed to explore the way in which                     facesare remembered and how attention comes to be drawn to some                 faces but not others.  The experiments use what can be called a                 \"face-in-the-crowd\" method.  A person is shown a crowd of faces                 in which there is one discrepant face--say an angry face in a                   crowd of happy faces or a stranger's face in a crowd of friends.                The researchers will (a) track eye movements to discover which                  face draws attention, and (b) measure how long it takes to find                 the discrepant fact.  These studies test the general hypothesis                 that threatening faces attract attention when they are seen and                 are better remembered later.                                                                                                                                    The Principal Investigators have produced interesting research                  in the past.  They are well-trained in the psychophysiological                  techniques to be used in the current research.",
