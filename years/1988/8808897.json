 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this research are to evaluate and directly compare            the intrinsic, non-diffusion limited kinetics of enzymatic catalysis            in organic media to mechanistically identical reactions in aqueous              solutions.  This study should extend the practical utilization of               enzymes as effective catalysts in organic media by elucidating the              variables which control enzymatic activity in novel environments.               This should eliminate the continued dependence of enzymatic catalysis           in organic media to phenomenological investigations and enable                  quantitative evaluations of enzymatic activity to be performed.  In             particular, horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of p-anisidine           will be used as a model reaction to quantitatively evaluate the effect          of organic solvents on enzymic catalytic efficiency.  Diffusional               limitations will be eliminated by immobilization of the enzyme to               solid supports and by vigorous agitation in a monophasic organic                solvent.                                                                                                                                                        Horseradish peroxidase - catalyzed polymerization of phenols in                 organic media may represent a viable alternative to conventional                phenol-formaldehyde resins.  The enzymatic approach offers the                  attractive alternatives of high reaction selectivity and the absence            of formaldehyde.  In the long term, peroxidase-produced phenolic                polymers may find use both as general movolak or resole                         resins and for more specific uses such as supports for                          chromatography, molecular weight standards, semiconductor                       plastics, polymeric dyes, and developer resins.",
