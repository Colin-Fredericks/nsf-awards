 "awd_abstract_narration": "Streptomyces scabies, a gram positive soil bacterium, is                        the causative organism for scab disease on a variety of                         underground vegetables.  The pathogen produces an extracellular                 esterase which may be involved in the breakdown of suberin, a                   waxy polyester compound that covers the surface of the tuber                    and thus protect the plant against moisture and possibly                        pathogen invasion.  This esterase has been purified and                         characterized.  Its production is induced by zinc which was                     found to be a component of suberin.  The goal of the research                   is to elucidate the mechanism by which zinc effects this                        induction.  The esterase gene will be cloned and its sequence                   determined.  Transcription of the gene, the stability and                       translation of the esterase mRNA, and processing/secretion of                   the esterase will be tested for zinc dependence.  Secretion of                  this esterase by the pathogen will also be studied.                                                                                                             This research will provide important basic information of                       the mechanisms of gene expression and protein secretion in                      Streptomyces scabies, an agriculturally important pathogen.                     The results will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of                 gene regulation and the molecular biology of host-pathogen                      interactions.  They may also be applied to the protection of                    economic crops against infection by pathogenic organisms.",
