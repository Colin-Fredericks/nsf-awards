Richmond, PI.                                                                           The nature and extent of genetic variation in natural                   populations and its adaptive significance are central questions                 in population genetics.  The use of recombinant DNA technologies                allows population geneticists to specify precisely the amount and               kind of variation which are found in natural populations at                     specific gene loci.  Genetic variation in DNA sequences coding                  for the structure and regulation of the esterase-6 gene in fruit                flies (Drosophila) will be assessed by determining the sequence                 of esterase-6 genes which specify different forms of the esterase               6 protein.  This information will allow a test of predictions                   about the genetic structure of natural populations and the                      significance of genetic variation in the structure of enzymes.                          The esterase-6 gene specifies the structure of an enzyme                which is involved in regulating the reproductive behavior of                    female fruit flies and may also be involved in the mechanisms by                which fruit flies and other insects develop resistance to some                  classes of insecticides.  Information about the structure of this               enzyme may contribute to our understanding of the basic                         reproductive processes of insects and may eventually allow the                  design of insecticidal agents which are specifically targeted and               less likely to be thwarted by the development of resistant                      strains of insects.",
