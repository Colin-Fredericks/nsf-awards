The contractor will generate                 detailed statistical tables displaying survey results and provide               technical support as needed.                                                         As part of its requirement under the National                              Science Foundation Act, as amended, to provide a central                        clearinghouse for the collection, interpretation, and analysis of               data on the current and projected availability of scientific and                technical resources and personnel in the United States, NSF                     collects and disseminates statistical data on detailed                          characteristics of graduate science and engineering enrollment                  in academic institutions.  Data derived from this survey series                 are used by internal NSF management and the National Science                    Board, as well as by analysts at the Federal, State, and                        institutional levels to predict changes in the supply of                        scientists and engineers and, in combination with demand                        projections based on other sources, to generate early warning of                possible imbalances of supply and demand.",
