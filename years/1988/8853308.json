 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to upgrade the biological and                  technical training of women undergraduates through the improvement of           their light-microscopy laboratory curricula.  A major thrust of the             project is to enable students to view living organisms and tissues, and         to learn modern techniques for the examination and evaluation of living         cells, cell processes and structures.                                                                                                                                The addition of phase, polarized and fluorescence capabilities,            and of stereo and invited microscopes, increases the level of                   instructional sophistication and significantly upgrades the technical           proficiency of emerging students.  The new microscopes upgrade the              entire departmental curriculum, greatly expanding the range of                  laboratory experiments available in each laboratory offering, and               broadening independent student research program, thus making the women          scientists emerging from this department more competitive in today's            competition for graduate school admission and for places in the                 scientific/technological labor market.                                                                                                                               The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
