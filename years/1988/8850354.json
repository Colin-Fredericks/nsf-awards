To accomplish its program RFB has entered into a partnership with the           American Association for the Advancement of Science for the purpose of          finding scientists who will record these books as volunteers in our 29          studios across the country.  RFB will also establish a new studio to            specialize in recording these books.  And it has selected several of its        established studios to put more emphasis in recording such books.  The          staff of RFB studios will be increased and trained to handle the                additional work involved.",
