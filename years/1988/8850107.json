This               project targets 8th, 9th, and 10th grade students from a 7 county area          surrounding Wright State University.  Students interest in science              careers will be developed through an intensive 3-week summer institute,         followed by 9 months of academic year continuation activities.  The             workshop will place students in an experimental research environment,           using archaeology as an entry mode for rich interdisciplinary learning.                                                                                                                                                                         Students will have a hands-on experience in the process of scientific           inquiry through participation in a simulated archaeological dig and             through observation of, and interaction with, practicing local                  archaeologists and paleontologists currently conducting a dip.  Topics          in related sciences will be introduced as a natural outflow from                concepts and phenomena encountered by the students during their                 research (e.g., earth science and chemistry applications in the                 archaeological field).  Career information will be integrated with              content knowledge throughout the curriculum.  Multimodal                        teaching/learning activities and strategies will be used, with most             classroom activities being structured as small group cooperative                projects.",
