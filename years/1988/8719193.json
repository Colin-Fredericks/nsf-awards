 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports the travel of four senior U.S.              scientists in a workshop and symposium on aspects of many-body effects          in molecules and extending systems, to be held in Calcutta, India,              February 10, 1988.  The number of scientists who specialize in                  many-body theory are few, and they are dependent on Conferences,                workshops and symposia to communicate with each other.  This meeting is         the first in India where some of the best theoretical work in these             fields is currently being done. Topics to be covered will include               molecular electronic structure, formal aspects of many-body theory,             many-body approach to extended systems and to electro-kinetic                   phenomena.                                                                      Scope:  The meeting is hosted by the Indian Association for the                 cultivation of Science, and will include scientists from Japan and from         Europe in addition to the U.S. and from India and could lead to future          scientific collaboration in this important field which has applications         in chemistry, molecular physics, solid-state and nuclear physics.",
