 "awd_abstract_narration": "Serotonin plays an important role in neurodevelopment by causing                changes in forebrain naturation, neurite outgrowth, expression of               postsynaptic receptors, and on the apprearance of inhibitory                    behaviors.  This research will focus on the proposition that a                  component of the action of 5-HT on serotonergic neurons                         (autoregulation) may be its intracellular metabolism by monoamine               oxidase (MAO).  The hypothesis is based on the fact that                        metabolism of 5-HT by MAO generates H202, which is highly toxic                 to neurons because it can form hydroxy-free radicals.  The enzyme               MAO exists in two forms, A and B.  MAO-A has a higher affinity                  for 5-HT than MAO-B, but this latter form is localized to                       serotonergic neurons and astrocytes.                                                                                                                            Preliminary studies indicate that inhibition of MAO-B is                        effective in augmenting fetal 5-HT development.  The studies are                clinically relevant because of the widespread use of monoamine                  oxidase inhibitors in depressed patients.  They may also help                   understand age-related degenerative processes underlying dementia               since MAO-B is increased during aging while serotonergic neurons,               important in learning and memory, are reduced.",
