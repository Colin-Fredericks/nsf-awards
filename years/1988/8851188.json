 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to provide undergraduates new                   experiences in applying state-of-the-art, computer-interfaced                   instruments to the study of whole organisms.  It permits them to                implement mebabolic studies at several levels in the Biology                    curriculum through the acquisition and utilization of two Ametek S-             3A/II oxygen analyzers, the upgrade of the Li-Cor CO2 analyzer to the           standard of Li-Cor 6250, and acquisition of appropriate computer and            interfacing equipment.                                                                                                                                               The Ametek oxygen analyzers are being applied to laboratory                exercises on metabolism in freshman Biology and in three upper                  division courses.  Several of these laboratory exercises examine                temperature effects on biological processes.  Both instruments and the          computer-interfacing capabilities also enrich independent study and             research participation programs which are viewed as essential for a             strong department.  The project is significant because it enhances              quantitative and experimental experiences at the organismic level in            this department, at a time when improvements recently have been made in         instrumentation and methodology for ecological studies and for cellular         and biotechnological studies.  Students at several levels of                    educational development now have access to quality systems for studies          of organismic gas exchange in highly experimental settings in which             instruments are computer controlled and data are reduced and analyzed           on-line.                                                                                                                                                             The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
