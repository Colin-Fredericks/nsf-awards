The                 workshop will be held immediately prior to the Annual Meeting of                the Institute of Mathematical Statistics and its Special                        Symposium on Probability and its Applications.  Each workshop                   participant will give a brief introduction to her area of                       research interest and describe her reseach environment.                              The opportunity to meet and interact with each other as well               as with a few established women researchers will be invaluable as               the participants learn to promote their own research and to                     decrease their professional isolation.",
