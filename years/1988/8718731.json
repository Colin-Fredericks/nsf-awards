 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Lomax proposes a feasibility study of a simple but                      powerful approach to isolating the indole-3-acetic acid uptake                  symport.  This involves photoaffinity labeling of the protein in                purified plant plasma membranes with a tritiated azido-IAA                      analog, 3H-5N3IAA.  The azido auxin after exposure to UV light in               the presence of plasma vesicles will provide a covalent label                   which will allow identification of the protein during subsequent                solubilization and purification by HPLC and SDS-PAGE.  The pilot                studies will establish: 1. the optimal conditions for the binding               of 3H-5N3IAA to phase-purified plasma membrane vesicles, 2. the                 affinity of 3H-5N3IAA for the uptake carrier, 3. the ability of                 covalent binding of the azido auxin to block IAA transport by the               uptake symport, and 4. the specificity of the azido IAA for the                 carrier in the presence of excess IAA, other auxin analogs, and                 auxin transport inhibitors. Taken together, the results of these                studies should indicate if only the uptake symport or also other                IAA-binding proteins (such as the efflux carrier) are labeled and               whether or not the photoaffinity method will be appropriate for                 isolation of the auxin uptake carrier.                                          %%%                                                                                 Very little is known about the mechanisms of action of plant                hormones.  The hormone auxin is essential to the control of plant               development.  This hormone is transported into the plant cells by               a specific protein transport carrier.  The aim of this proposal                 is to identify and isolate this transport protein in order that                 its structure and function can be studied.",
