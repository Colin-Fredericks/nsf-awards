 "awd_abstract_narration": "Friction in tribological systems often causes vibrations. The                   question to be answered by this exploratory study is whether it is              feasible to turn this process around - to affect and control friction           in a mechanical system by introducing vibrational energy into the               system, in parallel with the friction forces. Potential applications            include methods for keeping idle bearings from freezing up, very low            friction bearings and slides, very high friction brakes, and improved           feasiblity of processing difficult materials.  Two main frequency               regimes will be tested-the characteristic vibrational  frequency of             the test system itself and the characteristic frequency of the                  friction forces in the contact zone.  Care will be taken to eliminate           any extrinsic vibrations.  If the results of this initial                       experimental study are encouraging additional theoretical and                   experimental work will be planned.",
