 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ionosphere at high latitudes is disturbed by a variety                 of energy inputs from the magnetosphere, including particle                     precipitation, electric fields, and the flow of electrical                      currents, all ultimately originating with the interaction of the                solar wind and the outer boundary of the magnetosphere.                         Ionospheric density irregularities and drifts are present over a                wide range of scale sizes and velocities.  The deployment of                    modern radar systems, with sophisticated computer diagnostics and               data compression capabilities, allows these irregularities and                  drifts to be measured as part of a thorough study of the high                   latitude ionosphere, and provides information for the solution of               practical problems associated with radio communication at high                  latitudes.  This award is for continued support of the Johns                    Hopkins University radar at Goose Bay, Labrador, in conjunction                 with satellite measurements, other ground based instruments in                  the area, and a similar radar in Antarctica.  The Antarctic radar               is at Halley Bay, the magnetic conjugate point, i.e., the place                 where the magnetic field lines that thread the Goose Bay                        ionosphere, and extend out many earth radii into the                            magnetosphere, return to the southern hemisphere ionosphere.  The               currents, electric fields, and particles from the magnetosphere                 tend to extend along field lines and be the same at conjugate                   points, but the differences give important information on the                   coupling between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere.",
