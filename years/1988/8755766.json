 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California, Davis proposes an interdisciplinary               program in biological and environmental sciences with a focus on                agricultural sciences. It combines a six week summer program, with a            school year follow-up endeavor for 11th and 12th grade students.  The           summer program, residential in nature, combines instructional                   activities in areas selected as central to biological/agricultural              disciplines with students research in a one-to-one relationship with            university researchers.  Research will be an amalgam of students'               individual interests and available institutional and personnel                  resources.  Students will receive close supervision and instruction on          research design, reporting and the use of university resources.                                                                                                 The school-year follow-up program will include a) student presentation          of research in the home school; b) a research update program on the UC          Davis campus; c) student presentation of the research paper at the              Science and Humanities Symposia of Northern and Southern California.                                                                                            Selection of participants will be based on factors including                    demonstrated ability in science and mathematics; limited educational            opportunities in the applicant's high school; a continued record of             interest and activity in sciences; completion of the eleventh grade             during the preceding year; economic conditions which might otherwise            preclude a qualified applicant's participation.  Special efforts will           be made to solicit applications from underrepresented qualified                 minority students.",
