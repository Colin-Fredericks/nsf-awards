 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cell-cell contact and cAMP are critical regulators of Dictyostelium        discoideum development.  Dr. Fontana has shown that cell-cell contact           evokes cAMP secretion and alters amoebal responsiveness to subsequent           applications of cAMP.  These observations provide a biochemical,                quantitatable assay for a contact-mediated event and suggest that, in           some instances, cell-cell contact may regulate development by altering          cAMP levels.  Her first objective involves the elucidation of the               mechanism through which cell-cell contact elicits these responses.  The         following will be examined to determine their involvement in the                transduction of the contact stimulus: the adenylate cyclase, a GTP-             binding protein, the ras protein, a cytoplasmic component, and IP3.  The        contact receptor and ligand will be identified using biochemical and            immunological methods.  The second objective is the implication of these        contact-mediated responses in the regulation of development.  Mutant            analysis will be employed.  The third objectiv is the characterization          of Dictyostelium in vivo cyclic nucleotide metabolism.  A technique             involving 18O labeling will be utilized.                                            Understanding the mechanisms by which chemical signals and cell-cell        contact regulate development in this primitive eukaryotic organism may          lead to a greater understanding of the mechanisms by which these                regulate development in humans.",
