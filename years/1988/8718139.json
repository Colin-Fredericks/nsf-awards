 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue monitoring and experimental                  manipulations of seed-eating animals and seed-producing plants in               the Chihuahuan Desert that have been conducted continuously since               1977.  The long-term records of rodents, birds, ants, and annual                plants will provide information on the response of individuals,                 populations, and communities both to natural temporal and spatial               variation and to the experimental perturbations.  Manipulations                 begun in 1977 are still being propogated through networks of                    direct and indirect interactions and having new effects on the                  system.  The study will:  1) continue to census granivore and                   plant populations using standardized techniques that have already               provided some of the most extensive and intensive long-term data                for any terrestrial ecosystem in North America; 2) convert plots                that have been assigned to relatively unproductive experiments to               additional replicates of the treatments that have had the most                  interesting effects, focusing attention on the mechanisms an                    dynamics of indirect interactions; and 3) work up the extensive                 data on rodents, emphasizing the relationships between the                      behavior of individuals, the dynamics of populations, and the                   organization of the entire assemblage of 11 common and several                  rare species.  The investigation is a classic example of long-                  term ecological research at the cutting-edge of community                       ecology.",
