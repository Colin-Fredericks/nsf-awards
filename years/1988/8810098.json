 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program is designed to localize two specific                      proteins within internal membrane systems of both the cell body                 and the nerve axon.  Localization of these proteins will                        elucidate the involvement of the nerve cells' internal membrane                 systems in the packaging of proteins destined for different                     target areas of the surface membrane or extracellular space.  The               two target proteins to be studied are : 1) the Na+ - K+ ATPase;                 and 2) acetylcholinesterase (AChE).  These proteins will be                     localized with the aid of specific antibody probes visualized by                light and electron microscopy.  These two proteins are important                in regulating the electrical and chemical activities associated                 with communication between nerve cells.  The membrane systems                   under study are both those of the cell body and of the axon.  In                the cell body, the membrane systems to be studied are involved in               the biosynthesis and packaging of membrane proteins or secretion                products.  In the axon, there are at least three distinct                       membrane systems whose functions or relationship are not known at               this time.  Investigations into the biosynthesis and transport of               these proteins are permitted by the recent production and                       characterization of specific antibodies to each that may be used                as probes to label each using a combination of light and electron               microscopic techniques.                                                                                                                                         Ultimately, the activities of this research program will provide                a map of the subcellular pathways along which differing molecular               forms of two macromolecules, crucially involved in nerve impulse                and synaptic transmission, are transported to their respective                  destinations and finally combined and inserted into their                       functional positions.  This investigation, using specific probes                for the distribution of each protein, will define the functional                relationship between morphologically differing membrane systems                 of the axon.  As a result of these studies we will gain a greater               understanding of the cellular mechanisms which regulate the life                cycle of these important macromolecules.***",
