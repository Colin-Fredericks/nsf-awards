 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a collaborative effort between William Emery at                 the University of Colorodo and Albert Bradley at Woods Hole                     Oceanographic Institution.  It is a feasibility study for                       developing an electronic bathythermograph (EBT) that would serve                a similar purpose as presently-used expendable XBTs.  A probe                   with sensors would be released from a moving ship.  It free-falls               through the water column, collecting and storing temperature and                pressure data to some specified depth.  The probe would then be                 spooled back in and retrieved by an attached synthetic line.                    After recovery, stored data would be dumped and the instrument                  prepared for additional deployments.  Anticipated advantages of                 the reusable EBT over the XBT are improved data quality from                    repeating use of the same sensors, direct measurment of pressure                as a function of depth, reduced logistic costs, and potential use               on volunteer observing ships.  The recent introduction and                      availability of very thin and strong, long-chain polymer line,                  suggests that such retrievable probes are now feasible.  The                    project will result in a technical feasibility report, and might                possibly be the mechanical engineering proof-of-concept basis for               a full instrument development proposal.",
