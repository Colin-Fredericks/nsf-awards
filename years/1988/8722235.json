 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global climatic changes affect polar regions, specifically the                  arctic,in disproportionately large ways, producing substantial                  variations inthe extent of terrestrial and marine ice sheets, of sea            ice, and ofocean temperatures.  These variations have not only                  occurred overgeologic time scales, but are thought to occur over much           shorter timescales in response to the varying carbon dioxide content            of theatmosphere, as an example.                                                                                                                                Understanding the responses of major ice sheets to the climaticchanges          that have occurred is one of the primary objectives of                          marinepaleoenvironmental research.  Such understanding is based on              thedetailed study of the sedimentation history of the region,                   whichincludes the location of ancient and modern sediment pathways,             theexamination of closely spaced samples from high quality                      sedimentcores, and the regional correlation of environmental events.                                                                                            This project will apply these techniques in a study of the extent               andtiming of the decay of the northern hemisphere pleistocene ice               sheet.                                                                                                                                                          The deglaciation of the high Canadian Arctic is quite speculative               atthis time.  Hypotheses that have been advanced range from the                 areabeing ice-free to being covered by the Innuitian Ice Sheet which            hadmerged with the Greenland Ice Sheet to the east, and the                     LaurentideIce Sheet to the south.  The key to resolving this question           lies inidentifying a tracer that may be unambiguously related to                advances andretreats of an actual ice sheet.  This project will                 examine theoccurrences of high coarse-fraction abundance in selected            sedimentsamples (indicative of general deglaciation) in conjunction             withkaolinite-rich layers (indicative of a Queen Elizabeth Islands              sourceregion).  A detailed Carbon-14 analysis program will provide a            precisetime scale.",
