 "awd_abstract_narration": "An overall understanding of the processes controlling the                       biogeochemistry of the Amazon River mainstem requires                           consideration of a series of scales.  This project addresses                    primarily those processes operating at the fast- to intermediate                dynamic control of the linkages between the mainstem and                        floodplain.  Based on a series of research cruises the research                 team will:                                                                      1) Use a rating-curve approach to define material hydrographs at                the primary sampling stations.                                                  2) Predict fluxes for the respective elements.                                  3) Calculate the residence time of water on the floodplain, with                inundation patterns determined by Landsat imagery.                              4) Use the routing model to provide boundary conditions to a two-               dimensional hydrodynamic model.                                                 5) Use this model to drive a sediment transport/exchange model,                 calibrated with data from field sites validated with field data                 and with turbidity patterns visible on Landsat MSS images.                      6) Use a series of isotope tracers of organic mater to identify                 sources responsible for exchange.                                               7) Examine potential DOC adsorption mechanisms.                                 8) Refine the within river respiration rate estimates.                          9) Identify what class of compounds may be the substrates by                    measuring changes in biomarkers.                                                10) Evaluate the overall potential of these compounds using the                 hydrodynamic model as a driver.                                                                                                                                 The research team is an excellent one with a long history of                    productive collaboration.  Facilities at the grantee institution                are excellent, and accommodations at the Brazilian operations                   center.  Relations with Brazilian scientific partners are long-                 standing and excellent.",
