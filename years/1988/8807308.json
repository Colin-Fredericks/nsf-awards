 "awd_abstract_narration": "The regulation of carbon metabolism in non-photosynthetic tissues               (sinks) of higher plants is poorly understood, despite the fact that            these tissues constitute the bulk of the world's supply of food.                Photosynthetically derived carbon is generally translocated to sinks as         sucrose but, once unloaded, may be processed in different ways.                 Depending on the type of sink, the imported sucrose may be used                 predominately in biosynthesis and respiration, or stored, either as             sucrose or starch.  Little is known about the biochemical mechanisms by         which this partitioning is accomplished.  These studies will make               significant contributions to the understanding of carbon metabolism in          sink tissues, an area of plant biology in urgent need of development.                                                                                           Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6P2), a regulatory molecule shown to              control carbon partitioning in photosynthetic cells, may play a related         role in sinks as well.  The concentration of F2,6P2 is determined by the        activities of fructose 6-phosphate, 2-kinase (F6P, 2K) and fructose             2,6-bisphosphatase (F2,6P2ase), which synthesize and degrade F2,6P2.            The Fellow will purify F6P,2K and F2,6P2ase from a variety of sink types        to determine whether differences in the properties of the enzymes               correlate with different patterns of carbon partitioning.                                                                                                       With the purified preparations, the affinity of the enzymes for their           substrates and their sensitivity to metabolite effectors will be                measured.  It will be determined whether sink F6P,2K and F2,6P2ase              reside on separate proteins as in leaves, and tested whether the enzymes        might be regulated by covalent modification (for example,                       phosphorylation).",
