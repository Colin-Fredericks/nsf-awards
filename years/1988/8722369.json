 "awd_abstract_narration": "The collapse of shell structures often occurs suddenly, is localized            in character, and almost always associated with plasticity in the               prebuckling or post-collapse state.  The major objective of the                 research is to develop an analytical model which can be used for the            study of such localized collapse of shells.  Though the model is to             be developed initially in the context of rotational shells, possible            extensions to other types of shells are in sight and will be spelled            out.  The nonlinearities are assumed to be restricted to a definable            region of the shell.  In this region, general quadrilateral                     degenerate shell elements incorporating large deflection and                    plasticity effects are to be used to capture the localization of                deformation.  Elsewhere the behavior is simply described using                  axisymmetric shell elements.  Connecting these types of elements, are           the transitional elements which have 'line nodes' along their common            boundaries into rotational shell elements and point nodes elsewhere.            A dynamic analysis is to be incorporated to trace the snapthrough               type of collapse which is invariably accompanied by plasticity.  It             is anticipated that the research will shed some new light on the                mechanics of localized collapse of shells and be of significant value           in the technology of analysis and design of shell structures.",
