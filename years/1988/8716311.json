 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable a group of physicists under the direction of             Professor Rufus H. Ritchie of the University of Tennessee at                    Knoxville to collaborate with Professor Fuminori Fujimoto of the                University of Tokyo, Japan in a study of the dynamic interactions               of electrons and ions with condensed matter.  The study will be                 carried out at both theoretical and experimental levels in                      complementary programs in the U.S. and in Japan.  In the U.S., the              theoretical work will be based on a quantum mechanical,                         many-particle, self-energy analysis of the interactions of                      electrons and swift ions with matter.  The experimental effort will             focus on the study of dynamic processes by the new technique of                 scanning tunneling microscopy.  The Japanese theoretical study will             focus on quantum many-particle properties of charged particles in               collision with electrons and ion cores in passing through condensed             matter.  The concurrent experimental program will consist of                    studies of particulate channeling and ion interactions with solids,             with emphasis on electronic transitions in the solids and on the                projectile.                                                                                                                                                     An understanding of the interactions between energetic particles                and condensed matter is of significant practical importance in many             areas of modern physics, including for example, surface diagnostic              physics, radiation physics, molecular ion structure determinations,             and accelerator-based atomic physics.  Dr. Ritchie's group at the               University of Tennessee and Dr. Fujimoto's group at the University              of Tokyo bring extensive and complementary expertise and equipment              to bear on this research project.",
