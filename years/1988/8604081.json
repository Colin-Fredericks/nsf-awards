 "awd_abstract_narration": "A 500 MHz NMR spectrometer and computer system will be acquired                 for use in structural biology.  New software will be developed                  for analyzing NMR data and utilizing that data to determine the                 structure of proteins in solution.  Additional studies concern                  the relationship between the linear or primary sequence of                      proteins and the secondary and tertiary fording of proteins in                  three dimensional space.  NMR data will be used to evaluate                     schemes for understanding the potential conformations of                        identical sequences of amino acids contained in different larger                amino acid sequences.  The structure and dynamics of short DNA                  oligomeric chains and of small molecules that interact with DNA                 and protein will also be studied.  The information derived from                 the NMR experiments will be used in conjunction with distance                   geometry calculations, energy refinement calculations and                       computer graphics to generate molecular structures in solution in               greater detail than is presently known.  The information will be                compared to our knowledge of the static structure of proteins and               DNA known from X-ray diffraction data, and will lead to a better                understanding of the relationship between architecture and the                  functional role of these macromolecules.",
