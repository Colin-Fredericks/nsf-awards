 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular                    Chemistry Program.  The research involves building molecules                    that mimic nature's ability to selectively complex and carry                    out highly selective reactions.  The model molecules are                        relatively small compared to enzymes but are built to simulate                  their selective behavior, based upon an understanding of the                    responsible factors.  Dr. Cram has been a pioneer in this work,                 it having culminated in his being awarded a Nobel Prize.                                                                                                        The goal is to understand structural recognition in                             complexation between organic compounds.  Molecular traffic                      control in biological systems depends centrally on structural                   recognition in complexation, and inspires study of complexation                 with simple non-biological systems.  Organic compounds with                     convergent binding sites (hosts) are designed and prepared to                   complex other organic compounds with complementary, divergent                   binding sites (guests).  The hypothesis is being tested \"that                   stronger and more specific complexation applies to host-guest                   partners whose intrinsic structures enforce an organization for                 binding prior to complexation (preorganization).\"  Structures                   of hosts and complexes derive from crystal structures, nuclear                  magnetic and mass spectra, and elemental analyses.  Free                        energies of complexation are correlated with host and guest                     structures.  Preorganization in hosts is obtained through                       assembly of rigid molecular modules to form enforced concave                    surfaces of molecular dimensions with saucer, bowl, cup, or                     vase-like shapes (cavitands).  Binding or solubilizing groups                   compose or protrude from their surfaces.  Molecular cells are                   constructed by multiply bonding at their rims two or more                       cavitands to give carcerands, whose enforced interiors imprison                 organic or inorganic guests, whose properties change with                       encapsulation.",
