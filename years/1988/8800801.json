 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is research on particle physics and                           cosmology.  The principal subject of research is the nature of                  possible \"dark (i.e., non-luminous) matter\" (DM) which may well                 be the main form of mass in the universe.  The research                         involves both further exploration of several \"cold\" DM                          scenarios, and also detailed study of the possibilities of                      detecting or constraining the properties of various                             hypothetical DM particles via laboratory and accelerator                        experiments, cosmic radiation, and further aalysis of Supernova                 1987a.  Another subject of research is the possibility that                     galaxy and cluster formation is triggered by loops of \"cosmic                   string;\" the project will study the detailed evolution of                       loops, and also investigate cosmic string models that are                       consistent with  a form of expansion of the universe that is                    called \"inflation\".  The project will also attempt to ascertain                 the nature of the DM and the initial conditions by detailed                     study of the dynamics of disk galaxies and of the evolution of                  galaxies and their clustering, in anticipation of extensive new                 data.  Finally, it will study the various theories of particle                  physics beyond the standard model both for their implications                   regarding the DM and for insights into the big unsolved                         problems of cosmology such as the value of the cosmological                     constant.                                                                            This project will help refine our theories of the large                    scale structure of the universe, the early moments of the                       universe, and the nature of up to 99% of the matter in the                      universe.",
