 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator plans to work on problems in                    mathematical analysis concerning the representation theory of                   Lie groups.  A suitable example of the latter is the group of                   rotations of a sphere.  Groups like this are important because                  they occur in many areas of mathematics ( e.g. geometry,                        differential equations,algebraic number theory, mathematical                    physics ) as groups of symmetries.  Representation theory allows                one to take advantage of symmetries in solving problems.                             The building blocks for representation theory are                          the irreducible representations, particularly the irreducible                   unitary representations.  The principal investigator will work                  toward classifying these representations for certain classes of                 Lie groups. More specifically, he will continue work on                         determining the character theory and unitarity of the unipotent                 representations of reductive groups. This will provide                          significant insight into the unitary dual and certain problems in               the theory of automorphic forms.",
