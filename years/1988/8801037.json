 "awd_abstract_narration": "Graduate student K. Christopher Beard proposes to study the                Plesiadapiformes, an important group of fossil mammals found,                   among other places, in the American West.  These extinct species                are considered by many to be early primates, though their                       evolutionary relationships to this and other mammal groups is a                 controversial subject.  In order to expand our understanding of                 this group, Mr. Beard will concentrate his efforts on an analysis               of post-cranial fossils.  These data on limb proportions and                    biomechanics will also shed light on controversies regarding the                life habits of early primates, specifically, whether they were                  arboreal or ground-dwelling.  These new data will be combined                   with information from the literature into an analysis of                        evolutionary relationships.                                                          Early primate evolution is far from well understood, and the               proposed research would add a new dimension to the information on               which our understanding is based.  New analyses of primate and                  other early mammmal relations will have wide impact on vertebrate               zoologists and on evolutionary biologists in general.",
