 "awd_abstract_narration": "Available mathematical methods for analyzing the demography             of plant and animal populations do not include the interactions                 of the sexes.  The tacit assumption is usually made that the                    population contains sufficient males to fertilize all mature                    females, so that the dynamics of the population are determined by               the abundance of the latter (this assumption is referred to as                  \"female dominance\").  This assumption is now known not to be                    universally true, and recent work has shown that including the                  sexes in demographic models can produce complicated and                         heretofore unexpected patterns of dynamics.                                             This research will investigate these patterns, using                    mathematical methods developed for the study of nonlinear                       dynamical systems.  The models to be studied will include age or                size classes of both males and females, and the possibility of                  competition for mates among individuals of the same sex but                     different ages.  The effects of including different models of the               mating process, alternative mating strategies, and the                          possibility of developmental sex change (a known phenomenon in                  some groups of plants and animals) will be addressed.                                   The results will have implications for the understanding and            management of populations in which the interaction of males and                 females is an important determinant of population dynamics.  They               may also be applicable to human demographic analysis.",
