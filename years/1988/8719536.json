 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emission of non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) from                       natural sources has been known for over two decades.  The major                 source is thought to be vegetation.  Other significant natural                  sources are marine algae, microbial activity in soils, natural                  gas seeps, the biomass burning.  Natural hydrocarbon emissions                  from plants play an important role in the generation of                         photochemical oxidants in the troposphere, but there are a                      number of uncertainties in regional and global inventories of                   these biogenic compounds.  Much of the uncertainty arises                       because there is a lack of precise data relating hydrocarbon                    emissions to key environmental variables that regulate such                     emissions from vegetation.  In addition, there is uncertainty                   about the chemical identification of a large fraction of                        biogenic hydrocarbons, and very little is known of the                          physiology or biochemistry of plant hydrocarbon production.                          This project will conduct laboratory studies to a) measure                 accurately the environmental variables controlling the                          biogenesis of isoprene and related NMHC in plants, b) provide                   new, chemical identification of emitted NMHC, and c) explore                    the role of micro organisms on leaf surfaces as sinks or                        sources of NMHC.  NMHC emissions form plants in environmentally                 controlled gas exchange chambers will be characterized by gas                   chromatography measurements, with identification of                             hydrocarbons by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.  By                       using plants representing major plant groups and ecosystems,                    NMHC emissions will be related to air temperature, light                        intensity, humidity, and carbon dioxide concentration, and                      algorithms relating emissions to these parameters will be                       developed.  A model will be developed to explain how and why                    plants emit isoprene and related NMHC, and to suggest the                       environmental regulation of such emissions.",
