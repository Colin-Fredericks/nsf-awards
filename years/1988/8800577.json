 "awd_abstract_narration": "CEDAR Improvements for the Sondrestrom Observatory                                   This proposal is to improve the ability of the Sondrestrom                 (Greenland) Radar Facility to meet the needs of its many users --               both radio and optical aeronomers.  The aspects of the                          observatory to be enhanced are the radar facility, the optical                  facility and communications.  First increased receiver                          sensitivity will improve the precision and time resolution of all               radar observations.  A higher transmitter pulse rate will enable                atmospheric radar studies to be conducted in the ionospheric D-                 region and in the mesosphere.  The addition of a site crew person               whose primary responsibility will be to monitor and maintain the                instruments collocated with the radar, especially the optical                   instruments, will improve significantly their reliability and                   usefulness.  The increased number of optical instruments has                    necessitated the need for more experiment space, which will be                  met by the addition of an appropriate trailer.  Finally,                        improvements in communications between the observatory and the                  rest of the world are planned.  These include developing                        electronic mail, file transfer, and, possibly, remote login                     capabilities using the telephone lines and packet-switched                      networks.",
