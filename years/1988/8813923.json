 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project are (1) to extend the variability                methods of seismic analysis to situations where the soil boundary               swiftness matrix is associated with an unbounded region, and (2) to             develop a set of nonlinear constitutive equations for the soil.  This           will make it possible to evaluate the effects of variation in the soil          constitutive properties on the seismic ground motions and hence on the          response of soil-(embedded) structure systems subjected to such ground          motions.  These results will be verified against Monte Carlo                    simulations.                                                                                                                                                    The algebraic complexities of the formulae depicting the higher-order           statistical approximations will be handled in a digital computer by             symbolic manipulation languages germane to artificial intelligence              procedures.  Automated sequential refinements of the final results of           the statistical correlations will be explored.                                                                                                                  A major effort will be expended to develop a computer code which                implements an appropriate stochastic equivalent linearization method            within the framework of a finite element analysis to achieve this               objective.  Efforts will also be made to develop analytical outlines            as to how the variability and nonlinear response analyses can be                combined.                                                                                                                                                       This project will seek to fully extend the applicability of                     stochastic methods in earthquake engineering so that the inherent               randomness and uncertainty existing in these problems can be                    rationally dealt with.",
