 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will characterize the structural forms, substrate                 specificities, enzyme reaction kinetics, and catalytic mechanisms of            action of a group of extracellular lignin peroxidases produced by               ligninolytic Streptomyces species.  It is also intended to express and          amplify expression of the lignin-induced peroxidase of Streptomyces             viridosporus by gene cloning in order to better define the role of              this lignin oxidizing enzyme in lignin degradation and solubilization.          The lignin-induced peroxidase gene of S. viridosporus will also be              compared for sequence homologies with the lignin peroxidase gene of             Phanerochaete chrysosporium using gene probes.                                                                                                                  This research will increase scientific understanding of how plant               residues are decomposed by microorganisms.  Ultimately, the knowledge           gained will lead to the development of economically viable                      technologies by which plant residues can be used to produce useful              chemicals biologically, and to new technologies for carrying out                industrial processes such as paper and chemical production using less           energy and producing less toxic chemical wastes as by-products.  In             turn, the research can, therefore, lead to a less energy intensive              industry in the United States, which will help to reduce our                    dependence on the burning of fossil fuels, a major source of the                carbon dioxide which is creating the greenhouse effect and undesirable          warming of the Earth.",
