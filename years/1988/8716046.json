 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is in support of a geological field trip to the Scotia               Arc of Antarctica as part of the U.S. contribution to the                       International Geological Congress which will be hosted by the                   United States in 1989.  The participation of Argentina and Chile                as co-hosts has been requested, as well as the co-sponsorship of                the Scientific Committee of Antarctic Research (International                   Council of Scientific Unions).  This will be the first                          professional geologic field trip to Antarctica.                                                                                                                 This geological field trip is significant for the wide                          dissemination of Antarctic geological knowledge and for the                     testing of over a decade's research into the paleoenvironmental                 and tectonic evolution of the Scotia Arc and Antarctic Peninsula.               This field trip is planned for the austral summer of 1988-89 on                 board the RV POLAR DUKE  and will bring together scientists expert              in all phases of comparable tectonic settings and geologic                      problems elsewhere in the world.                                                                                                                                The field trip is an important aspect of the Antarctic geosciences              and will point to new directions for future research in this                    important area.",
