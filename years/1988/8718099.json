 "awd_abstract_narration": "Using private and University of Pittsburgh funds, the Allegheny                 Observatory has purchased a Perkin Elmer 10-by-10 inch                          PDS measuring machine and computer facility.  However, as normally              supplied, the Perkin-Elmer machine provides precisions only                     slightly better than machines of a decade ago.  The full potential              of the machine is only realized with the installation of a laser                interferometer.  The National Science Foundation will support the               acquisition of this interferometer.                                                                                                                             A new program is planned with this machine that will provide:                   1) direct trigonometric measurements of a representative sample of              the stars making up the luminosity function within 100 parsecs of               the Sun, 2) accurate masses for most of the nearby binary stars,                3) accurate distances to most of the stars known to be within that              volume, and 4) a systematic search for unseen companions with                   masses down to that of Saturn.                                                                                                                                  The Observatory's 110,000 plate collection, as well as plates                   being obtained with the Thaw 30-inch refractor and a Keeler                     Ritchey-Chretien reflector, will be used with the upgraded PDS                  machine to attain the scientific goals.",
