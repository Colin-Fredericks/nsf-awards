 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is providing modern laboratory equipment to                   establish a contemporary cell and molecular plant science teaching              program.  Two upper-level laboratory courses are affected:  Plant               Physiology, and Plant Growth and Development.  Plant Physiology                 currently is undergoing complete renovation at the hands of the                 principal investigator (who was hired a year ago to fill the                    department's void in modern plant laboratory sciences).  Plant Growth           and Development is a new course, offered for the first time in 1987-            1988.                                                                                                                                                                The equipment is fitting out two entire laboratory courses in a            manner that allows students to observe fundamental principles in plant          biology and to gain experience in methodologies currently employed in           plant science laboratory research.  As direct result of this grant,             students are having an opportunity to utilize the following techniques          in their study of plant processes:  fluorescence and gas exchange at            the whole leaf/whole plant level, organella isolation and                       characterization, suborganella fractionation, polarographic gas assay           in solution, electrophoretic separation of proteins and quantification          by scanning densitometry, immunochemical assays including Western blots         and enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays, and in vitro translations.                                                                                                   Plant molecular and cell biology currently are areas of intense            research efforts which are generating a great deal of excitement.  An           objective of this project is to transmit some of that stimulation to            the local level.  Some of the equipment also is being used in other             upper-level laboratory courses by biology majors, a majority of whom            continue their formal education in either graduate or professional              schools.                                                                                                                                                             The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
