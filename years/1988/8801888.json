 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Prof. Ismael             Castelazo of Arizona State University (ASU) and Prof. Rafael Kelly              of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico                 City, Mexico.  ASU and UNAM have groups of researchers currently                investigating position and force control techniques for robot                   manipulators.  The objective of this project is to compare and                  evaluate the relative advantages of nonlinear control techniques                studied at ASU with the adaptive control techniques pursued at UNAM,            in an effort to develop a unified control strategy that takes into              account the best characteristics of each method in particular                   operating conditions and for different manipulator designs.  Special            attention will be paid to the following specific areas of robot                 manipulator controls:  a) force control; b) position and velocity               control; and c) compensation of nonlinear and coupling effects.                 Analytical studies will be followed by real-time implementation in              complementary facilities at ASU and UNAM.                                                                                                                       Control of robotic manipulators is a very active and important                  research field, not only because of the immediate benefits in                   industrial productivity obtained from the use of robots, but also               because these sophisticated devices are an ideal test bed to                    investigate modeling and control techniques for servomechanisms in              general.  The potential for significant advances is enhanced by                 bringing together groups of researchers with complementary skills,              approaches, and facilities to work on an important problem of much              current interest.",
