 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site                     award.   The 10-week summer research program is designed to                     enlarge the very small numbers of minority students entering the                field of experimental psychology.  Ten students between their                   junior and senior years will be enrolled.  At least five students               will be from colleges with substantial black undergraduate                      enrollments.                                                                                                                                                    In this program, students will be assigned to laboratories in                   which they will help design, carry out and analyze the results of               a research project, under the supervision of a regular full-time                faculty member in the Syracuse Psychology Department.  Students                 will make both oral presentations and written reports of their                  projects.  Advisors will evaluate reports through written                       comments sent to the students after the end of the program.                                                                                                     Students will evaluate the program by completing forms                          distributed at the middle and end of the summer.  Information                   about actual career choices and the impact of the summer program                on those choices, will be solicited from students, home                         departments and advisors at the end of the academic year                        following the program.",
