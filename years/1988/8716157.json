The seminar will be organized by Prof. Doyle McKey of the                       University of Miami, Coral Gables, and Dr. Finn Kjellberg of the                Unite de Biologie des Populations et des Peuplements, National                  Center for Scientific Research, Montpellier, France.                                                                                                            The peculiar reproductive biology of the genus Ficus,                           tied to pollination by species-specific fig wasps, limits most of               its representatives to regions where both the plant and wasps can               be reproductively active year-round, unrestricted by cold seasons.              Most of the species are therefore located in tropical                           environments.  However, in areas of the Mediterranean and in                    subtropical southern Florida, outlying species of Ficus can be                  found, despite a marked cold season.   This seminar will explore                parallels and contrasts between adaptations of these species to                 seasonal environments.  Topics will also include the relationships              between adjustments in reproductive phenology and other aspects of              fig and fig-wasp biology.  This seminar will be an important step               in coordinating research efforts worldwide on fig/fig wasp                      mutualism, a system that has contributed significantly to                       theoretical and empirical studies in population biology.",
