 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry                        Program supports basic research in Organometallic                               Photochemistry.  This research supported by the program is                      aimed at future efforts in solar conversion and photocatalysis.                                                                                                 Pulsed laser flash photolysis (FP), through which                               kinetically-labile species in solution implicated in important                  thermal reactions of substituted metal carbonyls and silenes                    may be generated, will be employed to probe intermediate                        reaction steps.  Rates of reaction will be investigated by both                 UV/visible and IR spectroscopy and as a function of variable                    high pressure (FP/HP) to 200 MPa. The FP/IR technique, which                    employs a line-tuneable IR diode laser analyzing beam, is under                 continuing development in the project. It will afford                           high-resolution carbonyl stretching spectra through which                       bonding properties in metal carbonyl transients can be probed.                  Successful demonstration of FP/HP which affords volumes of                      activation will be particularly useful in the elucidation of                    mechanisms of reaction for photochemically-generated metal                      carbonyl intermediates where corresponding thermal reactions                    take place via interchange pathways. The energetics of specific                 reactions of photoproduced coordinatively-unsaturated metal                     carbonyls with halogenated solvents to form X-to-metal                          coordinate bonds, and with aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon                   solvents to form three-center C-H-to-metal bonds, will be                       probed. FP/IR will also be employed to investigate trans-cis                    isomerization in substituted coordinatively-unsaturated metal                   carbonyls and will be extended also to investigations of                        \"trapping\" reactions of silenes in which the Si-H stretching                    frequencies will be monitored.",
