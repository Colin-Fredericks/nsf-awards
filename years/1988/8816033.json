 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to study the feasibility of using             neural networks as the basis for intelligent and robust control of              flexible structures.  Currently, implementation of modern control               systems is based on sequential processing of state equations as                 opposed to the massively parallel processing architecture (neural               network) of the human brain.  As systems become more complex, the               ability to control them by traditional sequential control methods               becomes limited.  Parallel processing architecture is inherent in the           recently developed technology of neural networks.  It offers the                potential for addressing the limitations associated with traditional            sequential control methods.  There are three potentially powerful               characteristics associated with neural networks.  They are: (1) the             ability to learn and make decisions based on an optimization                    criteria; (2) the ability to perform a recognition task under                   uncertain conditions and with incomplete information: and (3) a high            processing speed.  This project will study whether these                        characteristics can be utilized in solving a flexible structure                 control problem.  The three phases of the research include                      development of a neural space representation for complex systems,               formulation of the control system structure in terms of the neural              network structure, and implementation of the results on the control             of a flexible beam.",
