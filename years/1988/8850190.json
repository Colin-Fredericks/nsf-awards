 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide a summer residential enrichment experience            for thirty gifted and high potential high school juniors in the central         part of the United States.  The four-week project has three components:         (1) a two week workshop concentrating on career exploration, science            and engineering ethics, and research methodology and engineering                design; (2) a one week engineering or science research project                  involvement; and (3) one week of \"shadowing\" a scientist or engineer in         industry.                                                                                                                                                       The workshop component will use a variety of instructional methods,             including case studies and problem solving sessions.  During the                research component, students will apply what they learned in the                workshop to a research setting as part of a research team.  Students            will complement the career exploration portion of the workshop with             their industrial shadowing component.  Both the research and shadowing          experiences will emphasize the importance of ethics in science and              engineering.  Academic year follow-up activities include monthly                activities to be completed by students in their schools, and two group          meetings at WSU.                                                                                                                                                Minority and women students will be recruited for this project though           existing high school minority and gifted student programs offered by            the College of Engineering.",
