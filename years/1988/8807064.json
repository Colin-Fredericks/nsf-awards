 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid development and intensification of winter                        cyclones in coastal regions presents a major weather                            forecasting problem.  Along the East Coast of the United                        States, the development of cyclonic storms and frontal systems                  often occurs along the coastal region of the Carolinas.  These                  weather systems may lead to severe weather in the heavily                       populated Northeast Corridor in the form of  freezing rain,                     heavy snowfall, blizzards and extensive coastal erosion.  A                     complex interaction of cold continental air, warm ocean                         currents, traveling atmospheric disturbances and local                          geography all appear to contribute to the rapid development of                  these systems; however, the processes are not well understood                   and the phenomena are often poorly forecast.                                         In January-March 1986 a cooperative research project to                    study winter storms in this region was held by a consortium of                  universities and Federal agencies.  Entitled GALE (Genesis of                   Atlantic Lows Experiment), the project was designed to provide                  detailed information on the role of air-sea interaction,                        planetary boundary-layer processes and mesoscale meteorological                 processes.  As one of the investigators of the GALE, the                        Principal Investigator was instrumental in designing and                        executing the experiment.                                                            This research will extend initial analyses of data                         obtained during the GALE.  Preliminary work reveals that the                    mesoscale structure is prevalent within the synoptic field and                  can better explain the observed precipitation and local weather                 than can the synoptic field.  There is evidence, however, that                  mesoscale features occur in predictable patterns governed by the                topography and synoptic-scale flow.  The objectives of the                      research are to continue to identify and analyze mesoscale                      features in the atmospheric boundary layer over the near-shore                  waters and adjacent coastal plain and to explore the time-                      evolution of these features and their interactions with                         synoptic-scale systems especially as such interactions affect                   the precipitation process.",
