 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work seeks to document the existence of the laminar flame                  speed at constant pressure and the conditions under which its                   existence is possible for a range of common fuels.  The method of               approach involves detailed velocity and temperature measurements                at the tip and sides of a laminar premixed bunsen flame.                        Comparison of the flame speeds in these two regions, under proper               conditions, yields the laminar flame speed at constant pressure.                Velocity measurements will be accomplished by use of a particle                 streak technique while temperature measurements, obtained by fine               thermocouples, will be supported by either sodium line reversal,                Rayleigh scattering or a laser-induced fluorescence technique.                                                                                                  The motivation for this project is primarily that there may exist               a fundamental laminar flame propagation phenomenon that has been                largely overlooked and that the resulting flame speed may help to               explain in part why the turbulent flame speed is so much larger                 than the laminar flame speed.  Such fundamental observations may                lead to a reformulation of some of the basic kinetic rates                      presently used throughout predictive combustion models.",
