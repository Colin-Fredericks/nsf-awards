 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is to optimize conditions for germination of the                    sexually formed macrocysts of Dictyostelium discoideum.  We plan                to                                                                              1) Screen wild isolates for pairs making macrocysts which                       germinate quickly and at a high rate.                                           2) Select mutant strains which increase germination.                            3) Accelerate germination with enzymes which digest the                         macrocyst wall and with pheromonal factors from other                           germinating macrocysts.                                                         The goal is to achieve at least 10% germination of                              macrocysts after 6 weeks of dormancy, a rate which has proved                   adequate for routine use with other species.  Genetic                           experiments which use macrocyst system will not be attempted                    during the period of this project.                                                                                                                              Dictyostelium has been used for studies in development for a                    number of years.  But its potential has never been realized                     because rapid genetic methods for obtaining high-frequency                      recombination within a linkage group do not exist.  The                         successful completion of this project would be of great                         service to the scientific community and a contribution to                       the development of Dictyostelium as an experimental genetic                     system.",
