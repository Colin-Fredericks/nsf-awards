The work is performed by a                       collaboration of T. Parish at the University of Wyoming and D.                  Bromwich at Ohio State University.                                                                                                                              Cold air runs down the several converging gaps in the mountains                 that form the coastline near Terra Nova Bay.  The resulting                     katabatic winds are among the strongest and most persistent winds               in the world.  The proposers have collected data for the past                   several years from a variety of sources, including instrumented                 aircraft measurements, automatic weather stations, airborne                     photography of snow formations and satellite imagery.  This work                will continue the analysis of existing data and the continued                   collection of additional data from satellites and the automatic                 weather stations.  Models will be developed to attempt to account               for the observed winds.                                                                                                                                         Some of the automatic weather station data are collected in                     conjunction with the Italian Antarctic research base at Terra Nova              Bay.",
