 "awd_abstract_narration": "Michael Hurley will carry out research in dynamical systems.               In particular he will study cellular automata. These are related                to the magnetic storage of data. Hurley's objective is to                       investigate the mathematical explanations of various recent                     empirical observations. One reason for interest in cellular                     automata is that some of them exhibit self-organizing behavior.                 In mathematical terms this suggests the existence of attractors.                     A cellular automaton can be thought of as a map on doubly                  infinite sequences which commutes with shifts. Hurley will study                the dynamics of such maps. Self-organization manifests itself in                the observation that random sequences become more highly                        patterned under repeated iterations and the asymptotic pattern is               independent of the original sequence. The two major goals of                    Hurley's research are to understand the hierarchy of the                        collection of attractors of an automaton and to describe the                    dynamics of its restriction to its interesting attractors.",
