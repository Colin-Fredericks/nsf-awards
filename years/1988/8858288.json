 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses a number of topics in the general area of heat          and mass transfer.  One effort considers the high heat fluxes and               enhancement techniques to increase the maximum measured heat transfer.          This problem will be pursued in relation to the boiling of impinging            liquid jets, with the general intention of generating the greatest              heat transfer rates possible.  A key objective is to determine what,            if any, maximum exists for the energy transfer by phase change.                 Another area for this year's work is an analysis of the effects of              thermal radiation on multilayer Rayleigh-Benard instability.  A                 continuing study concerns the effects of strongly stabilizing                   stratification on heat transfer in turbulent flow.  Large density               gradients suppress turbulent heat convection, in a process                      antithetical to natural convection.  Studies of the coagulation of              aerosols in turbulent flows will also be initiated, with the objective          of obtaining reliable data on coagulation rates under given turbulent           conditions.                                                                                                                                                     The high flux studies will influence the handling of heat at high               power densities.  If successful, they will provide the means of                 cooling such high flux systems as fusion reactors and high power laser          mirrors.  The stability studies are directly relevant to flat-plate             solar collectors and will enable more efficient designs to be                   implemented.  The stratified turbulence studies are of fundamental              importance to the understanding of transport processes in the                   atmosphere and oceans, as well as to a number of engineering                    situations.  Control of the stratification in a fluid (viz., the                density gradient) enables control of heat losses.  The aerosol studies          address a fundamental issue in particle transport and have many                 potential applications to engineering.",
