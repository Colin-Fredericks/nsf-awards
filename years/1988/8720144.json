 "awd_abstract_narration": "A person, without benefit of seeing, can come to know about                     certain properties of objects by wielding and shaking them.                     Similarly, he or she can come to know about certain properties of               unseen surfaces by striking them with a hand-held implement.                    These instances of knowing about the surrounding environment                    through the use of the body, known as haptic perception, are                    based on mechanical forces that distort the body's tissues in                   complex ways.  Presumably, for each perceived environmental                     property, there is a specific mechanical property.  Identifying                 these mechanical properties, and understanding exactly how people               use them to measure spatial characteristics of the adjacent                     environment, pose significant challenges.  These experiments will               examine how people use the inertia tensor as the mechanical basis               for the haptic perception of the lengths, shapes, and                           orientations of unseen objects wielded by hand, and they will                   examine how people use the resultant of reactive forces as the                  mechanical basis for the haptic perception of the distance                      between struck surfaces.  This research will also examine                       patterns of wielding, looking for a relation between the                        particular way an object is wielded and the object property the                 person is attempting to measure.  The participants in the                       experiments will respond by adjusting visible, moveable surfaces                to quantify the perceived properties.  Results could provide                    insights valuable in the design of sensory and motor prostheses,                robotic limbs, and \"smart\" remote-sensing instruments.",
