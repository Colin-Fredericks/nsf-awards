 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neural impulses carrying somatosensory information to the                    brain arise from many sources.  Several of the pathways carrying                such information include the ventrobasal nucleus as the last                    relay station before reaching the cerebral cortex.  For this                    reason, the ventrobasal nucleus is a candidate as a somatosensory               modulator.  The ability to modulate the flow of somatosensory                   information has long been believed to be an important component                 of such phenomena as selective attention and arousal.  This                     project will be a study of the anatomy of the major modulatory                  inputs to the ventrobasal nucleus: an excitatory input from the                 part of the cerebral cortex devoted to the somatosensory system,                an inhibitory influence from the thalamic reticular nucleus and                 several inputs from the reticular formation of the brainstem.                   The studies are being done on brains from rats because the                      neuronal circuitry of the rat ventrobasal nucleus is relatively                 simple for a mammal.                                                               The procedures will include injecting tracers into the                       somatosensory cortex and the three areas of the brainstem                       reticular formation.  These tracers will be transported into                    corticothalamic and brainstem nerves, allowing the pathways to be               visualized on microscopic examination.  Tracers will also be                    injected directly into thalamic reticular neurons, allowing them                to be seen over their entire extent.  Thus, the terminations and                synaptic connections of nerves in the ventrobasal nucleus will be               traced for the first time.  This information will provide                       important leads for future functional studies of the role of the                ventrobasal nucleus in modulating the flow of somatosensory                     information to the cortex.",
