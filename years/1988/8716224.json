 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates the mechanisms of calcium action in                  plant cells.  Calcium is a very important regulatory molecule in                all eukaryotes.  It is thought to play a role as an intracellular               messenger that couples physiological responses to external                      stimuli.  The calcium binding proteins have been extensively                    studied in animals.  In this project, the potential targets of                  calcium action will be investigated in plants.  The goal of the                 research is to advance our understanding of how calcium mediates                the effects of environmental stumuli on plant cells.                                                                                                            The green alga Mougeotia has been selected as the experimental                  organism because it is an attractive biological model of calcium-               dependent regulation in plants.  The approach will involve                      purification and characterization of the molecular targets of                   calcium in Mougeotia: calcium-stimulated proteins and enzymes.                  The focus will be on a recently discovered calcium stimulated                   protein kinase of Mougeotia.  The purification and                              characterization of the protein kinase will be carried out.                     Particular emphasis will be on the elucidation of the molecular                 basis of calcium regulation by identifying the calcium-binding                  effector molecules that regulate the activity.  Also, in order to               determine the role of this kinase in Mougeotia, in vitro and in                 vivo phosphorylation assays will be used to identify the                        substrates of the protein kinase.  The effects of phosphorylation               on the in vitro activities of these substrates will be assessed.                The changes in in vivo substrate phosphorylation levels under                   conditions that trigger or suppress calcium-dependent responses                 also will be determined.//",
