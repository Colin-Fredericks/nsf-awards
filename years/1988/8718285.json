 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is designed to identify and explain systematic                    changes in causal attributions over time.  Past research has                    indicated that the explanations people give for their own and                   others' behaviors often are different if the attributions are                   assessed immediately after the task of several days afterward.                  Consistent with past work on attributional phenomena, several                   motivational and cognitive explanations for these effects are                   proposed.  The motivational explanations posit that people forget               reasons for behavior in self-flattering ways, leading to more                   ego-flattering attributions over time.  One cognitive explanation               is that attributions become simplified over time, resulting in                  the exaggeration of differences seen immediately after the task.                Two other cognitive variables that would seem to have an impact                 upon changes in attributions over time are the salience of the                  attributionally-relevant material, and the consistency of the                   material with the attributor's existing cognitive structures.                   Eight experiments will examine one or more of these explanations                each.  At times the experiment has been designed to test two                    competing explanations for the predicted effect.  However, the                  combined findings from the series of proposed investigations is                 expected to provide evidence for the role of all of these                       proposed mediators in the systematic changes in attributions over               time.",
