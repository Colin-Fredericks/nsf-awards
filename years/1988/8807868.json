 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Big Science\" in which scientific research most typically must be               carried out by a large team of scientists and technicians and                   which frequently is organized around extraordinarily expensive                  and large instruments has been a part of some sciences for                      centuries.  The great expeditions of exploration of the 18th and                19th centuries -- Darwin's voyage on the Beagle, for example, or                the Lewis and Clarke Expedition or the voyages of discovery of                  Captain Cooke in the South Pacific -- are in a sense \"big                       science\" projects.  The large telescopes built in the 19th and                  early 20th centuries represent another kind of \"big science.\"                   The current paradigm of big science, however, is represented by                 the giant particle accelerators in high energy physics.  In                     truth, however, big science is becoming pervasive throughout                    science and it has become increasingly clear that to establish a                more effective policy for science, we need a better understanding               how \"big science\" works and how it affects the social                           organization of science.                                                                                                                                        Historians of science have increasingly become interested in the                development of big science since World War II and there is now a                substantial group of scholars at work on topics in this area.                   Dr. Peter Galison, one of the leaders of this area of study in                  the history of science, has organized a working conference in                   order to compare and synthesize findings from several different                 case studies.  From these case studies, he hopes to discuss                     methodological issues and the wider implications of this work,                  and to bring together science administrators and historians of                  business and technology with historians of science in order to                  gain a broader perspective on this problem.  The conference will                be held August 25 to 27 at Stanford University.  The results will               be published.",
