 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Hawkins is a new investigator under the Presidential Young                  Investigator Award from the Organic and Macromolecular                          Chemistry Program.  Under this will be studied the development                  of new organic synthetic methods using organometallic reagents.                 These will increase our capacity to synthesize efficiently the                  complex molecules used in modern medicine and agriculture.                                                                                                      For the first project, metal carbonyls will be treated with                     organic substrates containing compatible nucleophilic and                       electrophilic sites.  Addition of the nucleophilic moiety to                    the carbon of coordinated carbon monoxide should generate a                     metal nucleophile in proximity to the now pendant electrophilic                 moiety.  The resulting complex will be set up for cyclization                   to a metallacycle, which may then reductively eliminate the                     desired selectively carbonylated organic product.  Epoxy                        alcohols, epoxy amines, and sulphonium ylides will be examined                  as the bifunctional organic substrates.  The anticipated                        reaction with epoxides corresponds to an aldol synthon where                    the starting epoxide's geometry controls the product's relative                 stereochemistry.  Epoxy amines may accordingly give                             beta-lactams with stereochemical control  The sulphonium ylide                  substrates may provide a new route to transition metal ketene                   complexes.  The second project will involve the synthesis,                      resolution, and application of chiral dihaloboranes containing                  pi-bases.  A substrate possessing both Lewis basic and                          pi-acidic sites such as an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester should                 bind to these catalysts via simulataneous synergistic Lewis                     acid-base and pi-acid base interactions.  The constraints                       imposed by this two-point binding may cause one face of the                     olefin to be selectively blocked.  Accordingly, the other face                  will be open to approach by reagents.  Dienes will be tested                    here; displacement of the corrdinated pi-base by an incoming                    diene may result in an asymmetric Diels Alder reaction.  No                     longer containing a pi-acid for a second binding point, the                     cyclohexene product should be displaced from the catalyst by                    the two-point binding starting material.  The catalyst                          structures will be varied in order to optimize this enzyme-like                 scenario.  Methods for the stereospecific vicinal                               bismethylation of a double bond will be explored in a third                     project.  Coordination of an olefinic substrate to a                            heterobimetallic bis-mu-methylene complex may lead to insertion                 into one of the metal-carbon bonds forming a                                    1,3-dimetallacyclohexane.  This species may then reductively                    eliminate a metallacyclopentane which can be protonolyzed to                    the desired bismethylated product.  Mo-Co and Mo-Fe complexes                   will be studied in this vein.",
