 "awd_abstract_narration": "They propose to study several important questions about phonons                 in amorphous and crystalline solids, mainly through thermal                     conductivity measurements.  One of these questions is that of the               heat flow in amorphous solids in the temperature range 10 - 300                 K, with the goal of understanding the transition of the phonon                  picture to that of a random walk of the elastic energy.  They                   will also continue their work on disordered crystals displaying                 glass-like thermal properties, in order to test several models                  that have been advanced as explanations.  They will use these                   models in an attempt at identifying other disordered crystals                   displaying glass-like properties.  Their ultimate goal is                       to apply their knowledge to amorphous solids, and to understand                 their excitations.  They will also propose an investigation of                  phonon scattering at crystal surfaces, in order to understand and               identify important scattering mechanisms.  Here, their goal is to               use phonons as sensitive low energy probes for surfaces.",
