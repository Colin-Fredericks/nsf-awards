 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal aims at studying the mode of regulation of                        catabolic and anabolic genes in Pseudomonas with a view to                      determining which nucleotide sequences are critical for the                     transcription of downstream gene(s).  The systems to be studied                 comprise the structural and regulatory genetic regions of (i)                   the clc cluster, a group of plasmid-borne genes involved in the                 degradation of Chlorocatechol; (ii) the catBC operon, a                         tightly-linked cluster of two chromosomal genes involved in the                 degradation of catechol; and (iii) the alg cluster, a group of                  chromosomal genes involved in the biosynthesis of a                             polysaccharide alginate.  We propose to delineate the critical                  nucleotides in the upstream regions of the clcABD, catBC and                    algD gene clusters by altering specific nucleotides at various                  locations by site directed mutagenesis and then examining the                   effects of such alterations on the expression of the downstream                 genes.  In order to detect other critical nucleotides at other                  locations, nonspecific mutagenesis will be used to alter                        upstream nucleotides at random and the effects of such                          alterations will be noted.  Since many regulatory genes                         controlling structural gene expression in a positive manner are                 known to interact at upstream sequences between 50 and 100                      nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation site, the                  products of algR, clcR and catR genes will be purified after                    hyperproduction and their interaction with the upstream                         sequences at -50 to -100 regions will be studied by                             footprinting and electrophoretic protein DNA binding assays.                                                                                                    These experiments should provide us with a wealth of                            information on the nature of gene regulation in Pseudomonas, a                  bacterial species which is occasionally a human pathogen, in                    some cases an important plant pathogen, and in other cases is                   being exploited to an increasing degree for industrial                          purposes.",
