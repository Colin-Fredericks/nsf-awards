 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Presidential Young Investigator Award project is in the                    general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the                     subfields of solid state chemistry and surface science.  There are              two major thrusts in this experimental program.  The first                      focusses on the synthesis and characterization of low-dimensional               inorganic materials.  Of particular interest to this research is                the development of an understanding of how the electrical,                      optical, and magnetic properties of these materials are controlled              by factors such as metal-metal coupling and solid state structure,              as well as how these factors can be manipulated synthetically.                  The second research thrust centers on the use of scanning                       tunneling microscopy for the in situ study of surface adsorbates.               Initial studies will focus on the structure and bonding of                      transition metal catalysts on metallic supports and the                         structures of important biological molecules adsorbed on metal                  surfaces.                                                                                                                                                       The research activities that are enabled by this Presidential                   Young Investigator Award could give rise to the discovery of                    strategies for the design and preparation of materials with                     predictable electrical, optical, and magnetic properties.                       Additionally, these studies should yield insights into the                      dynamics of interfacial processes that are of importance to                     catalysis and bioprocesses.",
