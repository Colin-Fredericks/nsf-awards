 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the best methods for studying the underlying mechanisms                  associated with the properties of a material is to make                         measurements of the temperature dependence of intrinsic                         properties of the material.  This fact has been brought home                    forcefully in reviewing the work currently in progress on the new               high Tc superconductors.  Despite the importance of understanding               the significance of such measurements and the techniques involved               in making them, many students have had very little opportunity                  for laboratory exposure in this area.  In this project two                      systems for the measurement of temperature dependent properties                 will be developed for use in the upper and lower level student                  laboratories.  The systems will include two Hansen High-Tran                    Liquid Transfer Systems, for sample cooling and temperature                     control, and two Hewlett Packard 150 series personal computer                   systems for data acquisition and real-time analysis.  The new                   equipment will be used in the sophomore-level modern physics                    laboratory to make measurements of transport properties that can                be explained in terms of a simple free-electron model, in the                   senior-level advanced laboratory to investigate the properties of               superconductors, quasi-low dimensional conductors and other novel               materials, and also in individual student research projects.",
