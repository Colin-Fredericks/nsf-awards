 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will help to support two workshops, one on composite                 materials and another on advanced ceramic materials, to be held in              conjunction with the Ninth Inter-American Conference on Materials               Technology in Santiago, Chile.  The workshops will focus on new                 research developments in these fields with particular emphasis on               applied research activities that are appropriate to the Latin American          setting, including the utilization of locally produced materials as             constituents of advanced composites and ceramic materials.  The                 workshops will also address the need for appropriate curricula that             would enable more Latin American countries to produce research and              engineering personnel qualified to work in these areas.                                                                                                         This Ninth Inter-American Conference on Materials Technology is the             latest in a series of conferences which began in San Antonio, Texas in          1968, as a mechanism for bringing together representatives of the               Inter-American materials research and applications communities to               establish a dialogue ranging from exchange of state-of-the-art research         to field applications of technology.  In each of these conferences,             there has been substantial involvement from Latin American sources as           well as strong participation from the United States, Canada, and to a           limited extent, from other nations outside the Western Hemisphere.  The         workshop organizer, Dr. Russell Drew of Science and Technology                  Consultants in Virginia, and the Organization of American States, which         is contributing major support to the conference, have assembled a               distinguished group of scientists from academia, industry, and                  government to participate in the conferences.  This grant will                  partially support the participation of seven U.S. scientists and seven          Latin American scientists in the two workshops and by so doing fulfills         the objectives of the Science in Developing Countries Program to                promote meetings and communication between scientists from the                  developing and developed world.***",
