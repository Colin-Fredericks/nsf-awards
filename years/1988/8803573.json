 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research visits between                   researchers at the U.S. National Institutes of Health under the                 direction of Dr. John Rinzel and researchers at the Universidad                 Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) under the leadership of Dr.                  Humberto Carrillo.  For over 30 years, mathematical models have been            formulated and used to describe and interpret the electrical                    activity (action potentials) of various nerve, muscle, and secretory            cells.  However, long-time behavior often involves dynamics on two              different time scales, e.g., action potentials (time scale of msec)             and variation of second messengers such as intracellular calcium                (tens of seconds).  The researchers intend to study such behavior               using models that include the short-time averaged influence of                  action potentials but not the detailed time courses of individual               events.  As a model problem, they will consider the phenomenon of               bursting electrical oscillations.                                                                                                                               The approach will involve both numerical and analytical methods and,            in particular, the mathematical technique of averaging.  They will              derive and analyze biophysically detailed, \"averaged\" differential              equations for the slow dynamics of bursting.  The formulation and               study of an idealized, analytically tractable model with important              generic properties will be useful in elucidating the qualitative                character of all such models.  The work will proceed simultaneously             at both institutions with extensive computations done in Bethesda               and rigorous justification of averaging in Mexico City.  The                    approach will allow a biophysical description and interpretation.               Furthermore, it will provide insight into the important role played             by slow variables as well as into new and interesting mathematical              questions related to the method of averaging.",
