 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program                  supports research of Dr. G. Barney Ellison, University of                       Colorado, to study the infrared absorption spectroscopy of                      jet-cooled organic radicals.  The reactions of radicals with                    ions will also be studied in a fast flow reactor.  Radicals are                 unstable reactive intermediates which are of paramount                          importance in many combustion processes and high temperature                    plasmas; spectroscopic probes are needed to monitor the fate of                 these metastable species.                                                                                                                                       The enterprise is to develop an experiment which will enable                    preparation of intense radical beams via a free jet expansion.                  Radicals such as methyl, allyl, and cyanomethyl will be                         prepared by a variety of photochemical and thermal sources.                     Sources will be monitored by a photoionization mass                             spectrometer.  Radical densities on the order of 1 mTorr will                   be prepared and these reactive species will be cooled by the                    jet to rotational temperatures of about 20 K.  These radicals                   will be investigated by infrared absorption spectroscopy with                   an FTIR. Selected for study are the family of methyl radicals:                  methyl, fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, and                      cyanomethyl. In all cases, it is planned to establish the                       molecular geometries and vibrational frequencies.  The allyl                    radical is of similar interest since it is the simplest                         conjugated hydrocarbon.                                                                                                                                         Clean, characterized radical beams will be used to study the                    reactions between negative ions, such as hydroxide ion or                       methoxide ion, and hydrocarbon radicals such as allyl or                        benzyl.  Dr. Ellison hopes to establish the gas phase acidity                   of allyl to contrast with propene or toluene.                                                                                                                   Separate experiments will use these radical sources to study                    the scattering of methyl radicals off clean gold or graphite                    surfaces.  This will establish the sticking coefficients of                     these radicals as well as the rate of molecular deposition.",
