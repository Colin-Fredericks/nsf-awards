 "awd_abstract_narration": "In every area of large-scale computing, solutions to a range                    of vitally important problems currently take too long, or                       cost too much, or are completely unattainable because of the                    limitations inherent in even the most sophisticated of                          today's serial or vector processing computers.  As we reach                     the fundamental limits of hardware technology, any                              substantial increase in computational speed (and                                capabilities) must come from some form of parallel                              architecture.  At present, however, the usefulness of these                     systems is severly limited by the lack of proper high-level                     parallel programming environments, and by the lack of                           knowledge of appropriate parallel programming techniques.                                                                                                       Scientific Computing Associates is developing a parallel                        programming system based on Linda, a set of parallel process                    management operations that can be inserted into an existing                     serial programming language such as C or Fortran, and provide                   convenient access to parallelism from within a familiar high-                   level language.  During Phase II they propose to extend and                     improve the performance of the C-Linda compiler, improve the                    user-interface aspects of the Linda programming environment,                    build Linda run-time systems for the Cray X/MP multiprocessor                   supercomputer and produce a marketable product for shared                       memory parallel architectures based on the Linda system.                                                                                                        I recommend funding this proposal to the amount requested,                      and if possible, making the award in two increments to assure                   the viability of the project as suggested by one of the                         reviewers; the second half being contingent upon satisfactory                   demonstration of the ultimate product to be marketed.",
