 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves studying the environment and nature                 of the high luminosity galaxies discovered by the IRAS satellite.               One possible cause for the large amounts of energy emitted may be               that the galaxy has undergone an interaction or a merger with                   another galaxy.  If this is correct one would expect to find that               these active galaxies occur preferentially in galaxy clusters                   where the space density of galaxies is larger and the probability               of collision higher.  The surrounding environment of the galaxies               will be studied using the Palomar survey plates and CCD images                  acquired with the Mt. Lemmon telescope.  The CCD images                         themselves will provide a resource for study of the type of                     activity present, which may be due to a huge excess of star                     formation, or to an active nuclear region, or possibly to both.                      This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1)                 to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                  engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF                  and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and                     engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists                and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic                    institutions.  By encouraging the participation of women in                     science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future                     scientific vitality.",
