 "awd_abstract_narration": "The U.S.-Japan Coordinated Program from Masonry Building Research               is the third in a series of joint structural research projects                  done under the auspices of the Panel on Wind and Seismic Effects                on UJNR.  Research in the U.S. began in the mid-fall of 1985 and                is progressing well.  The Japanese research began approximately                 18 months earlier and is also in good order.                                                                                                                    Joint meetings are held every year, alternating between                         countries, for the purpose of exchanging ideas and information to               the benefit of both countries.  This project would support                      attendance of nine U.S. researchers at the next meeting in Japan.               In addition, there will be opportunities for the U.S. delegation                to witness Japanese masonry construction, masonry unit                          manufacture and the set-up of the full-scale test of a five-story               masonry building.",
