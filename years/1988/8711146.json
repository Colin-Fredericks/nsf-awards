 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Australian-Antarctic Discordance is a unique and                    enigmatic bathymetric and geologic  feature of the mid-oceanic                  ridge system whose origin is poorly understood. The present award               will support an integrated geophysical and geochemical project to               study the Discordance  zone. The combination of a comprehensive                 geochemical investigation with a SeaMARC II side-scan sonar                     survey and detailed magnetic and gravity analyses will provide a                unique data set which will focus on two problems which are of                   fundamental significance, both on a global scale and with respect               to the nature of the Discordance itself: (1) the geophysical and                geochemical nature of the eastern boundary of the Discordance                   which is one of the most pronounced geochemical and bathymetric                 discontinuities in the global mid-ocean ridge system and (2) the                interrelationships among axial depth, axial morphology, ridge                   segmentation, and along axis petrologic variations, all of which                are unusually variable within and outside the Discordance.                              The study is a cooperative project between scientists at                Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory, Massachusetts Institute of               Technology, and the University of Hawaii. Field work will be done               from the R.V. Moana Wave.",
