 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is on characterizing the key intermediates in the                 functioning of juvenile hormones (JH) in insect development and                 will be supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry                   Program.  This research will lead to the elucidation of JH                      action which will provide insights into alternative methods of                  insect control.                                                                                                                                                 Unknown endogenous juvenoids and anti-juvenoids in insects will                 be isolated and characterized by the use of receptor binding                    assays to guide fractionation, purification, and authenication.                 These invertebrate compounds may be morphogens or                               anti-morphogens involved in receptor protein-mediated                           transcription of chromosomal DNA.                                                                                                                               1.  Endogenous Juvenoids.  Juvenile hormone (JH) action can be                  mimicked in vivo by over five thousand synthetic juvenoids,                     many unrelated to JH itself. Tritium and I-125 labeled JH                       mimics developed at SUNY, Stony Brook were used to discover the                 existence of unique juvenoid binding sites in target cell                       nuclei of the tobacco hornworm.  These sites do not recognize                   JH homologs.  Thus it is predicted that endogenous small                        molecules are present in immature insects which are natural                     ligands for these juvenoid receptors.  Using the binding of                     tritium-methoprene or tritium-S-31183 (or their photolabile                     analogs), the competitive binding materials will be purified                    from early instar Manduca (tobacco hornworm) larvae to                          establish the existence and structure of these natural                          morphogens.                                                                                                                                                     2.  Inhibitors of Termite Caste Differentiation.  Soldier                       termites produce abundant defense secretions in their head; in                  addition, it has now been found that other substances are                       present, which can inhibit the methoprene-induced molting of                    workers into presoldiers.  Termite workers and larvae of the                    Eastern subterranean termite Reticulitermes flavipes are an                     abundant resource for isolation of methoprene receptor involved                 in stimulating caste differentiation, while soldiers and nymphs                 contain inhibitory pheromones which block this action of                        methoprene in vivo.  An in vitro biochemical assay has been                     developed by which changes in hemolymph JH binding proteins                     induced by methoprene are detected by photoaffinity labeling.",
