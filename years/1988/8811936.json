 "awd_abstract_narration": "This expedited award for novel research is to investigate the use of            three-dimensional computer modeling on construction sites.  The                 project is to conduct fundamental research in the use of three-                 dimensional modeling as a means of communication and construction               process simulation.  It will test the differences in constructability           reviews, quality of design, construction schedules, construction                planning, and construction progress reporting when accomplished using           a three-dimensional model versus traditional two-dimensional models.            In addition, it will investigate techniques for using three-                    dimensional models to instruct and train construction supervisors on            site to improve productivity as a consequence of the learning curve             effect.                                                                         The research program is novel, in that it combines the research                 strengths of the University with the best available computer                    technology of the construction industry in an intimate working                  relationship.  This form of collaborative research is unique, but               should become the standard approach for future work in computer-                integrated construction.                                                        The research program is timely, in that the Columbia Center for                 Engineering and Physical Science Research provides a unique                     experimental laboratory for collaboration between University                    researchers and design and construction firms in the Metropolitan               area.  The Center is currently under design and will commence                   construction in 1988.                                                           Finally, the research program is not merely a general academic                  study of computer technology but rather identifies scientific                   hypotheses that can be experimentally verified or refuted.  This                proposal covers the detailed design of the experiments for                      empirical confirmation during the construction of the actual                    project.  The results of the study will provide definitive                      conclusions that can be immediately applied to advance the                      technology and productivity of the U.S. construction industry.",
