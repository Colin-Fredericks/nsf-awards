 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies on the origin and development of continental                rifts have clearly been hampered by our lack of knowledge on the                deep structure of the East African Rift.  This classic rift is the              standard by which all others are measured.  This grant is one of                five collaborative grants which support U.S. participation in an                international effort to conduct a cooperative study of the Kenyan               portion of this rift.  Major funding is being provided by the                   Federal Republic of Germany and the European Economic Community,                with additional participation by France, Holland, Spain and                     Ireland, as well as Kenya.  The U.S. Geological Survey also has a               major role, and will provide a large number of field instruments.               A preliminary experiment was completed in 1985.  The results of                 this experiment suggest that the deep structure of the Kenya Rift               is different than anticipated and that the major phase of the                   project is both scientifically valid and logistically feasible.                 The major seismic experiment is aimed at determining lithospheric               structure in the rift and in adjacent areas.  Structure of the                  sub-Moho lithosphere along the rift, detailed structure in the                  axial area of the rift, and the transition zones between the rift               and adjacent areas are the prime areas of emphasis.",
