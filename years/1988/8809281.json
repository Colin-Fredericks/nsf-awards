 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapidly increasing immigration into the United States has spawned much          public debate and also legislation to regulate the inflow.  This                phenomenon has also stimulated a growing literature on the economics of         immigration which has focused on trying to better understand the causes         and consequences immigration.  The purpose of this research is to               extend and deepen our understanding of immigration in two directions.           One part of the study will examine the economic success of immigrants           over an extended period from 1940 through 1980.  The other part will            extend a theoretical model of migration to account for return                   migration.                                                                      The first part of the study will involve jointly analyzing the                  performance of immigrants in the U.S. labor market in the five Census           from 1940 through 1980.  This approach allows for a clearer                     interpretation of the role played by the 1965 Amendments to the                 Immigration and Nationality Act, as well as avoids some of the biases           that have affected other studies.  The second part will generalize an           economic model of immigration to allow for the possibility that                 incoming migrants change their minds, and thus return migration flows           are generated.  This model will be tested using the Census Public Use           Files, published Immigration and Naturalization Service data, and the           Aliens Legally Admitted for Permanent Residence micro data.",
