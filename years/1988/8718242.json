 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will investigate basic mechanisms underlying                    cellular and subcellular responses of pituitary cells to                        corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and specific modulators of                CRH action.  It is focused on anterior lobe corticotropes and                   will study CRH binding and internalization (with quantitative                   electron microscopic cytochemical analyses) and hormone storage                 (with immunocytochemistry).  The study will determine if                        inhibitors (glucocorticoids) or potentiators (vasopressin) of                   ACTH release alter the rate or route of CRH processing by                       corticotropes.  The reserve cell population that is activated to                bind CRH in the presence of the potentiator, vasopressin, will be               identified.   The study will test the hypothesis that                           potentiation of CRH action is dependent upon the activation of                  unique vasopressin sensitive cells that have the potential to                   produce ACTH.  Another hypothesis that will be tested is that                   glucocorticoid inhibition of CRH action, in its early stages,                   includes either a block in the transport of CRH receptors to the                plasma membrane or a rerouting of CRH-receptor complexes to                     lysosomes for rapid degradation.  Changes in CRH binding will be                identified with a biotinylated CRH ligand and labelled avidin                   stains.  All cytochemical stains will be analyzed with the                      Bioquant System IV and image analysis system.                                        The results of this research will enhance the understanding                of basic mechanisms regulating the release of hormone by one type               of pituitary cell, the corticotrope.",
