 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will partially support a symposium jointly organized by              Prof. John Kardos of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri and           Prof. L. Nicolais of the University of Naples, Italy on the topic of            processing of polymeric matrix composite materials.  In recent years,           the use of composite materials has expanded from aerospace                      applications to consumer product industries.  Many consumer products            must be produced in large volume and at relatively low unit cost, not           to mention the fact that aerospace manufacturers are also sensitive             to the leverage that low unit cost has on expanded applications.  Low           unit costs in turn are associated with short production cycle times             and high production yields.  In this context, management of the                 curing, forming, and shaping processes for composite materials                  represents as significant a change to the materials and manufacturing           organizations as the impact the technology has had on the design                development functions.                                                                                                                                          This symposium, jointly supported by the National Science Foundation            (NSF) and the Italian National Research Council (CNR), will bring               together leading researchers from both industry and academia to                 discuss advances and current problems in the processing of these                materials, thus helping to address manufacturing process operations             in both the consumer product industries and in those industries in              which composite materials are utilized in high performance primary              structural applications.  Because of current worldwide interest in              composite materials, this symposium is both timely and of potential             benefit to the U.S. and Italy and, furthermore, should increase                 collaborative interactions between U.S. and Italian researchers.",
