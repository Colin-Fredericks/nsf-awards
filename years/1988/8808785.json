 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Opportunities for Women Research Planning Grant is                in the general area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry and in the              subfields of chromatography and mass spectrometry.  During the                  twelve month period beginning 1 July 1988, Professor Dietrich will              draw upon her considerable expertise in both chromatography and                 mass spectrometry to develop new skills in hybrid liquid                        chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) techniques which she will              apply to the study of various environmental problems, particularly              those relating to hazardous waste management.  The planned skill                development activities include both independent work and also                   collaborative research at the National Institute for Environmental              Health Science.  These activities should contribute to Professor                Dietrich's establishing a competitive independent research program              in her laboratory at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State                   University during the tenure of this Research Planning Grant                    award.                                                                                                                                                          The research area that will be explored in this project, namely                 the development and application of LC/MS techniques for the                     analysis of multicomponent environmental samples, is broadly                    important to both basic science and public health.  The results of              this work could impact significantly on the fields of                           environmental chemistry and mass spectrometry, as well as upon the              health sciences; it could lead to the identification of new                     technology that is necessary for the disposal and treatment of                  hazardous waste.",
