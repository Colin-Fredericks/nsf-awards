The purpose of this research         is to begin initial development of new analytical tools which will be           used to determine the range of technologies coexisting in each of the           four-digit U.S. manufacturing industries and the effect on production           costs as lower cost technologies replace more costly ones.  The                 differences in costs associated with each of the technologies in                an industry, and the sensitivity of each to changes in input prices,            along with other information developed in the study will be useful per          se and in predicting the pace at which investment will be undertaken in         each industry.  The effect of such investment on U.S. and foreign               markets will also be evaluated.  To accomplish these ends, the research         will result in a set of microeconomic tools applicable at the                   individual industry level.",
