 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research on                                     proteoglycan sulfotransferases between Dr. Carlos                               Hirschberg of the University of Massachusetts Medical                           School in Worcester and Dr. Enrique Brandan of the                              Catholic University in Santiago, Chile.  The effect of                          these enzymes on the sulfation of proteoglycans is                              important because biological processes such as blood                            clotting and cell growth depend on these sulfated                               protein-carbohydrate complexes.  Antibodies will be                             obtained against the sulfotranferase enzyme, key to                             the sulfation of proteoglycans and the substrate                                specificity will be determined for the enzymes.  These                          studies will lead to an understanding of the                                    biosynthesis of the proteoglycans through the                                   regulation of the sulfation reaction.                                                                                                                           Dr. Brandan has already purified N-heparan sulfate                              sulfotransferase in Massachusetts and now will purify                           O-heparan sulfate sulfotranferase from rat liver in                             Chile. The antibodies will be prepared in Dr.                                   Hirschberg's laboratory while the immunohistochemistry                          will be done by Dr. Jurgen Roth of the Biocenter in                             Basel, Switzerland which adds a multilateral aspect to                          this work. Both principal investigators have good                               track records and have worked together successfully so                          both laboratories will benefit from the collaboration.                          Dr. Hirschberg will gain Dr. Brandan's extensive                                experience in enzyme purification and Dr. Brandan will                          benefit from the use of the facilities at the                                   University of Massachusetts and will strengthen his                             new research program in Chile.  This is a good example                          of the benefits of international cooperation in                                 science. By providing partial support for Dr. Brandan                           while in the U.S., this award will help fulfill the                             objectives of the Science in Developing Countries                               Program providing benefits to the U.S. as well as to                            the Chilean collaborator.",
