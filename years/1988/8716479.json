To produce a physical map using these endonucleases as tools, a                 transposon derivative from Tn917 with a Not I (GCGGCCGC) site                   will be constructed and transposed into the genome.  Since there                are no sites for Not I in the S. aureus genome this introduced                  site will be unique.  It will act as a zero point for the rapid                 production of an accurate physical map of Sma I, Sac II and Bgl I               sites by indirect end-labeling of DNA separated by pulsed field                 gel electrophoresis.  Subchromosomal libraries will be                          constructed from restriction fragments separated by PFGE.  These                will be arrayed to produce ordered chromosomal libraries.  The                  physical map will be correlated to the genetic map by probing the               plasmid arrays with cloned genes.  Differences in the physical                  order of DNA between species will be compared by hybridizing                    individual members of a chromosomal library array from one                      species to all members of an array from the other species.",
