 "awd_abstract_narration": "Political institutions in African societies are changing as                a result of decolonization, social pressures, environmental                     problems, and changes in world-wide economic systems.  Many                     groups are reviving political structures that were extant before                European colonialization and modifying them to meet contemporary                needs.                                                                               In this project, the researcher will study the social and                  cultural dimensions of the Mpezeni Ngoni's (eastern Zambia)                     political transformations.  This society is reinstituting a                     monarchy and its accompanying rituals which had been suppressed                 during the colonial era.  The researcher will discover how power                and authority are being expressed in this new situation by                      focusing on the monarchy's place within the Zambian state system                and its effect on agriculturalists.  He will help explain the                   seemingly contradictory processes of nationalism and ethnic                     tribalism that are affecting the political structure of the                     country.",
