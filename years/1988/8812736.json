 "awd_abstract_narration": "The generalized assignment problem (GAP) is a specially structured              integer programming problem.  Typical applications include facility             location, personnel assignment, logistics and computer networking.  A           totally automated software package designed for solving large-scale GAP         and related problems will be available for both experimental purposes           and production applications.                                                                                                                                    The resultant software will be a linear programming based system which          incorporates a polyhedral cutting plane philosophy.  This approach,             which is particularly geared toward the solution of large-scale                 problems, is based upon the structural properties of the polytope               associated with GAP.  In general, current solution methods for GAP              ignore the structure of the polytope; consequently, these methods tend          to be appropriate only for problems of moderate size since                      computational requirements tend to increase very rapidly as problem             size increases.                                                                                                                                                 The foundation for the system will depend upon constraint                       identification algorithms developed for three classes of facet defining         inequalities which have been derived for GAP.  These facet defining             inequalities represent a significant extension within this area of              integer programming since they are based upon combinations of knapsack          constraints.  On the other hand, currently available integer                    programming systems, which employ a polyhedral philosophy, have only            considered the information embedded within individual knapsack                  constraints when generating inequalities.",
