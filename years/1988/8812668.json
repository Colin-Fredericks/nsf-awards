 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since the end of World War II, nations throughout the world have           experienced increasing rates of internal migration, as people from              less productive areas have relocated to areas with more cultivatable            land in order to raise their standards of living.  Some of this                 relocation has been spontaneous, but in many nations, \"frontier                 migration\" has been encouraged by national governmental policies.               Research on resettlement from one rural area to another has focused on          the costs and benefits of these policies, but little attention has been         given to the impacts of migration on the ultimate disposition of the            migrants themselves.  Have migrants succeeded in acquiring land?  How           have they adapted to the new social, economic, and environmental                settings in which they reside?  This project will address these                 questions by developing a theoretical framework for assessing the               impacts of frontier migration on migrants and by refining that theory           through field research in Nepal on migration from the central hill              regions to the Terai plains in the south.  The project will combine             qualitative and quantitative research methodologies in order to develop         better understandings of the processes and outcomes of resettlement on          migrants.  Information will be gathered through traditional means of            participant observation, oral history, and informal discussion with             migrants and state officials and through collection of standardized             data in interviews with more than 350 migrants.  Those data will                provide the basis for analysis by simultaneous solution of a set of             equations assessing the relationship between different social,                  economic, demographic, and geographic variables.  Refinements of the            theoretical framework based on Nepalese field work will permit its use          in other developing nations where frontier migration is occurring.                   The benefits of this research project will be threefold.  At the           theoretical level, it will develop a new framework for assessing how            rural-to-rural migration affects the migrants themselves.  At the               empirical level, it will provide useful information on the way in which         frontier migration has altered the ways of life of Nepalese who have            resettled in the Terai region, and data collected in this project will          be available to other scholars examining a variety of issues in this            and similar locales.  The research will also be beneficial to policy-           makers, as it will provide a more comprehensive means of assessing the          efficacy of various regional development policies and of determining            the ways in which those policies affect the residential locations,              economic activities, and agricultural practices of migrants.",
