 "awd_abstract_narration": "Historians have long argued that science and technology, as                human pursuits, must be inextricably intertwined with the culture               and society in which they are created.  Preferences for certain                 kinds of explanations, choices of research problems, the manner                 of presentation of results, etc. all are affected by factors                    which are said to be external to the actual content of the                      science or technology.  That these factors have an impact can be                seen in the different national styles in science.  The paradigm                 case is the differences which are immediately apparent between                  British and French physics:  the former being exceptionally                     empirical and prone to use mechanical models, the latter being                  extraordinarily formal and abstract.                                                                                                                                 While the impact of external factors on science has long                   been asserted, we have had too few detailed case studies of how                 they affect the directions of science.  Dr. Goldstein, under this               grant, will examine the development of three different schools of               psychology in France of the 19th century and the role of                        politics, social organization and public support in influencing                 the success of one of these schools.  This study promises to                    greatly enhance our understanding of how science, especially                    social science, is shaped by the society in which it is                         developed.                                                                                                                                                           Dr. Goldstein's study will address the implications of the                 French Revolution on the development of a science of psychology                 by exploring the three psychological models that competed in                    France during the period 1790-1850:  sensationalism, rational                   spiritualism or eclecticism, and phrenology.  Her study will                    consider the political affiliations of their adherents, their                   varying degrees of success at institutionalizing their theories                 in the new state educational system, and their efforts at popular               dissemination through informal channels.  Arguing that each model               furnished contemporaries with a distinctive and widely used                     language of mental states, Dr. Goldstein will seek to explain why               eclecticism -- the least scientific of the three -- won an                      enduring victory over its contemporaries.  Finally, the study                   will probe a little known debate over the unity or multiplicity                 of the self, a debate reflecting the porousness of 19th century                 psychological theory to such basic cultural issues a the attitude               toward secularization and the conflict between liberalism and                   socialism.",
