 "awd_abstract_narration": "The struck employer faces a choice between halting operations or                continuing operations by subcontracting the bargaining units' work,             assigning the striking employees' work to other employees, hiring               replacements for the striking workers, or some combination of these             three strategies.  Although there is a considerable body of research            investigating the causes and consequences of economic strikes, there            has been little empirical research examining either the determinants or         the consequences of the firm's decision to operate during strikes.              Dr. Gramm plans to explore the feasibility of conducting a project to           analyze the determinants of the struck employer's choice to operate             during a strike and to evaluate the consequences of the choice.  Her            study includes the development of theoretical and econometric                   frameworks within which to examine the reactions of company management          to economic strikes and the effects of choices such as subcontracting,          closing down, hiring new workers, and reassigning work.  Also, a pilot          study of 100 strikes is planned involving content analyses of archival          data sources and the administration of questionnaires.  Finally, the            preparation of a proposal for a larger scale study is contemplated.                                                                                             It is timely to prepare a plan to conduct empirical research on the             determinants and consequences of the firm's decision to operate during          strikes because there has recently been an increase in management's             exercise of its right to operate during strikes, and new strike                 strategies have been developed.  The project has potential to                   illuminate our understanding of the interaction between labor and               management in a dispute situation and also of enhancing our knowledge           more generally of bargaining behavior.",
