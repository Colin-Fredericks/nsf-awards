 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recognizing the potential of better design principles to                   improve the manufacturability and market responsiveness of                      designed products, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has                    made this subject the focus of its research program in                          engineering  design theory and methodology.  The National                       Research Council, through its Manufacturing Studies Board,                      proposes to establish a Committee on Engineering Design Theory                  and Methodology to provide advice regarding the future directions               of this program.                                                                       The committee will study engineering design in the United                States, focusing on the role of design in U.S. economic,                        education, manufacturing, and research support systems.  Within                 this study, the committee will: (a) outline a long-range                        national strategy for graduate and undergraduate education in                   engineering design, including suggestions for balancing the                     current academic emphasis on analytical science with practical                  design synthesis, implementing change despite the high cost of                  engineering design education, and attracting and educating                      qualified engineering design faculty despite the current                        shortage, and (b) outline a strategy for conducting research                    necessary to develop a fundamental theory of engineering                        design, including identifying the basic and applied research                    topics that need to be addressed and suggesting which of those                  topics are appropriate for federal funding or consortia of                      industry and academia.",
