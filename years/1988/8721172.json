 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are two main thrusts to the research.  The first is to               support collaboration between the Principal Investigator and                    Professor Claude Allegre, University of Paris, on the                           interpretation of isotopic and other geochemical data in terms of               mantle convection and related processes.  The object is to                      understand how mantle dynamics leads to the geochemical signatures              of mid ocean ridge basalt, ocean island basalts, island arc                     volcanism, and continental volcanism.  Important questions                      include:  Is mantle convection layered?  Is there significant                   recycling of continental crust into the mantle?  Is the layered,                subducted oceanic lithosphere remixed into the upper mantle                     reservoir?  The hypothesis that high-temperature peridotites are                examples of a \"marble-cake\" mantle will be studied with a                       combination field, laboratory, and theoretical studies.  A second               major thrust of the proposed research is to support collaboration               between the Principal Investigator and Professor David Spence,                  Imperial College, on the mechanics of magma fracture.  Magma                    fracture is a major mechanism for the transport of magma as well                as the origin of dikes and sills.  It is also the mechanism                     responsible for maars and kimberlite eruptions.  Buoyancy driven                magma fractures will be studied as will the thermal aspects of                  magma migration in propagating fractures.",
