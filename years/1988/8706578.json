The floristic area of the West Indies, especially the                islands of the Lesser Antilles was one of the first visited by                  18th century European explorers.  Existing floras or plant-lists                for the area are nationally oriented for the Dutch, Danish,                     British, and French island groups.  The present flora will                      incorporate all botanical records, including those of cultivated                plants, and represents the first comprehensive inventory of the                 botanical resources of the area.  Archival studies in Europe have               revealed the sources and dates of introduction of many of the                   exotic, but not necessarily cultivated, species of the flora.                           The Flora of the Lesser Antilles includes descriptions of               plant families, genera, and species, with identification keys for               practical use; data on synonymy of scientific names in the old                  literature; references to taxonomic monographs; general                         distributions of taxa geographically; ecological data; and common               names.  Data on the status of rare or endangered plants are                     included.  Each genus is illustrated with original art work of a                representative species not previously illustrated in the                        scientific literature.",
