 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, the principal investigator will study the                transition of the continental rifting to seafloor spreading in                  the Northern Red Sea.  In an earlier grant, the PI studied the                  early rifting of the continental margins of the Northern Red                    Sea and acquired a large amount of geophysical data in the area.                In this study, the PI proposes to integrate underway                            geophysical data from Exxon and ESP data from his French                        colleagues to his existing data base.  The available Exxon                      data set is quite extensive, consisting of closely spaced                       multichannel seismic reflection profiles and gravity, magnetic                  and bathymetric data.  The two ship ESP data collected by the                   French are also of good quality and indicate possible arrivals                  from the Moho.                                                                          The interpretation of this increased data set will lead to              the understanding of the mechanism of extension in space and                    time from the rift region to the sea floor spreading region in                  the Northern Red Sea and the conditions under which such a                      transition takes place.  The theme of the research is of                        fundamental importance in plate tectonics.                                              The structural and tectonic information gained from this                project can also be used as constraints in thermal and                          mechanical modeling of the extension of lithosphere which leads                 to rifting.",
