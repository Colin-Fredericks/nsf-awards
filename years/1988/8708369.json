 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Wayne J. Elisens of the University of Oklahoma will                 conduct a multidisciplinary study designed to assess taxonomic                  relationships and evolutionary mechanisms in a group of long-                   lived desert perennials.  Shrub snapdragons (the genus Galvezia)                occur in desert habitats in continental North America, the                      California Islands, coastal South America, and the Galapagos                    Islands.  Because of their biological characteristics and                       geographic distributional pattern, shrub snapdragons represent an               ideal group for investigation of the processes and patterns of                  evolutionary change in plants that occur in a) islands and                      continents, b) an oceanic archipelago and a group of offshore                   islands, and c) desert biomes on two continents.                                        Research methodologies include field study of and                       collections from natural populations, investigations of                         reproductive system and crossing among species propagated in                    greenhouses, laboratory studies of chromosomal and genetic                      divergence, and numerical estimates of genetic and phylogenetic                 relatedness.  The major goals of the study are to elucidate                     evolutionary mechanisms among New World desert shrubs, quantify                 genetic differentiation among the species, reconstruct the                      evolutionary history of the shrub snapdragons, and propose a                    formal classification.  This study is particularly significant                  because evolutionary mechanisms among desert woody plants are                   poorly understood and because floras of islands provide some of                 the best examples of natural experiments for examination of                     evolutionary divergence and processes associated with long-                     distance dispersal, establishment, and adaptation.  The results                 of this study are important for the conservation, management, and               utilization of desert woody plants in North and South America and               the Galapagos Islands.",
