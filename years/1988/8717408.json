 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this research are to investigate the potential                applications, data requirements, and symbology of automatic                     identification technology (AIT) in industrial construction site                 materials management (CSMM) and to derive a proposed set of standards           for their use.  The emphasis of the study will be on the data                   requirements, although other topics are needed to make the study a              complete systems analysis.  This systems formulation will be based on           demonstrated feasibility and preliminary testing of bar coding                  technology developed through in-house studies and studies sponsored             by industry users.  The tasks which would be executed are:                      1.  Study the Application Standards Developed by Other Industries:                  This includes primarily the Automotive Industry, Department of                  Defense, Health Industry, and Industry Bar-Code Alliance.                   2.  Continue Research on Uniform Materials Coding.  This research was               started in 1986  by  the Construction Industry Institute (CII)                  but was not completed.  To achieve Bar Code Standardization, a                  uniform manner for embedding information within data fields is                  needed.  The researchers will contact the respondents to work                   with them to discuss code content.                                          3.  Develop a Model for a Transfer Code.  Some bar proposed code                    structure is necessary to transfer information between suppliers,               contractors and owners.  For example, the manufacturer's                        identification should include a certain number of characters; the               buyers part number a certain number of characters; and the work                 package or system a certain number of characters.                           4.  Determine Data to be Encoded.  This will include the above, plus                data identifiers (e.g. quantity, weight, unit of measure,                       authorization, serial number, container code).                              5.  Develop a Proposed Set of Standards:  This could include Parts                  Identifiers, Equipment Tags, Shipping Labels, Purchase Orders,                  Warehouse Labels and Others.                                                It is assumed that the CII will provide a forum for exchange of                 ideas, companies to contact, and the first working group for                    negotiating and executing the proposed standard.  An Electronic Data            Task Force has been proposed for May 1988.  This new Task Force                 should assist in gaining overall CII support of this Standardization            effort.",
