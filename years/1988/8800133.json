 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lichens are symbiotic organisms composed of both an alga and            a fungus.  They dominate approximately 8% of terrestrial                        ecosystems and are important contributors to mineral cycling in                 many areas.  Also they are important biological indicators of                   pollution hazards such as sulfur dioxide.  Dr. Thomas Nash of                   Arizona State University is studying the species of lichens of                  the genus Xanthoparmelia in South America, in order to determine                reliable morphological and biochemical characters by which to                   recognize individual species and further to attempt to determine                the evolutionary affinities of these taxa.  Hundreds of novel                   chemical compounds (so called \"lichen substances\") have been                    identified in various lichens, and used at times as species                     markers.  Dr. Nash will test whether these chemical types are                   stable features of particular species or whether the chemistry                  varies with environmental conditions under which the lichens                    grow.  His taxonomic work on South American lichens will                        complement projects underway or completed on this genus for South               Africa, Australasia, and North America, covering ultimately                     nearly 400 species.",
