 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multi-institutional collaborations -- for instance, an experiment               run at a national laboratory by a team from a number of                         universities -- have become increasingly important to advances in               modern science and technology.  Despite the significance of these               transitory \"mini-institutions,\"  little is known about how to                   document them and meaningful records of such teams have not yet                 been secured for the use of historians, sociologists, and others                studying the research process.  This project is the first of a                  long term project being undertaken by the American Institute of                 Physics Center for History of Physics to study the complex                      issues facing the documentation of multi-institutional                          collaborations in physics and allied sciences.                                                                                                                  This study will identify patterns of collaboration, define the                  scope of the documentation problems, field-test possible                        solutions, and recommend future actions.  Adding to its own                     extensive experience, the Center staff will be joined in this                   work by archivists, historians of science and technology, and                   sociologists.   They will be advised by distinguished scientists,               administrators, and other specialists.  The focus of this initial               study is high-energy physics.                                                                                                                                   Future studies will be in the areas of space science and                        geophysics.  The long-range study will increasingly explore the                 applications of the project findings to other areas of science                  and technology and the development of policies and guidelines to                improve future documentation.",
