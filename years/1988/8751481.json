 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will be designed to educate participants to become aware of        how different teaching methods affect student understanding of selected         science concepts.  Building on teacher interest in doing classroom              research, the STAR model will bring teachers to a summer workshop where         they will become part of a classroom research team.  In order to study          how teaching methodology effects learning, the middle school teachers in        this project will need to acquire a deep understanding of the science           topics to be investigated, strategies for teaching for conceptual               change, and methods for determining levels of student understanding.            The first year's inservice and academic year follow up  will deal with          selected physics topics and the conceptual change teaching model.               During the second year, leaders from twenty-five school systems will            receive instruction so that they can conduct similar projects in their          own systems.  Years three and four will involve expanding the model to          the life and earth sciences.  During year five, a guide for developing          such inservice programs will be produced and disseminated.",
