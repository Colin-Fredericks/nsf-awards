 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies of intraseasonal, low frequency variability                 in midlatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere have strongly                        suggested that the probability density distributions of the                     planetary long waves (k = 2 to 4) are significantly bimodal.  In                contrast, the speed, horizontal and vertical shear of the zonal                 mean flow possess unimodal probability density distributions.                   The physical basis for such partitioning has not yet clear.  The                possibility that the bimodal structures are an artifact of data                 stratification method or numerical truncation during assimilation               has not yet been discounted either.  The present study addresses                these issues through further dignostic analyses of observational                data and numerical model simulations.  The Northern Hemisphere                  data would be examined to delineate the processes involved in                   transitions between the two modes for the planetary long waves                  and analysis extended to include the Southern Hemisphere data.                  Output from selected long integrations of a general circulation                 model simulations will be analysed to determine the probability                 density distribution functions of model planetary long waves.                   The possible influence of bimodality on the predictive skill of                 global numerical forecasts would be evaluated.  This work would                 contribute to our basic understanding of the dynamical process                  important in intraseasonal climate variability.",
