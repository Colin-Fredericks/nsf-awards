 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an experimental demonstration of a new homogeneous gas                  phase chemical reaction whose existence is predicted by kinetic                 modeling, a reaction in which methanol selectively reduces sulfur               trioxide to sulfur dioxide.  If, as predicted, this reaction                    occurs under conditions that would make its use practical in                    boilers and furnaces, it could be the basis of a new process that               would significantly improve the efficiency of heat recovery.  In                present practice, boilers and furnaces are operated with an                     intentional loss of efficiency in order to avoid corrosion                      problems due to sulfur trioxide.  A process for selective sulfur                trioxide reduction would also eliminate the ammonium disulfate                  fouling problems which presently hamper postcombustion reduction                with ammonia.                                                                                                                                                   Commercialization of a process for selectively reducing sulfur                  trioxide to sulfur dioxide will allow improved boiler and furnace               efficiencies and facilitate the use of post combustion nitrogen                 oxides control technologies.  The former would reduce America's                 dependence on imported oil while the latter would help solve the                acid rain problem.",
