 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Brad                 Finney, Humboldt State University and Dr. Bruce Beck, Imperial                  College of Science and Technology, University of London.                                                                                                        The investigators will carry out a joint study on the viability of              using operational control for river basin water quality management              with the Bedford Ouse river (U.K.) serving as a case study.  The                Bedford Ouse is the major river in one of the largest river basins              in England.  The river currently has a potentially serious nitrate              problem, with observed concentrations frequently exceeding the                  World Health Organization standard for potable water use.  This                 situation may be aggravated by the wastewater discharge from the                new city of Milton Keynes at the headwaters of the catchment.  A                dynamic river basin simulation model will be completed that                     includes influent to the treatment plant, treatment plant                       operation, nonpoint catchment runoff to the river, river water                  quality simulation and potable water treatment plant performance.               System identification and parameter estimation will be addressed                using recent advances in recursive time series algorithms.  The                 simulation model will be used to identify and examine operational               strategies for reducing the effect of the treatment plant on                    downstream water users.  The model will provide a practical                     working tool for improved management of the Bedford Ouse.  The                  study will produce improved methodologies for river water quality               basin management, will result in increased undrstanding of the use              of system identification procedures, and will examine how a river               basin institutional structure much different than that practiced                in the U. S. can encourage more efficient river water quality                   management.",
