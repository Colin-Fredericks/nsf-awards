 "awd_abstract_narration": "Long cycle-life rechargeable batteries exhibiting high energy                   densities have potential applications in space craft and other                  interplanetary vehicles, in equipments operating at above-ambient               environments such as oil wells, in electric vehicles, and for                   electrical load levelling.  High reliability, long cycle life and high          energy density are prime requirements of batteries for these uses.                                                                                              The PIs propose to design a moderate temperature rechargeable sodium            battery that fulfills some of the above needs.  They plan to evaluate           NaFeO2 and FeOCl as positive electrodes (cathodes) which are expected           to show an insertion or intercalation type positive electrode reaction          affording very long cycle life.  Other advantages of the proposed               system are:  (1) significantly less corrosion problems than that                encountered in the high temperature (>350oC) Na/S battery, (2) little           or no self-discharge because of the lower temperature operation and             the use of the solid electrolyte, and (3) improved energy efficiency            than that possible in the high temperature Na/molten S battery through          lower heat losses at the moderately high operating temperature of the           batteries.                                                                                                                                                      This company is well established and respected and the PI is a leader           in this field.  A Phase I SBIR grant is highly recommended.",
