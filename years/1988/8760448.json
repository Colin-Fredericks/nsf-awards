 "awd_abstract_narration": "Academic and industrial biotechnology researchers are continually               seeking better materials on which to culture cells.  The proposed               research will develop surfaces which will;                                                                                                                           1.  Improve the attachment and growth of anchorage dependent               cells        (e.g. epithelial cells), thus improving the                        efficiency of such     microcarrier cultures.                                        2.  Allow non-anchorage dependent cells (i.e. HeLa, CHO) to                grow      carrier-bound to facilitate separation of these cells                 and cell  culture products.                                                                                                                                     The PIs have used radio-frequency, non-equilibrium plasma                       reactions to chemically modify the surface of tissue culture                    plates, and found that their modifications cause significantly                  improved growth of a variety of cells in monolayer culture.  The                PIs proposed to test the hypothesis that they can perform an                    analogous modification on microcarrier beads and achieve the same               improvement in cell growth on these beads.  This would be a first               step toward development of a variety of surface modified tissue                 culture substrata which would support growth of cells otherwise                 impossible to grow in vitro, and which would improve the                        efficiency of large scale anchorage dependent cell culture.",
