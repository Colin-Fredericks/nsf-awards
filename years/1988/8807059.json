 "awd_abstract_narration": "Photodissociation is the major sink for aldehydes and                      ketones in the troposphere and is a primary source of free                      radicals which are important reactive intermediates in the                      chemistry of other atmospheric constituents including ozone and                 compounds that contribute to the formation of acid rain.  The                   competition between photodissociation and chemical reaction of                  aldehydes and ketones is an important factor controlling                        tropospheric free radical concentrations.  Uncertainty in the                   absorption cross sections, quantum yields for photodissociation,                and primary photolysis products for aliphatic aldehydes and                     ketones represents a significant source of error in models of                   tropospheric chemistry.                                                              The proposed research is a systematic study of the                         spectral and photochemical properties of aliphatic aldehydes                    and ketones.  The gas phase absorption spectra of these                         compounds in the wavelength region 200-400 nm will be measured                  in nitrogen/oxygen gas mixtures as a function of temperature to                 determine their absorption cross sections under conditions                      found in the troposphere.  Absorption spectra will also be                      measured in aqueous solution to determine the cross sections                    for these compounds in atmospheric droplets.  The primary                       quantum yields for gas phase and aqueous phase                                  photodissociation of several of the compounds will be                           determined as a function of photolysis wavelength, temperature,                 partial pressure of aldehyde or ketone and total pressure (for                  gas phase measurements), and pH and dissolved oxygen                            concentration (for aqueous phase measurements).  The results                    from the research will clarify the role of aliphatic aldehydes                  and ketones in the chemistry and photochemistry of the                          troposphere.",
