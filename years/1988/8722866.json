 "awd_abstract_narration": "Masonry construction comprises a large portion of building                      construction in the U.S. and the world.  Reinforced masonry                     construction use is increasing in moderate to higher seismic zones              because of its apparent features of economy, fire safety,                       architectural flexibility and ease of construction.  The present state          of masonry structural analysis and design, and materials and                    construction technologies does not enable an accurate prediction of             building behavior under lateral loads such as seismic loads.  In the            U.S., masonry buildings are designed and built with methods, codes and          standards that rely upon a mixture of working stress methods,                   empirical rules, and questionable methods for determining allowable             stress values.  Masonry is also a complex building material because of          the large number of design and construction variables which influence           the final product configuration and its response under seismic loads.           In order to describe the seismic response of masonry buildings it is            necessary to develop the fundamental knowledge base to determine basic          design methodologies consistent with safety and economic requirements.                                                                                          The research is an analytical effort to bridge the gap between                  experiments and analyses to provide a tool for the prediction of                seismic performance of masonry structures.  The project in particular           addresses correlation and analytical modelling of out-                          of-plane masonry walls excited by dynamic motions.  Various                     combinations of parameters from current out-of-plane experimental               programs will be considered for incorporation into analytical                   response models.  These models form an integral part of a                       wall/diaphragm interaction study and also overall structures                    models.  This project is part of the U.S.-Japan Coordinated                     Program for Masonry Building Research and the Technical                         Coordinating Committee for Masonry Research (TCCMAR) Program.",
