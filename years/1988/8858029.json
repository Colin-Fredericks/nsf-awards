 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigator's primary research interest is developing tools for           building large scale distributed systems.  This leads to work on                distributed algorithms and concurrent programming languages as well as          on programming environments.  Currently four research projects are              underway.                                                                                                                                                       MERCURY is a multiple-user language.based editor, where users may               simultaneously edit the same program, using the same machine or                 distributed across a network; current research focuses on developing            algorithms to support version and configuration control.  MELD, a               concurrent programming language, combines object-oriented and data flow         programming; current research involves adding transaction processing            facilities.  MARVEL is an architecture for knowledged-based engineering         environments that support controlled automation of computerized tools;          current work considers database support for long-lived transactions.            INFUSE is a 'city model' software development environment that enforces         cooperation of programmers via hierarchical integration of changes;             current research focuses on support for integration testing.",
