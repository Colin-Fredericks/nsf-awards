 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research will examine the preservation of the bone matrix protein           osteocalcin (referred to below as OC) in fossil bone and the possible           use of that protein for immunotaxonomy of fossil vertebrates.  This             research will constitute the major emphasis of this renewal period.  We         have found that OC is preserved in fossil bovine and rodent bone at             least 18-30 million years old.  This occurrence was confirmed both              immunologically and biochemically.  In addition, we have extracted              macromolecules from fossil horse bone (Miohippus, Oligocene (28 million         years old), South Dakota) and have elicited reaction with antibodies            raised against modern horse OC.  The discovery of preserved antigenic           determinants and potentially preserved proteins in such ancient                 materials opens the possibility for molecular paleontology studies of           phylogenetic relationships among major groups of extinct organisms,             something which is not possible with the usual molecular biological             methods applied to modern organisms (mitochondrial DNA restriction              enzyme site mapping, etc.)  This new research could be of major                 significance in understanding relationships among fossil vertebrates,           including extinct groups.  This research is unique in its direct study          of macromolecules extracted from fossils, rather than reconstructing            phylogenetic relationships from data on modern taxa.",
