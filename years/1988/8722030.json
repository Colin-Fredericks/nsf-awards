 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Wojciech Pulawski of the California Academy of Sciences             proposes to continue his career-long study of the sphecid wasps.                The genus Gastrosericus occurs across tropical Asia and Africa                  but has never been thoroughly studied using a consistent and                    modern approach.  The habitat occupied by these wasps is                        continually diminishing, and careful study must be accomplished                 before they are extinct.  Dr. Pulawski proposes to collect new                  representative samples of the genus in Thailand, Pakistan, and                  Africa, to describe their morphology, behavior, and ecological                  habits, and to use these data to reconstruct their evolutionary                 and biogeographic history.                                                              The proposed work has implications beyond the confines of a             single genus of wasp.  Dr. Pulawski is amassing a unique data                   resource, from which he will eventually be able to distill the                  evolutionary pattern of an important and widespread tropical                    group.  This history can then be compared to evolutionary and                   biogeographic histories of other groups (both wasp and non-wasp),               in order to test hypotheses of causal processes.",
