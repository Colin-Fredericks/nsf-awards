 "awd_abstract_narration": "Genetic interactions between plants and their fungal                    pathogens have been studied for many of the major disease                       problems in agriculture, but little is known about host                         resistance and pathogen virulence in natural systems.  Since it                 is widely thought that natural systems have fewer disease                       epidemics than crop systems, information on the distribution of                 genetic variation and the genetic basis for traits that control                 disease reactions in nature may prove useful in crop disease                    control.  Past work on the anther.smut fungal disease of the                    white campion revealed that the likelihood of infection for a                   plant depended on the genetic identity of both the plant and the                fungus.  In the current study, the mode of inheritance of plant                 resistance and fungal virulence will be examined; methods will                  include testing progeny of genetic crosses in both field studies                that mimic natural disease spread and in controlled greenhouse                  experiments.  This research will begin to determine if the                      relatively simple single gene control of disease expression found               with several crop plants also is prevalent outside of                           agriculture.",
