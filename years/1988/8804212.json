 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is for an Research Experiences for Undergraduates               site at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.  The program will run                  for 8 weeks during the summer and the students will actively                    engage in mathematical research.  The students will be guided by                four faculty members whose research interests cover graph theory,               matroid theory, and game theory.  These are all areas of discrete               mathematics and the projects all have an applied flavor.  Each                  student will be involved in reading mathematical literature,                    identifying interesting problems, synthesizing existing knowledge               in creative ways to solve problems, communicating work completed                in both oral and written forms, and collaborating with other                    students on different aspects of similar problems.  There will be               extensive formal and informal faculty interaction with students.                Several mechanisms are planned to facilitate each student's                     continued research into the following academic year.  An aim of                 this program is that the participants will be better prepared and               motivated to choose a career in research mathematics.",
