 "awd_abstract_narration": "The biggest challenges facing robotics today are issues dealing            with uncertainty, processor faults and self-organization.  The                  proposed research embodies a novel yet realistic approach to                    visually guided control of multijoint movement in uncertain                     environments.  It is based on a new network control theory that                 focuses on adaptive control principles, realized in parallel neural-            like networks.  This new adaptive control theory allows a control               system to adapt to most sets of kinematics while it learns a \"sense             of space\" by its own experience.  It uses both sensor and effector              constraints to adapt to its mechanical system over time and maintain            its adaptation to unforseen changes in the mechanics and sensor-                actuator calibrations.                                                               The essence of this proposal is involved in a representation of            visual targets in terms of actuator signals used to manipulate those            targets.  The proposed controller will learn precise sensory-motor              calibrations starting with only loosely defined relationships.  It              offers fast parallel processing that can be generalized to any                  number of joints at any resolution.  The proposed research combines             principles of neural organization within the constraints of                     engineering reality.",
