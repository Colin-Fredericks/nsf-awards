 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a reexamination of historical evidence on               labor market competition in light of current interest among                     macroeconomists with long run changes in wage stickiness.  Four                 indicators of labor market structure are examined:  job tenure,                 short run increasing returns to labor, the life expectancy of                   firms and the geographic mobility of products and laborers.                     Inferences from these indicators for change in labor market                     structure and macroeconmic adjustment processes are drawn.                              The interactive component includes co-directing the graduate            seminar in economic history, teaching an undergraduate course in                American economic history and participating in the Berkeley-                    Stanford Economic History Colloquium and the semi-annual                        conferences of the All-University of California Group in Economic               History.                                                                                This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1)              to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                  engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF                  and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and                     engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists                and enginemrs employed in industry, government, and academic                    institutions.  By encouraging the participation of women in                     science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future                     scientific vitality.",
