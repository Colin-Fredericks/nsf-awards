A                   training program in evolutionary biology is established for                     undergraduates interested in acquiring research experience.                     Under the guidance of appropriate faculty, students will receive                training in theoretical concepts, research problems, and various                biological techniques used to formulate and test hypotheses on                  these problems.  Students will be encouraged to become familiar                 with research being conducted in the laboratory before choosing a               specific research topic which they will explore in detail.                      Regular interactions between students and faculty are emphasized.               Students will attend a weekly inter-laboratory discussion group                 where they will be exposed to research projects conducted in                    other laboratories, as well as present and receive feedback on                  their own work.  Facilities and training are available so that                  students will be able to conduct independent or semi-independent                research on important questions in evolutionary biology.",
