 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop a theory of coprime                 fractional representations for nonlinear and time-varying systems               which is analogous to the theory of such representations available for          finite-dimensional linear time-invariant systems.  The basis for                developing such a theory for nonlinear and time-varying systems is              viewed to be input-output representations of these systems.  For                nonlinear input-output maps defined on some appropriate spaces, the             concepts of domain, range, and graph of the mapping are identified and          are viewed to be a basis for defining right coprime fractional                  representations of the mapping.  A right fractional representation of           a possibly unstable mapping as a ratio of two stable mappings is said           to be right coprime if it characterizes the graph of the mapping.  A            method of constructing right coprime fractional representations of              nonlinear systems based on this concept is proposed.  The method is             based on finding a stabilizing state-feedback for a state-variable              representation of the input-output map.  The concept of left coprime            fractional representation is also discussed.  Finally, the application          of this theory to analysis and synthesis of nonlinear feedback systems          is proposed.  The significance of the proposed research is in                   developing a design theory for nonlinear and time-varying systems               which takes advantage of many important results which have been                 obtained in the context of linear systems by using coprime fractional           representation methods.",
