 "awd_abstract_narration": "The existing saddle-point complex-rotation method will be                  extended to include relativistic effects, such as spin-orbit and                spin-spin perturbations.  This will permit prediction of spin-                  induced coupling and spin-induced autoionization, hopefully                     removing existing discrepancies between theory and experiment.                  The saddle-point method will also be investigated for systems                   with more complex vacancy structures, and it will be extended                   from three electron systems to four electron atomic systems.  The               basic idea of the method is to build vacancy orbitals with                      parameters directly into the total wave function.  The energy of                a multiply excited atomic state appears as a saddle-point in a                  variational calculation.  Only square integrable basis functions                are used.  The most distinctive advantage of the technique is                   gained in cases where the system is to highly excited that there                are an infinite number of open channels.",
