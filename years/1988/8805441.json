 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            designed to increase the participation of minorities in scientific and          engineering research.  The program provides support to strengthen the           research environments and capabilities of institutions that have                substantial minority student enrollments.  Eligible institutions must           also have graduate programs in science or programs in engineering.              Researchers at Texas Southern University will use RIMI support to               conduct research on the extraction of Group VIII metal ions from                aqueous solution.  Special attention will be given to any periodic              trends between the various halides, such as binary compounds of                 chlorine, fluorine, and iodine, and the Group VII metals (nickel,               pallodium, and platinum).  Investigators will propose mechanisms for            new extraction methods.  In addition, several variables such as the             rate of extraction, halide metal ratio, temperature and ionic strength          will be examined.  These studies will contribute to our knowledge of            water detoxification.                                                                                                                                           This project on extraction correlations and reactions will increase             the research and training capabilities of a predominantly minority              institution and will encourage more minorities to select careers in             science and engineering.  The principal investigator has widely                 published in the area of metal ions in agueous solution and is well             qualified to direct this study.",
