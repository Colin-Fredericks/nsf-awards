 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many fungi develop specialized infection structures, termed                 appressoria, which are necessary for successful penetration of                  their hosts.  Formation of these appressoria, a cell                            differentiation event, occurs when the fungus perceives specific                signals from the host.  In the bean rust fungus, Uromyces                       appendiculatus, such signals are entirely topographical and are                 located at stomata, the only sites at which the fungus can                      successfully penetrate the leaf of the host plant.  Previous                    research with this fungus has shown that the cytoskeleton is                    involved in mediating the signal for cell differentiation.  More                recent data suggest that the plasma membrane is involved in                     initial reception of the signal.  In the proposed continuation of               this research the role of the plasma membrane in signal reception               will be examined in greater detail.  Electrophysiological studies               of the membrane during signal reception will be done to determine               whether stretch-activated ion channels or ATPase pump activities                are primarily involved in the reception process.  Possible                      changes in the distribution of intramembrane particles during                   signal reception will also be characterized.  Finally,                          biochemical pathways known as membrane signal transducers in                    other systems will be sought in the plasma membrane of Uromyces.                   These studies will advance our knowledge of the mechanisms                   involved in the sensing responses that result in the accurate                   placement of the invading fungal appressorium over the host leaf                stomate during colonization of the host plant by the fungus.  The               significance of these experiments extends beyond the fungus-host                plant interaction, however.  Little is yet known about the                      mechanisms by which cells, in general, sense and respond to the                 physical features of their environment.  Stretch-activated ion                  channels in cell membranes have only recently been discovered,                  and their function in cellular sensing of mechanical stimuli has                been proposed, but not clearly established.  Studies in this                    interesting system, could therefore shed light on the general                   problem of the mechanism of mechanical sensitivity of cells, and                the possible role of stretch-activated ion channels in this                     process.",
