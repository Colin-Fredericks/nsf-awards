Each experience will be offered in conjunction with an agency         or organization which will be conducting scientific research on the             Alaskan North Slope.  Students will travel from their homes to actual           research sites where they will become involved in research methods and          scientific discovery with the guidance and support of field scientists.         Activities will include technological studies in marine science,                archaeological artifact analysis, soil core sample analysis, wildlife           census counts, land use surveys and caribou route mapping. Students             will be exposed to various career opportunities related to the research         projects in which they are involved.",
