 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a follow-up conference on structural failures by the                    Engineering Foundation Conference held in 1983.  The conference                 addresses primarily the practicing structural engineers.  Bridge                and building designers from other countries will also participate               in the meeting to share their experiences and the approaches to                 safety taken in their country.  The primary objectives of the                   conference are as follows:                                                                                                                                           1.  To review the recommendations of the 1983 conference on                         Building Structural Failures.                                               2.  To share the experience of designers in other countries                         in using various methods to insure safety.                                  3.  To identify more specifically the steps to be taken to                          ensure structural integrity.                                                4.  To communicate these findings to the practicing                        structural engineer.                                                                                                                                            The meeting will provide an effective forum to focus on the                     discussion of impact to the structural integrity by the new                     computers and computer technology, and by the increasing                        implementation of limited states design practice.",
