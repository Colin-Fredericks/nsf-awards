 "awd_abstract_narration": "One model system for the study of thyroid hormone action is amphibian           metamorphosis.  During the change from tadpole to frog an induction of          urea cycle enzymes occurs, and in particular a large increase of hepatic        ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) activity,  have been shown to be               induced by thryoid hormone. In this proposal one of the primary aims is         to determine the relationship between the time of thryoid hormone               administration and the changes in OTC mRNA and enzyme activity.  These          experiments will involve treating tadpoles for various periods of time          with thyroid hormones or selecting tadpoles during various stages of            natural metamorphosis and measuring the hepatic levels of OTC activity          and OTC mRNA levels using a tadpole OTC cDNA probe.  Dr. Jaffe will             analyze and compare the time course of the induction of OTC mRNA and            enzyme activity by thryoid hormones as well as the relative magnitude of        their induction.  Using similar techniques he will determine if the OTC         mRNA is induced in a tissue specific manner. The next series of                 experiments will employ nuclear run-on assays to determine the extent to        which the increase in OTC mRNA is due to a thyroid hormone effect at the        transcriptional level.  In addition, an analysis of the time course of          the change in transcription rate will be compared to the change in OTC          mRNA and enzyme activity.  The final series of experiments will be aimed        at cloning the tadpole OTC gene.  Various cell lines will be transfected        with chimeric plasmids constructed by ligation of the 5' flanking               regions and its various subfragments of the OTC gene to the                     chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, to determine the region                 responsible for the thyroid hormone inducibility and tissue specific            expression of OTC. If successful these studies will provide information         on the molecular action of thyroid hormone as well as the regulation of         development.",
