A new Aquatic Field Facility funded                 by the NSF EPSCoR Program at the University will allow talented                 undergraduates from seven Kentucky colleges and universities to                 be introduced to research in aquatic ecology.  From nominees                    provide by the seven institutions, ten students will be selected                and matched with the six faculty advisors.  To learn the relevant               techniques, students will begin an intensive eight-week summer                  session by participating in the advisor's ongoing projects.                     Within 2-3 weeks, the students will shift most of their effort                  onto independent research projects.  Informal weekly seminars                   during the summer, and evening seminars in the fall, will                       stimulate discussion and provide information on research careers                and on major research issues and methods.  After gathering and                  analyzing their own data and developing skills in critical                      analysis of the literature and effective scientific                             communication, the students will complete the program by                        presenting their project results orally at an in-house \"research                conference\".  This wide spectrum of research-related experiences                will significantly broaden the horizons of the participating                    students, many of whom would otherwise be unlikely to consider                  seriously the possibility of a career in research.",
