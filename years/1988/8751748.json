 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Northern California Science Project-Middle Grades is a cooperative          effort involving eight school districts in Central and Northern                 California and faculty and staff at the University of California, Davis.        The project will involve twenty-four teachers (each year for two years)         who regularly teach physical science to 7th and 8th grade students.                                                                                             During years one and two, the project will concentrate on training the          participants in teaching methodologies based on the constructivist              theory of learning.  All of the methodologies will be based on selected         topics in physical science.                                                                                                                                     The first two years will see the teachers involved in a two-day spring          workshop and a three-week summer institute.  During the academic year           following, the participants will be involved in five additional day long        workshops at each of eight districts sites, and visits by the program           staff to each teachers' classroom.                                                                                                                              During the second and third years, emphasis will also be placed on              documenting and assessing teachers' ability to use the teaching model in        typical 7th and 8th grade settings and the effect of its use on the             students conceptual understanding of selected physical science concepts.                                                                                        The University of California, Davis and the school districts have               contributed an amount equal to 25% of the NSF award.",
