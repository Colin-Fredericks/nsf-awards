 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of the influence of oxide supports (alumina and                 titania) and acidic or basic promoters upon the molecular structures            of supported vanadium-oxide catalysts and their corresponding                   catalytic chemistry.  Information on molecular structure is provided            by Raman spectroscopy, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, and X-           ray adsorption near-edge spectroscopy.  In situ spectroscopic studies           reveal the influence of the reaction environment upon the molecular             structures of surface vanadium oxide.  Reactivity of the catalysts is           determined from studies of catalytic oxidation of methane and                   methanol.                                                                                                                                                       The objective of this work is to develop structure-activity                     relationships for supported metal-oxide catalysts; such an achievement          would make feasible the design of catalysts for specific applications.          Supported vanadium oxide is chosen as the initial model because it has          unusually diverse catalytic chemistry, its inorganic and structural             chemistry has been studied by others, and it gives strong signals for           powerful characterization techniques.",
