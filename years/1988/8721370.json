 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a result of a prior NSF-supported study, an appreciation was                 developed for a number of important aspects of earthquake recurrence            modeling and ground motion forecasting.  The objective of this                  research program is to investigate some of these aspects of the                 overall non-Poissonian seismic hazard model for a particular site.                                                                                              The results of this study will provide a unified approach that will             enable estimation of the hazard resulting from future earthquake-               induced ground motions at a site, based upon geophysical                        characterization of the ground motion and in the form of various                ground motion parameters.                                                                                                                                       The implications of the hazard model and site ground motion forecasts           for earthquake resistant design and damage is also being investigated.                                                                                          Extensive modifications are being made to existing hazard prediction            models.  Earthquake data from Mexico, California, and Alaska are being          used for model testing and parameter estimation.  Various model                 parameters are being tested for sensitivity and the model is being              applied to three locations.  The result is the development of a                 generalized computer model for seismic hazard analysis at particular            site locations.",
