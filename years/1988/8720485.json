The system will be used                  primarily in the continued study of the stellar populations in                  elliptical galaxies.  The comprehensive project will be carried                 out on three fronts.                                                                                                                                            The first is a differential study, intercomparing a large number                of normal ellipticals using a variety of methods to search for                  and analyze the differences found, if any, between galaxies.  The               techniques used will be based on principal component analysis and               related statistical methods, plus a differential analysis                       developed in a previous study of spherical (SO) galaxies.                                                                                                       A more traditional approach to the study of stellar populations                 in galaxies is ordinary spectral synthesis.  This approach will                 also be used to investigate the content of elliptical galaxies,                 but improved by a better stellar library, greater wavelength                    coverage, and a larger sample size than used by previous                        investigations.                                                                                                                                                 Finally, the problem of the evolution of ellipticals over the                   lifetime of the Universe will be addressed using the differential               approach employed above.  Spectra of high redshift, red, and                    radio-quiet elliptical galaxies will be analyzed differently with               respect to present epoch objects, to determine the extent and                   magnitude of any evolution that has occurred.",
