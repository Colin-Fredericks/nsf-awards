 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to establish a center that will                    provide the facilities for the simulation, analysis and display                 of macromolecular structures.  The equipment will provide the                   capability for high-resolution simulation and display of protein                and nucleic acid structures.  The capability will include the                   display of atoms of macromolecules and solvent molecules, energy                minimization with flexible geometry, manipulation of specific                   residues, etc. with currently available software.  Thus molecular               biologists and chemists will be able to display and minipulate                  complex molecules and simulate the interactions.  Additionally                  the center will mediate the interactions between participants                   and facilitate the development of new software directed at                      solving specific problems, many of which come under the heading                 of \"computer-aided protein engineering.\"  In collaboration with                 A. Warshel, simulation approaches to predicting the effects of                  site-directed alterations of protein structure will be accessible               for general use and refined or modified for specific                            applications.  Thus the center will facilitate collaboration                    between experimental groups and experts in theoretical analysis                 as well as facilitate the development of methodology that will                  have a major impact on the wider scientific community.  Support                 is recommended.",
