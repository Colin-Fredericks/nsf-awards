 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is a combined experimental and theoretical investigation          of aerosol reactors for synthesis of high quality powders for ceramic           applications.  The powders to be studied are silicon nitride and                various metal oxides.  Size distributions of the powders produced will          be measured as a function of gas composition, temperature, residence            time, and other relevant variables.  Powders will be characterized as           to chemical composition and crystallinity by atomic absorption                  spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction.  The suitability of the powders             for ceramic application will be evaluated in an ongoing study at                another institution.  The reactor will be modeled accounting for                particle nucleation, particle growth by condensation and coagulation,           and aggregate shape change by sintering.                                                                                                                        Aerosol reactors offer exciting processes for producing powders of              unique properties for use in ceramic, optical, electrical, or                   catalytic applications.  This research should help in the design  and           optimization of such reactors.",
