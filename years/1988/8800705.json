 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant, funded jointly by Special Projects in Chemistry and                 the Division of Materials Research provides support for the                     research of Profs. Stair and Weitz at Northwestern University.                  The objective of the research is to study, both experimentally                  and theoretically, the photodissociation dynamics of small                      molecules adsorbed on single-crystal insulator surfaces. Such                   information is of importance to the understanding of                            photochemistry at the gas-solid interface.                                                                                                                      In addition to studies of the adsorption and surface chemistry                  of the adsorbed molecular species, the experimental program                     will also focus on measurements of the angular distribution,                    the kinetic energy distribution and the rotational and                          vibrational distributions of the photodissociated fragments.                    The molecules to be studied were selected as representative                     examples of rapid direct and predissociative photodissociation                  mechanisms on the basis of gas phase photodissociation                          measurements.  They also provide both atomic and molecular                      fragments that are amenable to high sensitivity detection as                    well as theoretical description. The magnesium oxide adsorbant                  surface was selected for its insulating properties,ease of                      handling and characterization and its chemical stability.                       Theoretical models to be developed will aim at calculating the                  experimentally measured fragment distributions.",
