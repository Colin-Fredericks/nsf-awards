 "awd_abstract_narration": "The characteristics of a number of recurrent weather systems               observed in the Rocky Mountains and western United States will be               examined under the direction of Professor Bosart.  While case                   studies of some weather systems first appeared in literature                    several decades ago, little has followed since. One example is                  the so called \"Nevada low\", which generally forms in spring east                of the Sierras when the 500 mb flow is southwesterly. A                         precursor lee trough is often seen from Oregon to southern                      Nevada.  What are the life cycle, dynamic and thermal structures                of the Nevada lows? Do they play any role in the later                          cyclogenesis downstream? If so, how?  These Nevada lows are                     believed to be different from Colorado or Mediterranean lows,                   mostly attributed to differences in the physical dimensions and                 characteristics of local terrain.  Besides leading to a better                  understanding, a careful study should also aid in the                           interpretation and utilization of predictions from numerical                    models.",
