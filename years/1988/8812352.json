 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Complex Systems Research Center of the University of                   New Hampshire will acquire the computer equipment necessary to                  create a unified remote sensing/georeferenced computer                          workstation for regional to global scale ecosystem modeling.  The               workstation will enhance existing facilities in the Institute for               the Study of Earth, Oceans and Space at the university.  New                    research initiatives in global ecosystem studies and landscape                  ecology demand mathematical models with improved spatial                        resolution and data with georeferenced characteristics.  Remote                 sensing systems and Geographic Information Systems offer the                    possibility for obtaining the necessary data.  Yet, these                       components remain only discrete unrelated pieces of a potentially               integrated system. This project will bring these pieces together                into a highly effective remote sensing georeferenced modeling                   system.                                                                              The computer workstation will have capabilities for: a) grid               and raster GIS, b) vector GIS, c) remote sensing and image                      processing, d) point data management, e) array process, f) large                database management (eg. windowing) g) graphics, h) data capture                and analysis, and i) mathematical modeling.  Support and                        facilities at the institution are excellent as is the primary                   group of scientists who will make use of the facilities.                             The research that the facility is capable of enhancing will                be of fundamental importance at a basic level. Additionally,                    global considerations such as climate change, biological                        diversity and acid precipitation will be addressable by the                     newcapabilities.                                                                     An award is strongly recommended by the Ecosystem Studies                  Program.",
