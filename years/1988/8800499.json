 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project analyzes how legislative constituencies and                   issue configurations are related to the formulation of social                   policy legislation in the House of Representatives during the                   Progressive Era decades of 1900-1920.  Legislative constituencies               are defined on the basis of state legislative action on social                  policy issues that then subsequently reach a roll call vote at                  the National level.  By examining the relationship between state                level legislative roll call voting and subsequent voting outcomes               in the Federal legislature, it will be possible to investigate                  how social policy formulation shifts from the state to the                      National level in these decades, thereby setting the stage for                  the New Deal Era to follow.  Issue configurations will be                       assessed in terms of whether the Progressive Era, noted for                     democratic reform, produced issue clusters that were                            unidimensional or multi-dimensional in structure.  Of particular                importance will be the alignment of civil rights and social                     welfare issues, the former representing legal and procedural                    principles of democracy and the latter economic and outcome                     principles of democracy.  With the recent decades of the social                 and political change of the 1960s in mind, we will evaluate how                 the social and political change defining the inauguration of the                twentieth century linked these dual principles of democratic                    demands for social policy formulation.  With these perspectives                 in mind, passage of the Nineteenth Amendment--enfranchising                     women--will be examined as a case in point.  The particular issue               alignments on this legislation as well as the influence of state                level constituencies will be examined in the context of civil                   rights and social policy issue dimensions.                                           Dr. McDonagh will also conduct a lecture series on Gender                  and Social Science, serve as a mentor and advisor to                            undergraduates in the Women's Studies Concentration at Harvard/                 Radcliffe, and supervise an undergraduate research assistant.                        This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1)                 to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                  engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF                  and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and                     engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists                and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic                    institutions.  By encouraging the participation of women in                     science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future                     scientific vitality.",
