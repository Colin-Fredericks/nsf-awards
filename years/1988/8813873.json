 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematicians at the University of Illinois  will investigate methods          by which the teaching of calculus can me made more effective in                 conveying to students and understanding of calculus as a powerful               problem solving tool.  Course material planning will focus on the               development of the problem sets that will lead students through the             central ideas and methods of calculus and enhance their ability to read         and write mathematics.                                                                                                                                          The project will consult with user departments in science, engineering          and other areas; develop and class test course material for Calculus I          based on an approach of Artin; focus on computational and problem               solving;  and develop student's capacity to read and write mathematics          correctly and coherently.                                                                                                                                       A weekly Calculus Seminar will train teaching assistants and discuss            content among faculty within and outside the mathematics department.            In the Summer of 1989, a Calculus Workshop for UI faculty and high              school teachers will be held.                                                                                                                                   The integration of computer technology with use of Mathematica                  software in the calculus curriculum will be supported by outside                funds.",
