 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term objectives of this study are to provide                      insights into the ways in which particular elements of the                      neuromuscular junction work.  The strategy is to make                           quantitative structure-function correlations in situations where                the difference in function can be specified, and where the                      corresponding structure is of special interest or relevance to                  synaptic transmission.  The first group of comparisons will be                  among a series of three types of neuromuscular junctions which                  appear to differ in synaptic strength.  The quantal content of                  the junctions will be estimated, and the probability of                         transmitter release at a single site for each type of junction                  will be compared with the intramembranous particle composition of               its active zones as seen in freeze-fractured samples.  A clear                  correlation between the number of particles observed at an active               zone and the probability of release would support (but not prove)               the hypothesis that some or all of these particles represent                    calcium channels.  The methods include making intracellular and                 extracellular recordings from muscle fibers from the appropriate                populations to obtain data for a quantal analysis.  The same or                 comparable samples would then be fixed and prepared for freeze-                 fracture, thin-section, or scanning electron microscopic study of               their ultrastructure.  Each technique contributes to the                        structural data, which can be analyzed to obtain estimates of the               average number of particles per active zone, the total number of                active zones per junction, and the total number and length of                   junction per muscle fiber.  Although the presence and role of                   calcium channels in synaptic transmission is well supported by                  physiological data, and the likelihood that they lie close to or                within the morphological structure known as the active zone has                 been previously suggested, there is no direct evidence to                       describe their structure or precise location.  Lacking an                       irreversible blocker for the calcium channel or similar \"label\"                 to precisely define their location, the experiments above                       represent the most reasonable approach to the question.                              Dr. Rheuben will participate in the Advanced Neurobiology                  Laboratory, which is a graduate level laboratory course in                      electrophysiology.  She will also participate in the Neurobiology               Journal Discussion series, which meets to discuss and critique                  recent papers of interest.  In addition, she will organize an                   informal seminar series oriented toward graduate and under-                     graduate students.                                                                    This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1)                to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                  engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF                  and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and                     engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists                and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic                    institutions.  By encouraging the participation of women in                     science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future                     scientific vitality.",
