 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most paleoceanographic studies of the geochemistry of                   benthic foraminifera have concentrated on the North Atlantic                    because of the abundance of fossil remains in sediments of this                 region and because of the importance of the region as a source                  for deep water in the oceans. Micropaleontologic and geochemical                studies in this area indicate major deep circulation changes                    during glacial/interglacial cycles. In contrast, little is known                about circulation in the northern Pacific since the microfossil                 record of these changes is poorly preserved in the deep water                   sediments of the region. Recent results from shallow sediments,                 however, suggest that the North Pacific may have been a source of               intermediate or deep water during glacial conditions.                                   The present award will support a field and laboratory                   program to collect and analyze sediments from the northernmost                  Emperor seamount chain. The objective of the field program is to                collect a depth transect of cores from the region of Detroit                    Seamount and use geochemical and paleontologic techniques to                    establish the paleohydrography of the north Pacific. Laboratory                 analyses will include carbon-14 and Cd/Ca ratios. Cores will be                 collected on a separately funded cruise of the R.V. Washington.                 The results of this project will be important in formulating                    plans for deep ocean drilling in the North Pacific.",
