 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for a Research Experiences for                  Undergraduates Site at the University of Virginia.  This project                will expand the base of support available to undergraduate                      students working in Psychobiology research laboratories within                  the Department of Psychology at the University.  This award                     provides summer stipends and modest supply budgets for 9                        undergraduate students to serve as undergraduate research                       assistants during the summer months.  Undergraduates will be                    selected from the University of Virginia as well as predominantly               black colleges and universities in the immediate region (i.e.                   Howard University, Norfolk State University, Virginia Union                     University, etc).  Each student will be assigned to a faculty                   preceptor who will direct his/her daily activities.  In addition                to their laboratory assignments, all students will meet every                   other week in a formal seminar with one of the faculty preceptor                to discuss research issues in Psychobiology.  Finally, each                     student will present a research seminar at the end of the summer                which summarizes his/her research effort.  This program, we hope                will provide encouragement to promising undergraduates to                       consider careers in laboratory research in Psychobiology.",
