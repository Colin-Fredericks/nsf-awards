 "awd_abstract_narration": "This model project is designed to encourage precollege minority                 students (Grades 8-12) to consider careers in science and mathematics           teaching at the precollege level. Activities being implemented include          identifying minority students in their junior and senior years, who             show interest in and promise of becoming teachers, and who show                 potential for attending college; encouraging the graduating seniors             among them to attend summer school at Southside Virginia Community              College (SVCC) to make up as many deficiencies as possible-- those              seniors can then enroll in the full university parallel curriculum at           SVCC in the fall semester. Those juniors identified by the same                 criteria may make up their deficiencies during the summer and                   throughout the academic year at SVCC. A special counseling process will         also be initiated for them, including a minority mentor/advisor from            the school faculty. In addition, minority students with an interest in          and potential for becoming teachers are being identified in grades 8-           10, and a guidance staff person will be assigned to each student to             develop an appropriate high school course plan. During the first year           of the project, the Center Director and appropriate SVCC personnel work         closely with Longwood College and Virginia Commonwealth University              (VCU) to develop an articulation transfer agreement from SVCC to those          institutions. Upon completion of their in-residence requirements for a          teaching credential, students are placed in schools within their county         of residence for student teaching. Students who successfully complete           the teaching program at either Longwood College or VCU will be given            priority consideration for positions available in their resident                county.",
