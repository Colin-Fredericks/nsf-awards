 "awd_abstract_narration": "Highly-correlated f-electron metals, especially those that show                 heavy Fermion behavior, will form the main thrust of this                       project.  Emphasis will be on how the coupling of the f-electron                atom to its environment affects optical properties and light                    scattering.  When Raman-active modes are found whose intensity,                 as with URu2Si2, increases upon the gradual onset of the heavy-                 Fermion state, a magnetic field will be used to suppress the                    onset and the effect in the spectra will be observed.  Waves in                 magnetically-ordered states and magnetic excitations will be                    studied.  The strong electronic Gruneisen effect will be                        exploited by measuring Raman spectra under pressure.  The Raman                 results will be correlated with known elastic constant results                  and new ones to be obtained using Brillouin scattering.  Raman                  and optical-property measurements will be made on the new high Tc               superconductors.  Emphasis will be placed on the effects of                     surface treatment, especially control of oxygen content on the                  spectra.  The role of structural distortions will be elucidated                 by Raman Brillouin scattering measurements.  Correlations will be               made with superconducting and structural measurements made by                   collaborators.",
