Givnish and Sytsma of the University of Wisconsin are                 studying the evolutionary history of species of the genus                       Brocchinia of the pineapple family, Bromeliaceae.  This group of                plants is of scientific interest because they are considered                    primitive members of the family and may be transitional to                      advanced epiphytic forms, because they are native to the most                   ancient part of South America, the Guyana Shield, and because                   they have evolved a remarkable range of means for capturing                     mineral nutrients including carnivory, symbiotic nitrogen                       fixation, and feeding by ants.                                                       The investigators will collect specimens of the estimated 21               species of the genus in Venezuela, Brazil, and Colombia.  They                  will assess genomic relationships among species through analysis                of chloroplast DNA.  Comparison of these results with study of                  floral and vegetative traits will permit evaluation of the                      reliability of traditional anatomical characters in taxonomic                   classifications.  The goal of the research is to understand how                 the species evolved, how they have adpated to conditions of                     extreme soil infertility, and how they have dispersed through                   geological time across the northern range of South America.",
