 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of the marine biology of Antarctic coastal and oceanic                  environments date back well over a century.  Past and contemporary              studies of Antarctic marine biology have revealed a rich and varied             marine biota, in many respects unlike any temperate or tropical                 counterpart.  Collectively, these studies have been of great interest           to Antarctic and non-Antarctic biologists alike.  However, non-                 Antarctic biologists rarely have access to meetings devoted to                  Antarctic marine biology.  McClintock and Pearse request funds to               support a national symposium which will review past, current and                future directions in the field of Antarctic marine biology for non-             Antarctic researchers.  The symposium will be held in conjunction with          the joint American Society of Zoologists (ASZ)/Western Society of               Naturalists (WSN) meeting Dec. 27-31, 1988 in San Fransisco,                    California.  Fourteen invited speakers, who are among the foremost              researchers in the field, will present an overview of the marine                biology of this unique environment.  Invitations to attend the                  symposium will be sent to approximately 100 polar marine biologists,            and an announcement will be forwarded to members of the ASZ and WSN,            and be published in a variety of scientific journals.  Proceedings              will be published in the American Zoologist.  The symposium will                provide a unique opportunity for non-Antarctic biologists to become             familiar with important topics in Antarctic marine biology from those           who are at the forefront of the field.",
