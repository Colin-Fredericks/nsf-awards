 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with the development of a computer model                for surface grinding.  The goal of this research is to predict the              processing parameters in order to minimize workpiece damage and                 optimize surface quality.  The mathematical model should permit                 calculation of the temperature and stress fields, the extent of any             thermally induced phase transformations and the magnitude of the                residual stresses.  The model considers the fully coupled                       thermomechanical field equations, with coupling through the                     dilatational work, the plastic work, and the heat release during                any phase transformation in the energy balance equation.  A simple              finite element model developed under a previous grant (DMC-8414917)             provided data on grinding of an alloy steel (AISI 4340), a carbon               steel (AISI 1038), and a stainless steel (AISI 304) which are in                quantitative agreement with experimental data.  The present work                will refine the previous model to enhance its applicability,                    computational speed, and accuracy.  Parametric studies will be made             to identify critical process parameters of the grinding process.                Once these computations are completed, attempts will be made to                 develop a second generation computer model which will refine both               the computational process and the material properties used in the               model.  In addition, the model will be extended to examine                      additional grinding processes such as multiple pass and cylindrical             grinding.",
