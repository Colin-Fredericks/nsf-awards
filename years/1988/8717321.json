 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal builds on and extends prior theory and experimental               research related to the problem of sharing benefits and dividing the            costs of providing a common good such as public safety or parks.  A             related question involves individual voluntary collective action when           volunteering time or making voluntary contributions to charities.  The          theoretical foundation of the research rests on bayesian game theoretic         equilibrium models on the basis of which predictions of the expected            behaviors can be derived.  The basic experimental methods involves              using human subjects in carefully controlled laboratory situations              involving incomplete information and communications between subjects.           Individual subjects are asked to make decisions about contributing and          are informed exactly how much they will be paid by the experimenter,            depending upon their contribution decisions and the decisions of                others.  The experiments explore individual voluntary collective                actions under a range of conditions and will provide insights as to the         different types of choice strategies which individuals utilize in these         experiments.",
