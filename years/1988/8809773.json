 "awd_abstract_narration": "For a new specialty area in science to be established, it must be               in some sense be \"institutionalized.\"  The new specialty must be                taught to new students who will perpetuate it; it must have                     facilities to carry out the scientific studies which advance the                research frontier;  it must have support to finance this                        research; it must have journals which will publish the research                 emanating from the labs;  and it must have academic recognition                 and status in order that it's adherents will have positions to                  hold.  The accrual of these institutional characteristics of a                  specialty are essential if a specialty is to survive and thrive.                These characteristics, however, do not automatically come to                    promising new ideas in science.  The history of science is                      replete with potential new specialty areas which failed to                      survive because insufficient or ineffective attention was paid to               the institutionalization of the specialty.  Professor Holmes is                 examining the process of institutionalization of a new specialty                in the context of one of the most important and productive areas                of science in the 19th century: Justus Liebig's \"Giessen School\"                of organic chemistry.  Professor Holmes' study will make                        substantial new contributions to our understanding of the                       organization of science and the formation of research schools,                  the symbiotic connections between pedagogy and research, the                    formation of scientific specialties, debates about the social                   construction of scientific knowledge, and other issues centering                on experimental practice in science.                                                                                                                            Justus Liebig is one of the most celebrated 19th century                        scientists.  His influence on the development of organic                        chemistry, agricultural chemistry, and animal chemistry are more                than matched by his fame  as founder of the first large-scale                   teaching-research laboratory, the \"Giessen School.\"  Professor                  Holmes, under this grant will examine and integrate the three                   dimensions of Liebig's career as a chemical investigator, teacher               and leader in the formation of the discipline of organic                        chemistry.  Although the study will be centered upon the role of                Liebig in the establishment of the new specialty, he will give                  ample attention to the roles played in this process by Jacob                    Berzelius, Joseph Gay-Lussac, Jean-Baptiste Dumas, Frederich                    Wohler and others who played less prominent parts.  The sources                 for this study are contained in the research articles of the                    specialized journals of the period, in textbooks and published                  lectures, and private papers, correspondence, and diaries in                    various archives in Germany.",
