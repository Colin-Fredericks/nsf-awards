 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal presents a program of theoretical and experimental                work directed toward a predictive theory of drying.  The                        influence of local heterogeneities is incorporated into both the                theoretical framework and the experimental measurements that were               proposed.  The theoretical analysis is based on the method of                   large-scale averaging and a closure scheme that incorporates the                effect of local heterogeneities.  The experimental studies make                 use of nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI) to both quantify the           heterogeneities in a porous medium and to measure the local volume              averaged saturation during drying.  Determination of the spatial                variation of the local volume averaged saturation will provide                  experimental values of the large-scale spatial deviation of the                 saturation.  These in turn, will be compared with predictions from the          closure calculations.                                                                                                                                           The key feature of the method of large-scale averaging is the                   appearance of large-scale spatial deviations in the velocity and                concentration, and the existence of a closure scheme that can predict           these spatial deviations.  In all previous studies of transport                 phenomena in porous media, theory and experiment have been compared in          terms of measured and predicted effective transport coefficients.               With the use of NMRI, the PI's are in a position to develop the                 comparison beyond the level of the effective transport coefficients             and make a direct comparison between calculated and measured                    large-scale spatial deviations.  The process of drying is of interest           to a very wide range of engineering and scientific practitioners who            are concerned with moisture transport in final or intermediate                  products.  Some of these applications are given as follows:  in                 agricultural products, paints and inks, wood, gels, soils, catalyst             pellets, and foams.  This investigation should permit a greater                 understanding of this important transport process.",
