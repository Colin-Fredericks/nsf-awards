 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project are to analyze the effectiveness and              compactness of an innovative approach for recovering and reusing the            wasted energy from a typical combustion system.  Such energy recovery           and reuse are achieved by employing small particles encapsulating a             phase-change material.  To successfully accomplish the proposed                 objectives, it is necessary to analyze the fluid dynamics and heat              transfer problem both theoretically and experimentally.  The theory             involves a numerical solution to a formulation of the conservation              equations for mass, momentum, energy and radiation.  The experiments,           which employ solid particles to verify empirical relations used in the          theory, include measurements of velocities and temperatures of the gas          and particles by standard methods.                                                                                                                              The proposed work could be of significant interest to power and                 industrial plants for several reasons.  First, its use, either as               retrofitted or in new installations, should yield significant savings           in fuel over conventional fixed or rotary heat exchangers.  Second,             the unit is operable and particles cleanable from unburnt fuel and              dirt on a continuous basis, resulting in improved thermodynamic                 conversion efficiencies and better control of the oxides of nitrogen            formation.  Finally, the particles may act as scrubbing media for               removal of particulate matter and gaseous pollutants, thus serving a            dual purpose:  recovery of wasted energy and pollutant control.",
