This program is                designed to encourage minority and other underrepresented                       students to consider graduate training and careers in the                       biological, agricultural, and resource sciences.  SUAARP has                    been in existence for six years and has hosted 61 students.                     Approximately 41% of these students have attended or are                        presently enrolled in graduate or professional programs.  This                  year nine students who have completed at least two years of                     college-level education will be invited to spend eight weeks on                 the Davis campus, working with a specially selected faculty                     member on a research project of mutual interest.  Students are                  expected to work 40 hours/week as integral members of a research                team, participating in laboratory meetings and other lab-related                activities.  Students are enrolled in Summer Session I and II and               receive 5 units of independent study credit.",
