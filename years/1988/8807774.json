 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to conduct research on a process that          has the potential for decontamination of water that contains organic            substances in solution that make the water unfit for its intended use.          This is a renewal of research that was initiated under an expedited             award for novel research with reference to NSF Grant No. 8612487,               results of which indicated that high-energy electron irradiation of             water containing benzene, chlorobenzene, and polychlorobiphenyls                resulted in their degradation producing new compounds that were in              general more polar and therefore more soluble in water than the                 original contaminants.  However, it was also found that the presence            of polyethylene oxide during irradiation resulted in a substantial              decrease of those fragments in solution.  This suggested the                    possibility that contaminant free radical species formed during                 irradiation in the presence of a polymer are coupled to radical-sites           formed on the dissolved polymer and that contaminant species could be           subsequently removed by sand-filtration or some other conventional              water treatment physical and/or chemical process.                                                                                                               The presence of organic contaminants in water is a National problem of          considerable significance as this presence relates to usefulness of             surface and groundwaters for municipal and industrial purposes.  It is          possible that further research on this concept of linking a radiation           process with                                                                    conventional water                                                              and wastewater treatment technologies would provide a new system for            decontamination of water polluted by the presence of organic substances.",
