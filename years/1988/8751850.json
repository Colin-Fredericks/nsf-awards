 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thirty outstanding secondary school science teachers, fifteen                   from middle schools and fifteen from high schools, will be                      selected from around the nation to participate in a two-week                    summer workshop.  These teachers who have demonstrated potential                leadership abilities in science education will study evolution,                 behavior, and unique hazards associated with the Cascade Range                  volcanoes in general, and Mt. St. Helens in particular. The                     comprehensive two week program will include formal classroom                    activities, discussions, computer simulations, video, and field                 work.                                                                                                                                                           Participants will develop instructional materials during and                    after the workshop suitable for use in their local setting.                     School districts will support their teachers by contributing                    money for materials and providing released time for the                         presentation of workshops to fellow teachers and members of the                 local community. A long term, comprehensive follow-up and                       evaluation program will feature involvement of participants                     administrators, members of the academic community in participant                locales and project staff.                                                                                                                                      This project brings together many elements of the science                       education community, namely, a set of experienced teachers,                     academic community, federal agency and private sector                           instructors, school district administrators and an exciting                     environment as the setting for the project.",
