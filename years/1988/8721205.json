 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide partial funding toward the purchase                of a computer system to meet the scientific needs of the Caltech                Seismology Laboratory. The system requested consists of a network               of workstations, fileservers, and a vector.parallel                             superminicomputer connected to each other and to the national                   supercomputers by high.speed links. Over 50% matching funds will                be provided by the Institute and private industry.                                   Computers are the main research tools of the faculty and                   students of the Seismological Laboratory. They will become                      increasingly important as more digital seismic data become                      available and as more observational constraints and deeper                      understanding of the underlying physics drive increasingly                      sophisticated modeling efforts in tectonophysics, mineral physics,              and planetary geophysics. The Caltech Seismological Laboratory has              been a leader in all of these areas of research, and the new                    computer system will allow them access to parallel and vector                   architectures and the software tools to carry it out in a modern                computational environment.",
