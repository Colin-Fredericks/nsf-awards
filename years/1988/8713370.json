 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year cooperative research project between         Professor Hans J. Bohnert, Department of Biochemistry, University of            Arizona, and Dr. Wolfgang Loeffelhardt, Institute for General                   Biochemistry, University of Vienna, Austria.   The scientists and               members of their research groups will study the genome and gene                 structure of cyanelle DNA from Cyanophora paradoxa.  They will attempt          to determine (1) the structure of several genes/operons on cyanelle DNA         which are differently organized in cyanelle and higher plant                    chloroplast DNA and (2) the extent to which the cyanelle is dependent           on import of proteins from the surrounding cytoplasm and how this               transport is achieved, either differently from or identically to the            transport in higher plants.  The long-term goal of the work is to               understand, by monitoring differences between the well-studied higher           plant chloroplast characteristics and the cyanelle genome, which                evolutionary options were available to permit a photosynthetically              active organelle to be integrated into the metabolism of a eukaryotic           cell.                                                                                                                                                           The cyanelle in Cyanophora paradoxa is an example of a plastid, a               membrane-enclosed component of a plant cell.  Chloroplasts in leaves            are another, better-known example.  In this study, the cooperating              scientists will carry out biochemical and molecular biological studies          aimed at demonstrating the degree of relatedness of cyanelle genes to           those in higher plant chloroplasts and to cyanobacterial genes.  The            work involves sequencing several cyanelle chromosome regions selected           for their anticipated value in making these comparisons.  In this way           it may be possible to gather evidence for the evolution of specific             genes from simple bacteria through Cyanophora paradoxa to still higher          plants, such as trees.  Professor Bohnert is experienced in molecular           biology and plant genetics.  Professor Loeffelhardt is a biochemist             with experience in working with the proteins to be studied in these             experiments.  Their expertise will be combined in a study which is              expected to shed light on the evolution of genes that are located in            different cellular compartments in an organism whose evolutionary               history is not well understood.",
