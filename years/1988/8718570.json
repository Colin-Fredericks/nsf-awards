 "awd_abstract_narration": "The process of cell-cell recognition represents a fundamental                   process which underlies many developmental events.  The                         proposed research is designed to examine the recognition                        events which take place early in angiosperm fertilization                       using experimental methodologies of both molecular biology                      and genetics.  Molecular methods will be used to characterize                   the S-locus gene family which is known to be involved in                        recognition reactions in self-incompatible plants and has                       recently been shown to exist in self-compatible plants as                       well.  These genes will be characterized as to their                            structure and expression in the self-compatible crucifer                        Arabidopsis thaliana.  Genetic methods will be used to obtain                   mutations which result in the interruption of the normal                        cell-cell recognition process.  These mutants will be                           characterized by various means including experiments to                         determine if irradiated wild-type pollen can provide trans-                     acting substances sufficient to restore the mutant plants to                    fertility.                                                                                                                                                      The proposed research will characterize one family of genes                     known to be involved in cell-cell interactions and should                       also allow the identification of other genes which are                          required for this process.  These genes can then be further                     characterized to build a more complete picture of the events                    involved in a cell-cell recognition reaction.",
