The symposium          will cover the topics of nitrogen sources for rice, physiology and              ecology of nitrogen fixation, biology of root and stem-nodule forming           rhizobia, recombinant DNA application in rice culture, and agronomic            aspects of nitrogen fixation.  The binational workshop will consider            plant-rhizobium interactions, molecular understanding and manipulation          of the rice genome, the interaction between rice and associated                 microflora and the molecular manipulation of associated cyanobacteria.          The workshop is to result in a report summarizing the                           state-of-knowledge in these areas, and specifying areas of problems for         viable research to be proposed jointly by scientists from the U.S. and          India.                                                                                                                                                          Scope:  The two topics of nitrogen fixation and molecular biotechnology         are of great interest in the U.S. and in India.  They relate to various         applications, one of which is agricultural productivity.  Rice is a             major crop in the U.S. and is crucial to nutrition in India and other           South Asian countries.  Collaboration on researching the parameters             affecting nitrogen fixation and the application to rice production              would be worthwhile scientifically and economically to the U.S. and             India.",
