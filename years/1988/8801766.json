 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are dramatic differences in processing of glycoprotein N-                 linked oligosaccharides (OLS) at different stages during                        development of D. discoideum.  Recent studies with wild type and                mutant strains have provided strong evidence for a role of two                  cell surface-derived OLS in intercellular recognition and                       cohesion during late aggregation. These OLS are not detectable at               earlier and later developmental stages.  The proposed research                  will establish the chemical structure of these glycans, using a                 combination of fast atom bombardment/mass spectrometry in                       collaboration with Dr. Catherine Costello at M.I.T. and using                   specific glycosidase treatments.  These results will be extended                to analysis of structure/function relations by specific                         degradative treatments to ascertain effects on cohesion                         inhibition by the OLS and by study of specific mutant strains                   conditionally defective in both OLS assembly and cohesion.  The                 exact  contribution of these OLS to cohesion, in comparison with                known glycoproteins implicated in cohesion, will be tested by                   efforts to inhibit aggregation with combinations of glycans and                 other perturbing agents, including antibodies.  Monoclonal                      antibodies will be generated by immunization with glycopeptides                 carrying the OLS, after covalent conjugation to a carrier protein               such as BSA.  These antibodies will also be used for                            identification of the in vivo glycoproteins which carry the OLS                 and for isolation of mutants lacking them and of revertants which               have recovered them.                                                            %%%                                                                             A large proportion of the proteins in higher organisms carry                    complex sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) as part of their                     structure. These oligosaccharides contribute to the functional                  properties of the proteins in ways that are not well                            characterized but are known to be important in cell-cell                        adhesion.  Dr. Henderson has undertaken a structure/function                    analysis of oligosaccharides known to be involved in the                        aggregation of cells during development.
