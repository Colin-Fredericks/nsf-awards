 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a collaborative project, Drs. Amy Jean Gilmartin of                  Washington State University and Greg Brown of The University of                 Wyoming are studying the morphology, chromosomes, and breeding                  systems of select members of the tropical Bromeliaceae, the                     pineapple family. Among the 2100 species of the family, at least                half grow as epiphytes upon other plants, although without                      parasitic effect on the host. Many are succulents that are able                 to survive on limited and sporadic sources of moisture. The                     evolution of these xeric (dry-loving) plants is one critical                    question which this research will help to answer.                                       The project enlists the aid of 16 resident botanists from               nine Latin American countries. These individuals and their                      students collect specimens including vials of floral buds for                   chromosome analysis. This network of resident collectors has                    proven effective and has stimulated more general collecting in                  several South American countries. The primary focus of the                      continuing taxonomic work is on the large and difficult genus of                \"Spanish moss\" plants, Tillandsia. Completed work will improve                  species recognition in this group, map geographic distributions                 throughout native ranges, and provide an analysis of evolutionary               relationships among the species.",
