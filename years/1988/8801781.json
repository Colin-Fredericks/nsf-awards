 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation award will support an investigation of          the place of cartography and science in nineteenth-century industrial           development and imperial domination.  The research will focus on the            British geodetic surveys undertaken by the East India Company as part           of its imperial activities in India.  The purpose of the project is to          find out why politicians and bureaucrats perceived a need for more              accurate and more comprehensive maps than were hitherto available, and          why they accepted the great expense that such maps entailed.  The               project will have significance for reshaping our understanding of               cartography as not merely an exact and scientific profession concerned          with the accurate and truthful depiction of geographic reality, but as          an enterprise that is an important part of social and political                 process.",
