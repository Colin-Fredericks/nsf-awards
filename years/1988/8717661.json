 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of U.S. scientists in                 a seminar on the \"Development of a Unified Perspective on the                   Organization of Communities and Ecosystems,\" organized jointly                  by Dr. Donald DeAngelis of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory                    and Professor Ei Teramoto of Kyoto University, Japan.  United                   States and Japanese participants will meet in Honolulu, Hawaii                  during April 1988.  The seminar will provide a forum for                        detailed discussion on the factors which determine the                          structure and dynamics of ecosystems.  The theme of the                         workshop will revolve around two general questions.  Are there                  regularities in food web structure and, if so, do these                         regularities reflect constraints related to dynamic stability,                  energy, or other factors on the ecosystem?  How do ecosystem                    properties and the characteristics of individual species change                 during succession and evolution?                                                                                                                                There is considerable disagreement among theoretical ecologists                 as to what factors are most important in the shaping of food                    webs.  Japanese theoretical ecologists have developed an                        impressive body of mathematical theory for ecological networks                  that will facilitate the testing of alternative hypotheses                      related to ecosystem structure.  Becuase much of this                           information is little known in the United States, the seminar                   will provide an excellent opportunity for an integration of the                 work going on in our two countries.",
