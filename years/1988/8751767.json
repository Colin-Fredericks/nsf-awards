 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, Regional Educators Network and Enhancement Workshop               (RENEW) builds on the strengths of an honors workshop,(ASSIST) A Special        Summer Institute for Science Teachers funded by NSF. Twenty-five                teachers per year, from high school, middle school and elementary               schools respectively, will participate in an eight-week summer                  Enhancement Workshop at the University of Michigan Biological Station.          This Workshop will emphasize techniques in science education, peer              coaching, mentor-teaching and other effective strategies to enhance             their science teaching.  In addition, each teacher will choose one of           the regularly offered courses at the Biological Station to update and           enhance their biology content background.                                                                                                                       Project ASSIST participants will work with these teachers in their              schools during the school year.  In years two and three of this project,        a network of participants and previous participants will work in each of        five local regions in the state of Michigan to implement improved               science teaching, to communicate with each other and to disseminate             information to colleagues in their regions.  State funds have been              utilized in initiating a pilot version of this network.                                                                                                         Thirty-two percent of the budget for this project is cost-shared by             contributions from the University and school districts.  The cost of            released time, substitutes and materials to implement the program is            borne by the schools.  State of Michigan funds are being used to support        the \"veteran\" teachers in their support of participants.",
