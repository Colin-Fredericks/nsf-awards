 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research aims to develop a simulation testbed to study performance         issues of distributed algorithms in a comprehensive manner.  A number           of distributed algorithms have been designed to solve some of the               central problems of distributed computing like exclusion,                       synchronization, and deadlock detection.  However, little effort has            been devoted to studies that attempt to predict the performance of              these algorithms under different operating conditions.  The research            will identify a common set of performance metrics and the primary               factors that affect performance of different algorithms.  Based on the          above metrics, the simulation testbed will be used to achieve two               objectives:  for given problem (example, synchronization) and operating         conditions (example, fully connected network topology) identify \"best\"          available algorithm; use the performance results to develop a                   hypothesis to express the complexity of distributed algorithms and to           quantitatively compare different algorithms for a given problem.  The           study will focus on a set of problems, which have been solved by using          different combinations and extensions of known algorithms.  Performance         models will be developed using a modular, \"building block\" approach to          exploit the commonality in the solution of these problems.",
