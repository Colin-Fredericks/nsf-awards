 "awd_abstract_narration": "A gas chromatograph and high-pressure liquid chromatograph are                  improving laboratory instruction in  Analytical Chemistry,                      Biochemistry, Organic Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, Chemistry for Non-         Science Majors, General Chemistry and Advanced Laboratory Courses as            well as Undergraduate Research.  The acquisition of GC and HPLC                 instruments is enhancing student understanding of a) the fundamentals           of chromatographic science; b) the utilization of GC and HPLC for               qualitative and quantitative analysis of chemical systems; c) the               utilization of GC and HPLC for investigating reaction mechanisms; and           d) the utilization of GC and HPLC for separation and purification of            chemical compounds.                                                                                                                                             As GC and HPLC instruments are found in most governmental, industrial           and academic laboratories, the introduction of GC and HPLC into the             undergraduate chemistry program is better preparing the students for            future employment in the chemical profession.  Also the use of GC and           HPLC instruments in introductory courses for non-science majors is              acquainting these students with the use of one of the major principles          and methods in chemistry.
