 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fronts or near-discontinuities in wind and temperature                     frequently exist near the jet streams in the upper troposphre.                  It is well know that the vertical circulation around these                      fronts play a role in the development of midlatitude cyclones                   and precipitation systems; however, the dynamic link is not                     fully understood.  Because the horizontal and vertical scales of                an upper-level front, 100 km and 1 km respectively, are smaller                 than the average spacing of the radiosonde stations, it has                     always been difficult to extract much information on the frontal                circulation from the radiosonde network.  Also because the                      forces near a front are not in geostrophic balance, simple                      models cannot address nonlinear complexity, and primitive                       equation model simulations make the understanding of dynamics                   difficult.                                                                                                                                                           Under this grant Professor Keyser will apply a hierarchy of                approximated diagnostic models to the study of frontal                          circulations, the levels of approximation being                                 quasi-geostrophic, geostrophic momentum, and balance;                           simulations from primitive equation models will be treated as                   the limiting form of the approximated models.  The results from                 this work should reveal the characteristics of the upper-level                  frontal dynamics as well as its link to the development of                      cyclones in lower troposphere.",
