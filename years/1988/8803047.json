 "awd_abstract_narration": "A novel technique for the production of uniform, ultrafine (~100A),             dense, monodispersed superconducting ceramics is proposed in this               expedited award.  This method exploits the ability of single                    compartment vesicles to form a highly selective barrier between its             exterior and interior, thus creating a microvolume reactor in the               intravesicular space.  By appropriate processing, coprecipitation of            the mixed metal hydroxides (precursors of the superconducting,                  ceramics) can be induced in the internal region of these vesicles               only.  A mixed metal chloride solution consisting of precalculated              ratios of Cu++, Cu+, Ba++, and Y+++ ions along with ~1% w/w                     dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine will be sonicated at slightly above             the lipid gel-liquid phase transition temperature to encapsulate some           of the metal and chloride ions inside the unilamellar vesicles.                                                                                                 This proposal represents the first attempt at using single compartment          vesicles for coprecipitation of metal hydroxides which are precursors           for the recently discovered high temperature superconducting ceramics.          The critical transition temperature as well as the critical magnetic            field strength are intimately related to the stoichiometry and                  composition of the ceramic phase.  These can be varied easily in the            proposed technique by changing the ratio of the cations in the                  original solution.  In contrast, however, the critical current density          depends upon the processing steps used to obtain the final product.             By producing ultrafine, dense and uniform particles, it is expected             that higher critical current density than the presently available               sintered superconducting ceramics will be obtained.",
