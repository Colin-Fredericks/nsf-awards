 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Wood is supported by the Physical Chemistry                      Program to study the properties of aqueous solutions at                         temperatures up to 450 degrees C.  These measurements require                   the development of special instruments that can make                            thermodynamic measurements at such extreme tempertures.  Data                   will be obtained on the densities, heat capacities, heats of                    dilution, and electrical conductivities for a variety of                        aqueous solutions near the critical point of water.  Since some                 very abrupt changes in these properties occur, it is expected                   that these measurements will help develop theories for                          understanding these unusual effects.                                                                                                                                 This experimental research program is providing important                  thermochemical data to many fields, beyond chemistry.  In                       particular the data to be obtained by Professor Wood is                         expected to be of appreciable importance to geologists,                         steam-power and chemical engineers.  Such data are helpful to                   the understanding of mineral geochemistry, corrosion of                         electric plant boilers, and the chemistry involved in the                       production of geothermal power.  Also, these measurements are                   essential if one is to learn about the effects of solutes at                    low concentration and will be useful to test modern theory.",
