 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research project is to investigate the use                of polyvinylidene flouride (PVF) (a piezoelectric polymer film)                 as the actuator for a viscous fluid pump.  This material                        undergoes deformation due to an applied voltage.  Using this                    effect, a pump constriction could be generated by applying a                    voltage to the film causing it to expand its thickness while                    decreasing its length and width.                                                                                                                                This method of pumping viscous fluids has merit because of its                  overall simplicity.  There are significant problem areas to be                  investigated:  (1) the joining to form a ring is complex,                       metallization on the surface and the PVF material on the interior               are required to be connected, (2) the characteristics of                        deformation of the material as a flat material as compared to a                 ring; the problems associated with a produced magnetic field and                with electrical interference, and (3) a method of applying                      sequential voltage.                                                                                                                                             The pump would be relatively inexpensive, have no moving parts                  and would not churn or contact the flow.  It would be                           biologically inert allowing insertion into a living organism.                   This type of pump could prove useful in biomedical applications",
