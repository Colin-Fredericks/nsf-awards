The conference will include scientists from              several European countries, Australia and Japan.  Topics to be covered          will include modelling and monitoring of pollution from combinations of         small, dispersed and large industrial sources, impact of future growth          in the use of alternative energy sources, and improved efficiency of            combustion on air pollution in the tropics, characterization of                 tropical boundary layer over land and ocean, and procedures for dealing         with accidental releases of substantial quantities of toxic material in         densly populated areas.  The proceedings will be published by the               International Journal of Atmospheric Environment (published in the U.K.         and printed in India).                                                                                                                                          Scope:  The conference is sponsored by the American Meteorological              Society, the Third World Academy of Sciences, Trieste, Italy, the               Indian Department of Science and Technology, the Indian Science                 Academy, and the Indian Meteorological Society.  The U.S. P.I. is a             leading researcher on Indian atmospheric dynamics in collaboration with         the Indian organizer of the conference.  It is likely that the meeting          will stimulate further collaborative research, as well as provide               guidelines on dealing with atmospheric pollutants.",
