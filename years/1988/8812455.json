 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mechanism by which the eye generates nerve impulses in                      response to light, the process known as visual transduction, is                 incompletely understood although obviously important and                        scientifically interesting.  This project is intended to improve                our understanding of the process.                                                                                                                               The fruit fly, Drosophila, has long been used as research                       material because of its small number of chromosomes and their                   unique property of having easily visible structural details                     during certain phases of the insect's life.  There are now many                 mutant strains available, a number of which have visual defects                 that probably include defects in their ability to perform the                   sequence of events that comprisevisual transduction.  Such                      mutants will be exploited in this project in an effort to do a                  molecular genetic \"dissection\" of the process.                                                                                                                  The basic experimental method will be to record electrical events               (precursory to and secondary to nerve impulses) from cells of the               eyes of mutant flies while exposing the cells to various                        pharmacological agents and compounds that are believed to be                    produced at various steps in transduction.  In this way it will                 be possible to define the steps better and clarify the overall                  process.  It will also precisely define the defects in the                      mutants, thereby rendering them more useful in other studies of                 genetic aspects of the problem.",
