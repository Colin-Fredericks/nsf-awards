 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major goal of this research proposal is to generate new                information on the biogenesis of a plant peroxisome, the                        glyoxysome, which is pivotally involved in storage lipid                        metabolism during the critical heterotrophic growth phase of                    economically - important oilseeds.  The main emphasis is on                     deciphering the mechanisms responsible for targeting and                        importing membrane phospholipids and enzyme proteins into                       glyoxysomes in maturing and germinated cotton seeds.                            Understanding organelle biogenesis (integral to intracellular                   compartmentation) is an essential part of ultimately                            comprehending the complexities of cellular metabolism.                                                                                                               Formation of glyoxysomes will be analyzed by electron                      microscopy coupled with immunocytochemistry of enzymes to                       visualize images in thin sections of developing cotyledons.                     Phospholipid composition of organelle membranes will be                         quantitated by Iatrascan TLC/FID, and the subcellular site of                   phospholipid synthesizing enzymes will be determined from                       radioactive labeling assays of fractions prepared by density -                  gradient centrifugation.  In vivo (protoplasts) and in vitro                    (translation products from Poly A+ mRNA) systems will be                        established to experimentally evaluate critical requirements for                import of isocitrate lyase, catalase, and malate synthase into                  peroxisomes isolated from cotton and other species.  Recombinant                DNA experiments will be initiated wherein a lambda gt10 library                 will be sequenced and those with full length open reading frames                will be subcloned into vectors for establishing an in vitro                     transcription/translation system designed to assess molecular                   modifications on the import of proteins.  The timing and                        appearance of gene transcripts in maturing seeds will be                        determined with cloned DNA probes to document apparent                          translation control(s) of enzyme synthesis in maturing seeds.***",
