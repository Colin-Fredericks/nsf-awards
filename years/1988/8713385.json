 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Dr. Kenneth Paigen and one of his colleagues,            both from the University of California, Berkeley, to collaborate                with Drs. Kurt Pfister and Richard Gitzelmann, University Children's            Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland.  They will study the genetic                     regulatory system of the B-glucuronidase gene in mice.  Three                   classes of regulatory mutations involving the gene have been                    described:  (1) systemic mutations that change enzyme levels in all             cells, (2) temporal mutations that change the appearance of the                 enzyme during development of certain tissues, and (3) hormone-                  response mutations that change the ability of the B-glucuronidase               gene to be activated by androgens.  The proposed research will be               concerned with the effects of the mutations in cell culture systems.                                                                                            The research is expected to lead to further knowledge of the                    regulation of B-glucuronidase gene expression and of the mechanisms             of gene expression in general.  It may also ultimately contribute to            a better understanding of a particular genetic disorder associated              with the lack of this gene's expression.  Of more general interest              are the expected benefits to be derived from the definition and                 better understanding of the regulatory steps and mechanisms from                mRNA translation to final protein localization and action.  The                 research will benefit from the international collaboration because              Dr. Paigen's laboratory is expert in dealing with the genetics and              molecular biology of the B-glucuronidase system, and the Swiss                  laboratory is experienced in applying techniques of cell culture and            protein biochemistry to questions of B-glucuronidase regulation.                The two laboratories have a successful history of collaboration, and            this award will support the international travel necessary for the              U.S. group to continue its part of the joint effort.",
