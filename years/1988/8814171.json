The previous workshops in this                       series were held in Europe.  The workshops have been the                        primary vehicle for gathering together the physicists working                   on proton-antiproton collision at high energy.  In the past,                    the workshops have been dominated by experiments from Europe.                   This year the Tevatron at Fermilab will have completed its                      first major run.  NSF funds would be used to defray costs for                   publications, particularly for young physicists who were not                    obliged to pay a registration fee.",
