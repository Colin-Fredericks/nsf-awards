 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this research are to establish the                       dependence of surface characteristics on structural                             characteristics of synthetic allophane and imogolite, determine                 the thermodynamic stability (metastability) of allophane and                    imogolite and to initiate investigations comparing the surface                  and structural characteristics and stability of synthetic and                   naturally-occurring allophane and imogolite.  The coordination of               Al and the coordination environment of Si will be determined by                 MAS-NMR and bulk composition by dissolution and by                              energy-dispersive X-ray analysis.  Surface acidity and charge                   characteristics will be determined by potentiometric titration,                 ion retention, and electrophoresis.  Monovalent ions of the                     alkali and halide series will be used to test models of ion                     selectivity and large organic cations will be used to test a                    hypothesis that proposed unequal distribution of cations and ions               between surface and interior sites.  We will initiate a                         comparison of surface and bulk characteristics between the                      synthetic materials and their counterparts isolated from soils                  and pumice deposits.  Stability determinations on all materials                 will be based on solubility experiments.                                                  Allophane and imogolite are noncrystalline                            aluminosilicates which occur in a variety of soils.  They are                   interesting from a theoretical standpoint because they exhibit a                wide range of composition while maintaining some consistent and                 unique structural characteristics.   From a practical standpoint,               their very high specific surface areas impart an influence on                   soil properties in excess to what is expected from their mass.                  They are known to influence water holding capacity, fertility,                  degradation or polymerization of organic compounds, and transport               of Al in soils.  Potential applications of this research may also               extend to addressing problems in waste disposal, and rain and                   pollution.",
