 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fluorescence microscope has become an essential tool in many           areas of research in the biological sciences.  The localization of a            variety of cellular structures using specific fluorescent markers or            immunofluorescence is essential to much of our current understanding of         such basic concepts as the cytoskeleton, cellular motility, and                 cellular transport phenomena.  The aim of this project is to integrate          fluorescence microscopy the into biological curriculum.  A state-of-            the-art microscope with capabilities for automatic photomicrography and         for phase-contrast, differential interference-contrast, and incident-           light fluorescence microscopy (in concert with video monitors and               cameras and with additional microscopes with appropriate capabilities)          is being used in the laboratories of several courses.                                                                                                           The major application is in a new course in Cellular Dynamics where             fluorescence microscopy enables undergraduates to investigate the               regulation of a variety of cytoskeleton-mediated events and receptor-           mediated endocytosis.  Additional applications are in the teaching              laboratories associated with courses in Animal Cells, Tissues, and              Organs, in Microbiology, Topics in Molecular Biology, and Genetics.             These applications make it possible for the faculty to stress the               integration of biological principles over a broad spectrum of courses.          Thus the project provides students with the unique opportunity to learn         many of the applications of fluorescence microscopy through                     experimentation in a variety of laboratories.                                                                                                                        The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
