 "awd_abstract_narration": "Americans have become increasingly concerned with the radiation                 they are exposed to in their daily lives.  In the 1940's and                    50's, x-rays were routinely used in dentistry, medical exams,                   even for the purchase of shoes|  Routine x-rays are now greatly                 restricted and at considerably less dose than previously accepted               standards.  The construction of homes over uranium mine tailings                in the West has enriched lawyers in the ongoing litigation.                     Radon seeping into the basements of homes, schools and offices                  from naturally occurring granite deposits in the East has caused                a whole new industry for testing of radiation levels.  Charges of               release of radiation from government facilities has brought                     congressional investigations.  This increased awareness of the                  hazards of exposure to radiation has come, in great part, because               of the changing standards of exposure which scientists have                     established over the years.  Dr.Whittemore, under this grant,                   will complete his study, started under an NSF dissertation                      support award, of the American response from the 1920's to 1970                 to radiation hazards, particularly the establishment and later                  alterations of radiation exposure standards.  This study is not                 an attempt to impose contemporary policy analysis but instead                   learn how, in actual practice, the scientific, political and                    ethical issues interacted.  This history of radiation standards                 in the United States from the founding of the Advisory Committee                on X-ray and Radiation Protection in 1928 to the disbanding of                  the Federal Radiation Council in 1970, when its functions were                  transferred to the Environmental Protection Agency.  The history                focuses on the establishment and revision of the most basic                     standards for allowable exposure:  \"tolerance dose,\"  \"maximum                  permissible exposure\" and \"radiation protection guidelines.\"                    Research is based primarily on the archives of the scientific                   committees which established and revised these standards:  the                  National Council on Radiation Protection (the modern name of the                ACXRP) and the Federal Radiation Council.  In addition to                       examining the interaction of scientific, political and ethical                  issues within each committee, the project will also provide the                 opportunity to compare the workings of an independent scientific                institution (the NCRP) with a federal agency (FRC).",
