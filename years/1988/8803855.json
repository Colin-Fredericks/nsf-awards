This project has the following                           specific aims:                                                                                                                                                  1.  To carry out the lipid analyses and labelling studies                           required to characterize arabidopsis mutants already                            selected.                                                                                                                                                   2.  To investigate the photosynthetic characteristics of                            those mutants in which the fatty acid compositions of                           chloroplast lipids are affected.                                                                                                                            3.  To construct double mutants with more extensive changes                         in chloroplast fatty acid composition and to study                              photosynthesis in these also.                                                                                                                               4.  To screen independent M2 populations for further mutants                        and alleles of existing mutants.                                                                                                                            Results so far obtained indicate that these mutants can                         provide considerable information on the enzymology of                           desaturation and on the control of cellular lipid metabolism.                   More importantly the mutants provide a means of directly                        addressing the question of how the fatty acid composition of                    thylakoid membranes affects chloroplast structure and                           function.%%%                                                                                                                                                    Increased knowledge in these areas is an essential                              prerequisite to intelligently manipulating membrane lipid                       composition by recombinant DNA techniques.  For example,                        because of the possible importance of membrane lipid                            composition in the temperature responses to plants, a                           detailed understanding of fatty acid desaturation and the                       genes which control this process may make it possible to                        genetically modify economically important crop species to                       better suit particular environmental conditions.***",
