 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will observe profoundly deaf children of hearing                   parents who have not exposed them to manual language (such as                   American Sign Language).  In previous work, the PI and her                      associates have found that despite such impoverished language-                  learning conditions, an American deaf child could develop a                     gestural communication system structured at the                                 word/morphological level.  The current project observes Chinese                 deaf children of hearing parents who also have not been exposed                 to any manual language to see whether they, too, develop a                      gesture system structured at the word level despite the different               cultural context.  A longitudinal comparison of ten American deaf               children and five Chinese deaf children in similar circumstances,               recorded on videotape and transcribed, will show whether the                    home-sign gestural systems developed by such children is similar                or whether it is affected by input from the hearing parents, who                in turn are affected by their different cultures and                            typologically different languages.",
