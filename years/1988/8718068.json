 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Mark Morris, at the University of California, Los Angeles,                  will carry out observational research on the nucleus of our Galaxy              at radio wavelengths.  During several years of observing with the               Very Large Array, the PI and his colleagues have gathered a very                extensive body of data on the Galactic Center, and they have made               several discoveries which highlight the importance of strong                    magnetic fields in the inner regions of the Galaxy.  Their current              research continues these studies with intensive computational work              to realize the full potential of the existing data base and with                new observations to clarify the physical processes responsible for              the unique observed phenomenology.                                                                                                                              The Galactic Center provides a close-up example of a moderately                 active galactic nucleus.  As such it can be expected to give us                 new insights into processes which also occur in the more active                 Seyfert and quasar phenomena.  With new instrumentation such as                 the Very Large Array and new data analysis capabilities such as                 image processing on supercomputers, we are able to study the                    structure of the center of our Galaxy in unprecedented detail.                  Dr. Morris has been a leader in refining our knowledge about the                Galactic Center.",
