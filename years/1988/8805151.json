 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            designed to increase the participation of minorities in scientific and          engineering research.  The program provides support to strengthen the           research environment and capabilities of institutions that have                 substantial minority student enrollments.  Eligible institutions must           also have graduate programs in science or programs in engineering.              The principal investigators at the University of Puerto Rico (Rio               Piedras) will use RIMI support to purchase equipment to upgrade                 facilities for recombinant DNA technology within the Department of              Biology.  Small equipment will be provided for equipping individual             laboratories while major equipment items will be designated for shared          access.  These latter acquisitions will result in upgrading self                contained facilities which include a dark room, a four-degree                   centigrade cold room and units employed for DNA sequencing radio                immunoassey and chromatography.                                                                                                                                 This support will facilitate ongoing studies in which recombinant DNA           methodologies such as the preparation of gene librarea, cloning,                hybridization techniques and DNA sequencing are being employed to               study mechanisms of gene expression in a wide range of species,                 including spiders, sea urchins, lizards, birds, yeast and protozoa.             These studies address such fundamental problems as the identification           and characterization of regulatory genes, the role of small RNA                 molecules in their interaction with regulatory genes and the role of            the DNA in the decoding process.  The survival potential of                     genetically engineered bacteria is yet the subject of another study.                                                                                            This project will clearly meet the objectives of the RIMI program in            several ways.  It will significantly strengthen the scientific                  research infrastructure, provide an opportunity for an isolated                 population of minority students to become well-educated in modern               biotechnology and serve to promote cooperative research projects with           other institutions including industrial and government laboratories.                                                                                            The principal investigator is an experienced and active minority                researcher.   She has excellent qualifications for overseeing the               development and management of these new facilities as well as to guide          and assist young investigators in the application of this technology            to their own research.  This RIMI project will encourage more minority          students to consider research careers in science and engineering.",
