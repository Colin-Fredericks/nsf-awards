 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will focus on the distribution of ion channels in                 skeletal muscle and the mechanisms for creating and maintaining                 these channel distributions.  The distribution and single channel               properties of voltage-gated sodium channels will be studied with                loose patch and tight patch voltage clamp.  A new technique which               combines both patch voltage clamp and ionophoresis will be used                 to find the degree of colocalization of sodium channels and                     acetylcholine receptors.  Different distributions of sodium                     channels in fast and slow muscle may suggest functional roles for               these channel distributions.  Potassium channel and choride                     channel distributions will be studied with the same techniques                  since there is evidence that these too are nonuniformly                         distributed in muscle.  The pertinence of extending these studies               to other channels is that the channels are not regulated in                     unison either spatially or in response to perturbations.  Thus it               may be possible to identify both general and specific regulatory                controls.  Extracellular factors that may regulate channel                      distribution or immobilization will be tested.",
