 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Biological Research Station of the Edmund Niles Huyck                  Preserve on the Helderberg Plateau in Rensselaerville, N.Y., has                been in existence since 1938.  Since then some 155 researchers                  have conducted over 225 projects and published 170 papers.  An                  historical data base has been developed on the geology,                         hydrology, climate, and biota.  Current research programs focus                 on the biology of forest floor biota and the decomposer food web,               forest succession, and behavioral ecology and evolution.                        Research has now moved beyond the simple cataloguing of species                 and equipment (e.g. microscopes, drying oven, autoclave, balance)               is needed by most researchers that use the Preserve to answer the               in-depth questions being posed today.  Much of the research asks                questions about factors that affect the occurrence of organisms                 and data must be available on weather which can affect biotic                   distributions.  This project provides funds to help upgrade the                 facilities of the Research Station through the addition of needed               research equipment and weather stations, and the winterization of               the main researcher living quarters.",
