 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of the copper-thiourea system.  Both electrodeposition          and electrodissolution of copper are influenced by the addition of              thiourea.  This investigation uses standard electrochemical techniques          such as voltammetry in addition to exploring the use of alternating-            current impedance as a quantitative method to measure the adsorption            kinetics of thiourea on copper.  A rotating disk electrode is used in           all experiments to distinguish between kinetic and mass-transfer                effects.  Fourier-transform infrared reflection spectroscopy provides           an in situ characterization of species at the electrode-solution                interphase.  Mathematical analysis of the application of AC impedance           to adsorption kinetics and complicated electrochemical processes                involving adsorption is done concurrently with the experimental                 studies.                                                                                                                                                        Many electrochemical processes depend on the ability of organic                 molecules to adsorb on the electrode surface.  This is a study of               adsorption kinetics designed to improve understanding of adsorption             mechanisms and the effects of adsorption on industrially important              electrochemical processes.  Thiourea is chosen as the model compound            because it is used both to inhibit corrosion of copper and to enhance           electroplating of copper.",
