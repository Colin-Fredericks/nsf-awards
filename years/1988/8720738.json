 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kraft will observe and analyze spectra of about a dozen giant                   stars in each of six globular clusters.  The goal is a better                   determination of the oxygen abundance in these stars.  The                      observations have become possible with the advent of the Hamilton               spectrograph at the 3-meter telescope of Lick Observatory.  Most                of the award supports a named graduate student.                                                                                                                 Globular star clusters were formed at the time when our Galaxy was              formed.  Their observation can inform us of the elements present                at that time and the formation of the elements since then by stars              in our Galaxy.  Oxygen is one of the elements made in stars and an              element that is most important both for the evolution of aging                  stars and for chemistry everywhere.  For the first time, new                    observational facilities permit a reliable measurement of the                   oxygen abundance in giant stars within globular star clusters.                  Kraft and a graduate student will obtain such measurements and                  evaluate the oxygen abundances for stars in six globular star                   clusters.",
