 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years interactive computer technology has                        significantly expanded the possibilities for users to control                   interfaces to group systems through individual or group                         modifications.  Adapting the interface to individual work styles                potentially enhances the ability of information workers to exploit              more fully their substantive expertise and to enhance their job                 performance.  However, user modifiability options have not been                 widely implemented, in part because of fears about impacts on                   organization.wide system integrity and manageability.  This                     project conducts a controlled field experiment to study what                    happens to organizations, work groups, and individuals when users               are allowed to modify system interfaces.  About eight work groups               of 15.20 people in two or more organizations are studied over                   eight months as they use electronic mail.  Half the groups  have a              range of modification options; the others operate with                          unmodifiable systems.  Effects at individual and group levels are               studied using a combination of system.logged indicators,                        behavioral methods, and self reports.  Analysis focuses on short                and long.range performance effects, structural and communication                effects, and the tradeoffs observed among outcomes.  The study                  also characterizes the processes of implementation of                           modifiability options, and the diffusion of user.generated                      interface variations.  The result sought is a more systematic                   picture of how user modifiability affects the implementation and                use of information technology, as well as of the consequences for               individual, group and organizational performance.",
