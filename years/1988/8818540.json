In particular                          development of coal in lieu of coke as the reducing agent will                  be studied since this is important to India and the U.S.                                                                                                        Scope:  The U.S.-India Program seeks to foster scientific                       _____                                                                           collaboration in areas where both countries can benefit.  This                  case is a prime example.  These projects were developed jointly                 during and following an Indo-U.S. Workshop on Steel Research                    held in India in 1986.  The work will be carried mostly in                      India, especially large scale tests.  The U.S. team will do                     supplementary research on their current domestic projects.  This                activity is likely to produce significant scientific results.                                                                                                   Funding:  These projects are being funded under two grants:                                  INT-8818540 to CMU           INT-8818256 to SAIL                   FY88-US$70,000 + $51,360 (in Rs.)         $112,692 (in Rs.)
