During the summer of 1988 an intensive four week workshop will be held          for 30 teachers.  Ecology will be used as the means of exploring the            scientific method and each teacher will be required to develop a                curricular unit.  During the academic year the units will be completed          and field-tested.  The best units and teachers will be selected to              create a summer science academy for students the following summer.                                                                                              During the summer of 1989 a second workshop based on the previous summer        will be offered to 15 additional teachers.  It will be run concurrently         with a science academy for 30 to 45 middle school students taught by            teacher participants from the previous summer.  During the academic year        fifteen additional units will be completed and tested.  The best units          will be incorporated into the curriculum of the next summer program.                                                                                            This project has a number of features which justify its funding as a            Teacher Enhancement Project.  The following are the more significant:                                                                                           1.The projects will attempt to update the background                            material and teaching strategies through the                                    involvement in the informal atmosphere of an                                    arboretum;                                                                                                                                                      2.A program will be developed to encourage promising                            students to be involved in science activities during                            the summer;                                                                                                                                                     3.Information will be supplied with respect to the                              success of outdoor field activities in modifying on                             the curriculum of the middle schools; and                                                                                                                       4.If successful, the project can be a model for other                           locations.",
