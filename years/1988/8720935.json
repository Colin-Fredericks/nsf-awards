 "awd_abstract_narration": "What controls earthquake size and occurrence?  Scientists and              non-scientists alike have pondered this question for a longtime.                Earthquakes are a complex and wonderous natural phenomenon that                 unfortunately can also cause great human catastrophes; the hazards              range from near-source ground shaking to tsunamis that can strike               from across the Pacific Ocean.  Plate tectonics provides the                    framework to explain plate boundary earthquakes as a direct                     consequence of the plate boundaries, what controls exactly                      wherean earthquake will occur; how large it will be; and when it                will happen?  To answer these questions, seismologists must look                closer at the plate interface zone.  In fact, it is necessary to                \"look inside\" the earthquake rupture areas.  Heuristic arguments                (plus some direct observations) clearly indicate that the                       processes and properties of plate interface zones cannot be                     spatially homogeneous - spatial heterogeneity is required to                    explain seismicity.  A first-order categorization of fault zone                 heterogeneity is the simple binary classification of                            strong/weak.The strong regions are \"stuck\" and accumulate the                   tectonic strain, to be finally released by rupture in large                     earthquakes. We call these strong regions asperities.  One of the               excitingrecent developments in earthquake seismology is that we                 are now moving from the mere acceptance of spatial heterogeneity                to actually mapping the first-order representation of this                      heterogeneity along plate boundary segments.",
