 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase II award is for the integration of optical CAM             system parameters directly into an optical CAD system.  The                     importance of the integration concept will be demonstrated by the               design and manufacture of a sample optical system.  With CAM systems            emerging, it is important to be able to represent directly in the               optical design program the families of surfaces which can be                    manufactured using CAM technology.  This allows the optical design              engineer the freedom to use aspheric surfaces with the confidence               that the resulting design can be manufactured.  Mathematical models             will be included directly into a commercial optical design program              which will then be used to study tolerance of some typical optical              systems directly in terms of CAM process parameters.  The                       implications of successful completion of this research are far-                 reaching in simplification of optical system designs, increased                 reliability, and reduced optical production costs.",
