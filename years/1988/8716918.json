 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cloud and aerosol formation in the atmosphere are                          initiated by heterogeneous nucleation and condensation                          processes on foreign particles.  Cloud droplets and aerosols                    thus formed are subject to further growth by coalescence.                       Foreign particles in the atmosphere enhance nucleation with                     varying degrees of efficiency.  An understanding of this                        heterogeneous nucleation requires basic (microphysical and                      chemical) knowledge, e.g., about the interactions between vapor                 phase molecules and the surface of the foreign particle,                        surface diffusion, and gas-to-particle conversion.                              Heterogeneous nucleation in the atmosphere encompasses numerous                 particulate systems involving ions, organic and inorganic                       species, bacteria, cloud condensation nuclei, and other pre-                    existing aerosols.                                                                   There is a paucity of basic understanding of the                           mechanisms leading to gas-to-particle conversion in the                         atmosphere, particularly heterogeneous nucleation mechanisms.                   The main objective of proposed research is to study the                         embryonic stage.  While classical approaches use bulk                           (macroscopic) parameters for the microphysical phenomena of                     heterogeneous cluster formation and growth, this work will us                   an approach based on molecular level descriptions.  The                         specific goals of the proposed research are:  1) to find micro-                 physical and micro-chemical means of computing heterogeneous                    nucleation rates involving various foreign particles (e.g.,                     ions, cloud condensation nuclei and organic particles), and                     differences in nucleation rates between different foreign                       particle species; 2) to reveal microphysical and chemical                       properties of heterogeneous clusters, in particular their                       stability, interaction, and energetics at varying temperature                   and humidity.  This work will benefit cloud modeling for                        meteorology, lead to better understanding of cloud and aerosol                  formation processes as well as those of smog, dust, and haze,                   and stimulate experiments associated with droplet formation,                    sticking coefficients, and free energy changes.",
