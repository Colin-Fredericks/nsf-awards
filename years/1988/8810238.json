 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is a renewal for research by Professor John                     Cowley on the use of high resolution electron microscopy for the                investigation of the structure of defects and surfaces of ceramic               and electronic materials.  The current research concentrates on                 a range of new techniques and the further advancement of                        established techniques for the more detailed atomic description                 of the structures and chemical compositions of crystal surfaces                 and atomic disorder in thin films and small particles.  The                     effects of surface resonance channelling, which confine the                     electron beam to the topmost lines or planes of atoms on crystal                surfaces will be investigated for the reflection electron                       microscope.  These effects are observed in the Kikuchi line                     patterns in reflection high energy electron diffraction, and                    they provide for the basis for the technique developed by this                  group called electron energy loss spectroscopy.  These new                      techniques allow micro-chemical and atomic analysis of surface                  monolayers.  These techniques are being applied to studies of                   surfaces of oxide ceramics (e.g. magnesium oxide) and                           semiconductors (e.g. silicon and gallium arsenide).  Two new                    ultra high vacuum high resolution electron microscopes are to be                used for this study.                                                                                                                                                 The research of Professor Cowley has been at the leading                   edge of high resolution electron microscopy for years.  It has                  led to several of the techniques in use worldwide today.  The                   present research will continue to advance these techniques, and                 their use in characterization of ceramics and electronic                        materials on the atomic scale.  This group at Arizona State                     University continues to train graduate students and post doctoral               students in the use of these advanced analytical techniques.",
