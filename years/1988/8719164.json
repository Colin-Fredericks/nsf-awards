 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports Dr. Johnson for                             research work on rhesus monkeys, with an Indian scientist,                      Dr. (Mrs.) Iqbal Malik, Institute of Home Economics,                            University of Delhi, India.  They plan to study the                             maternal investment behavior and seek to identify the                           ecological and social factors, producing variability in the                     length and frequency of the infants' nursing bouts.                             Special attention will be paid to two factors; maternal                         time budgets and the availability of solid foods accessible                     to young infants.  The current prediction is that mothers                       who allow infants to nurse more often or longer bouts delay                     the reproduction cycle and thus permit these youngsters to                      grow relatively older by the time they are weened.  This is                     based on the assumption, known for human mothers, that                          their is a strong correlation between frequent nursing                          bouts of short duration and a prolonged lactational                             infertility.  The research will be carried over two birth                       seasons by observing the rhesus monkeys within a natural                        free-ranging population in India.                                                                                                                               Scope:  The two scientists have collaborated in the past on                     research in this field.  The proposed work is timely and is                     likely to produce valuable results given the experience of                      the two collaborators in the field and their past record of                     publications.  The research plan includes ecological and                        social influences on reproduction of primates and has                           important applications in wildlife management and in human                      reproductive behavior.",
