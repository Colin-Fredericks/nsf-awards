 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new undergraduate program in civil engineering systems (CES) has been         instituted as a means of equipping the civil engineering student to             deal with the broader aspects of the profession.  The CES program               emphasizes the complex nature of civil engineering problems.  This              project completes the curriculum development with a new course in               Structural Systems and the integration of computer-aided design (CAD)           concepts into the curriculum.  The objective of the course in                   structural systems is for the student to understand the                         structural/construction phase as a true system.  A new CAD course is an         integral part of the CES curriculum.  The CES curriculum is a                   significant departure from conventional civil engineering education,            but one which the engineer of the next century will need to understand.         Matching funds commited by the institution are more than three-fourths          of the amount of NSF funds for this project.",
