 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal, between Drs. Thomas G. Rawski and Gary H. Jefferson              of the University of Pittsburgh, and Professors WANG Hongchang ZHENG            Yuxin of the Institute of Quantitative and Technical Economics of               the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, focuses on productivity and             reform in China's industrial economy, critical factors in assessing             the success of China's economic reforms since 1978.                                                                                                             The investigators' initial analysis shows that multi-factor                     productivity in state industry, previously thought to have stagnated            in the mid 1950's, rose slowly before 1978 and accelerated sharply              during the post 1978 reforms.  Because aggregate results hide a wide            range of sectoral and regional performance, the investigators will              use newly available data to begin a detailed survey of sectoral and             regional productivity trends; to investigate compilation,                       aggregation and pricing problems; to pursue a production function               approach to specifying the technological properties of Chinese                  studies that might expand the variety of institutional arrangements             available for systematic empirical analysis.  They want to describe             the efficiency of various segments of Chinese industry; to identify             what determines unusual productivity; and eventually to use these               empirical results as a basis for examining policy alternatives and              institutional arrangements to improve industrial productivity and               efficiency.  This proposal is jointly sponsored by NSF and the                  Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.",
