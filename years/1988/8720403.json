 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is further the development and                evaluation of auditory models that can enhance the performance of               automatic speech recognition systems.  The research has two                     specific objectives.  The primary objective is to extend an                     auditory model developed by Weintraub (1986, 1985, 1984) to                     incorporate acoustic information sources (e.g. both periodicity                 and spectral information) that can be used to separate targeted                 speech from unwanted sounds, including other speech.  The                       additional acoustic information should result in a significant                  improvement of performance when abstracting speech from a                       background of noise.                                                                                                                                                 A Second objective is to develop a new methodology for                     evaluating a range of signal-processing algorithms, including                   auditory modeling.  This method is based on an information-                     theoretic approach that follows the ideal-observer concept.  With               this method, the information actually extracted by a signal-                    processing algorithm can be compared with the information                       potentially available in the signal, to obtain a measure of the                 performance for each algorithm.  The project plans to implement                 several well-known signal processing algorithms for dealing with                speech in noise.  The result of the of this research allow us to                evaluate modifications to the auditory model and compare the                    performance achieved to that of other signal processing                         algorithms.",
