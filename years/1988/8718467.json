 "awd_abstract_narration": "Individuals' cognitive strategies for controlling anxiety,                      monitoring progress towards goals, and protecting self-esteem                   have been implicated as important to personality adjustment in                  many arenas of social life.  A strategy of defensive pessimism--                characterized by a great deal of cognitive effort at \"playing                   through\" events before they occur and preparing for low-                        probability \"worst-case outcomes\" -- provides an interesting                    contrast with strategic optimism in which the best is assumed                   until proven otherwise, and self-esteem is protected only when                  necessary after the fact.  Both strategies tend to ensure                       successful achievement, though in very different ways, and with                 different consequences for daily life stress and health                         symptomalogy, social relationships, and personal satisfaction and               motivation.  The present  work will investigate the self-                       regulatory processes underlying these strategies, as well as the                associated costs and benefits for personality functioning across                different life situations and over time; utilizing a variety of                 techniques including daily diaries, experience-sampling methods,                family interviews, and experimental studies of task choice and                  persistence at tasks.  Comparisons with other common strategic                  approaches to personally-risky situations (e.g., self-                          handicapping) will be made, and the relative costs and benefits                 of these strategies will be assessed across a range of college                  and non-college student populations and environments.  The                      investigators assume that individuals can shift their strategies                to fit the special demands of a changing environment, and                       analyses over time and in different life environments will test                 this basic premise of personality mutability.                                                                                                                   The Principal Investigator is well-known as a highly productive                 scholar.",
