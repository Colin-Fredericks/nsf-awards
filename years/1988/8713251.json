 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past five years much progress has been made in elucidating           the molecular basis of the immune response.  The organization of                genes encoding the specficity of the antigen receptor of B and T                cells, as  well as of genes encoding various lymphokines, was                   unravelled.  Moreover the rearrangement of genes encoding lymphocytic           receptor  during the development of lymphocytes was demonstrated to             be a unique and particular molecular event characteristic for                   lymphoid lineage.  Important progress also occurred in understanding            the organization of genes of the MHC locus, whose products function             as genetic restriction elements that control the magnitude and                  affinity of antibody responses. The knowledge obtained from these               fundamental studies has been extended to diseases and contributed to            the understanding, function and the characteristics of V genes                  encoding antibodies and the role of MHC products in autoimmune                  diseases.  The Conference on the Molecular Basis of the Immune                  Response, organized by Dr. Bona for the New York Academy of Sciences            will review some of these advances as well as provide new insight on            the function of lymphocytes in physiological and pathological                   conditions.",
