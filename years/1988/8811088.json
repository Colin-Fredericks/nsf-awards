The secretary will work closely on                   the latter program with the Intergovernmental TOGA Board (ITB)                  of the World Meterorological Organization (WMO) and the                         international Scientific Steering Group for TOGA (SSG/TOGA).                                                                                                            The secretary will organize and arrange for meetings of the             CCCO and its subsidiary bodies; prepare advance documentation                   for these meetings; compile reports and other results of these                  meetings and assure their wide dissemination to the global                      ocean science community; provide other staff assistance as                      needed for program planning; and serve as the CCCO's primary                    staff liaison with the WMO and Unesco's Intergovernmental                       Oceanographic Commission (IOC) to assure appropriate                            intergovernmental funding and related support for CCCO planning                 activities.",
