 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is in the general area of the so-called                      Langlands Program, a subject that lies on the bridge between                    Number Theory and Representation Theory in Modern Analysis.  More               specifically one attaches an L-function to a cuspidal automorphic               representation of the group of two by two matrices over the                     rational adele ring, and one also attaches an L-function to an                  irreducible representation of the galois group of the algebraic                 closure of the rational numbers.  The main question to be                       investigated on this project is when these two L-function                       coincide.  A new method has been devised to answer this question                and this method will be pursued.                                                     Two different types of functions that contain a great deal                 of number theoretic information will be investigated.  When they                can be shown to coincide one can obtain much important arithmetic               information about the more obscure one from the better understood               one.  Producing these formulas is the focus of this research.",
