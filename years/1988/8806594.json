 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators plan a systematic program of spectroscopy and                 photometry of O, B, and WR (Wolf-Rayet) stars in the Magellanic                 Cloud.  The goal is to identify, classify, and analyze the spectra              of these hot stars to determine their numbers, luminosities,                    effective temperatures, and other stellar parameters.  The results              will inform us about the evolution of such hot stars and help make              correct interpretations of distant galaxies where individual stars              are not resolved.  Selected observations will extend this                       investigation to other galaxies of the Local Group.                                                                                                             The hottest stars in our Galaxy are important because their                     formation and their astronomically almost immediate violent deaths              stir up our Galaxy, facilitate formation of ordinary stars like                 the Sun, and contribute heavy elements that are later used in                   other stars and in planets.  Very hot stars are also among the                  brightest signposts expected to be useful for understanding                     distant galaxies, but it is not yet known whether those stars are               really the same in distant galaxies and in our Galaxy.  Conti and               Garmany are exploring the very hot stars in the nearest galaxies,               specifically in the Magellanic Clouds, both to learn more about                 such stars and to help interpret observations of distant galaxies.              They will use a new and very efficient spectrograph at the Cerro                Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.",
