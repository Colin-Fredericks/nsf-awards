 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dynamic capabilities of RNA have been fully realized with                   the discovery that RNA molecules can perform as catalysts in                    secondary reactions of the central dogma.  The endonucleolytic                  activity of RNase P RNA on its substrate, precursor tRNA, was                   the second such activity to be described.   It is proposed to                   continue the investigation on the structure of RNase P in order                 to further define the mechanism of catalysis and the                            intracellular structure of RNase P.  Further it is proposed to                  extend the  understanding of the phylogenetics of this RNA                      catalyst as well as to begin a search for other physiologically                 important small RNAs.  The structural analysis of RNase P RNA                   will make use of comparative sequencing of RNase P RNAs from                    several microorganisms as well as chemical and enzymatic probes                 of structure at various temperatures and ionic conditions.                      The phylogenetics of RNase P will be explored by examining                      Deinococcus radiodurans, Micrococcus roseus, Clostridium                        sporogenes, Halobacter solanarium, and Thermoplasma acidophilum                 using a synthetic precursor tRNA as substrate.  The                             intracellular conformation of the RNase P will be examined by                   the isolation of the activity under conditions that preserve                    macromolecular interactions and, alternatively, by asking what                  proteins bind to purified RNase P RNA.  Other small RNAs                        isolated will be tested for evolutionary conservation (hence                    physiological importance).                                                                                                                                      RNA has recently been found to catalyze certain reactions in                    its own maturation process.  This is contrary to the previously                 held concept that only proteins could serve as catalysts                        (enzymes).  It also leads to the obvious possibility that RNA                   molecules were the first self-replicating units of life.  This                  proposal is to investigate the structure of these RNA particles                 and to determine whether they are present in the most ancient                   forms of life still present on the planet, the archaeacteria.",
