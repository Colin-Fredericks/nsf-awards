 "awd_abstract_narration": "Direct observation and assessment of family members'                            interactions with one another is being increasingly recognized                  as an important method for empirically investigating the social                 context of individual development.  Longitudinal analyses of                    observational data and its relation to individual development,                  however, are rare.  As a result, there are few models for                       analytic techniques that can assess changing patterns of                        interaction using multivariate, categorical data over several                   time points.  The majority of statistical analyses of                           observational data are ill-fitted to the task of describing the                 complexity of behavioral relationships among family members.                    This research will include the development of an application of                 log-linear techniques to the analysis of longitudinal data on                   the family interaction patterns of adolescents.  The                            relationship of these changing patterns to adolescents social                   and personality development and adaptive functioning will be                    assessed.  In addition, a collaborative study using two                         longitudinal data sets will be initiated to examine how the                     context of family interaction alters throughout the life-span                   and how families at different stages of the life-span adjust to                 and facilitate the development of their members.  This research                 will both clarify the causal links among behaviors, attitudes,                  and competencies within the family as a child moves from early                  to late adolescence and aid in the development of new analytic                  strategies for examining longitudional observational data.",
