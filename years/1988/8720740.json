 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will provide continued support of research on rare                   gasses, and isotopes of other rare gasses, from volcanic centers                over hot spots, and along convergent plate margins and                          continental rifts.  Primary emphasis has been on 3He as a                       \"primordial\" tracer for mantle volatiles, and its association                   with methane and the isotopic composition of carbon in CH4 and                  CO2.  The cosmogenic nature of 3He in volcanic lavas has been                   recognized and its usefulness as a tracer in erosion studies has                been demonstrated.  High 3He/4He ratios, relative to Mid-Ocean                  Ridge Basalts, have been identified in eight Pacific hotspot                    terrains, clear evidence of transport of gases from the less                    depleted mantle by rising plumes.  These and similar types of                   research using rare gasses to solve problems of mantle chemistry                and dynamics will continue under the PIs supervision.  This award               will provide for the analysis of many samples already collected,                and will support the operation of the PI's lab for another year",
