 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the greatest threats to maximum performance and system                   reliability in industrial equipment is fouling and corrosion of                 the equipment surfaces.  Fouling and corrosion combined cost the                U.S. billions of dollars annually.  Much of the fouling is due to               biofilms forming on equipment surfaces in contact with water and                significant amounts of corrosion result from the resultant                      microbial activity at the equipment surface (generally a metal                  alloy).  Biodeterioration has been observed on many materials                   including metals, concrete, wood, and plastics.  Despite the                    concern over microbial corrosion, most of its literature contains               anecdotal material.  This investigation focuses on microbial                    corrosion of metals and metal alloys.  Measurements will focus on               defining the metal-biofilm interface through the use of                         microelectrodes and real time electrochemical monitoring of                     corrosion processes.  Microbial process engineering techniques                  will integrate the measurements in a model for                                  describing/predicting microbial corrosion in industrial                         environments.  New instrumentation or new uses for current                      instrumentation related to detecting, identifying, and monitoring               microbial corrosion processes are also anticipated outcomes of                  the research.",
