 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator of this research project has                 recently developed polarographic techniques to measure                          inorganic and organic sulfur species in marine porewaters.                      Included among these species are thiosulfate, sulfite,                          tetrathionate, bisulfide and polysulfide as S(-2), polysulfide                  as S(O), thiols and organic disulfides.  His use of these                       methods for salt marsh porewaters has shown that there is                       cycling between organic and inorganic sulfur species via pyrite                 formation and its consequent oxidation.  He expects similar                     processes may be occurring at the oxic/anoxic interface in the                  Black Sea.                                                                              He proposes 1)  to measure the above sulfur species and 2)              to develop an understanding of their formation, cycling, and                    interactions with metals in Black Sea waters and porewaters.                    In order to accomplish this goal, his research efforts are                      being coordinated with 1)  Drs. Landing and Jacobs who are                      proposing to study trace metal biogeochemistry and speciation,                  and 2)  Drs. Jannasch and Mopper who are proposing to study                     microbiological processes and carbonyl formation respectively                   in the water column of the Black Sea.",
