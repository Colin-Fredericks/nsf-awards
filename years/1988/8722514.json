 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Shirley Tucker of Louisiana State University will                      continue her anatomical and morphological studies of patterns of                flower development in tropical legumes, using methods of light                  and scanning electron microscopy.  She is studying several taxa                 in the subfamily Caesalpinioideae because her preliminary work                  shows that the group is unusually varied in floral ontogeny, and                includes genera with primitive helical patterns of development                  as well as more specialized types of unidirectional formation.                  In addition to documenting intermediate stages between these two                types, Dr. Tucker will determine whether unusual floral features                (such as unisexuality, heteromorphy, or nonradial symmetry)                     result from changes early in development or represent terminal                  additions to ontogenetic sequences.  Another line of                            investigation involves determining the consequences of organ loss               (for example, loss of petals or of stamens) and organ-suppression               (formation of primordial cells followed by abortion) in various                 lineages of legumes.  Floral characters are critical in taxonomic               classification of legumes and in phylogenetic analysis of their                 affinities, and the developmental data acquired in this research                will permit rigorous test of the homology of comparable features                throughout the legume family.",
