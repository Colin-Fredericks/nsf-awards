 "awd_abstract_narration": "A novel technique for the production of uniform, ultrafine                      (~100), dense, monodispersed superconducting ceramics is                        undertaken in this expedited award.  This method exploits the                   ability of single compartment water-in-oil microemulsions to form a             highly selective barrier between its exterior and interior, thus                creating a microvolume reactor in the emulsion microdroplets space.             By appropriate processing, coprecipitation of the mixed metal                   hydroxides (precursors of the superconducting, ceramics) can be                 induced in the internal region of these microemulsions only.  A mixed           metal chloride solution consisting of precalculated ratios of Cu++,             Cu+, Ba++, and Y+++ ions along with ~1 percent w/w dipalmitoyl                  phosphatidylcholine will be sonicated at slightly above the lipid               gel-liquid phase transition temperature to encapsulate some of the              metal and chloride ions inside the water-in-oil microemulsion.                                                                                                  This collaborative project with the University of Rhode Island                  represents the first attempt at using single compartment vesicles for           coprecipitation of metal hydroxides which are precursors for the                recently discovered high temperature superconducting ceramics.  The             critical transition temperature as well as the critical magnetic field          strength are intimately related to the stoichiometry and composition            of the ceramic phase.  These can be varied easily in the proposed               technique by changing the ratio of the cations in the original                  solution.  In contrast, however, the critical current density depends           upon the processing steps used to obtain the final product.  By                 producing ultrafine, dense and uniform particles, it is expected that           higher critical current density will be obtained than that presently            available with sintered superconducting ceramics.",
