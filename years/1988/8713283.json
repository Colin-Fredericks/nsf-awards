 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Professor H. Magdi Selim, Louisiana State                University, to collaborate with Professor Hannes Fluhler, Swiss                 Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich.  They will study the                   mobility and retention of major ions in a soil solution, and they               will develop a model for describing solute interactions and                     transport during transient and water-unsaturated flow in soil and               geological strata.  Laboratory and field experiments will measure               ion-exchange selectivity coefficients and the affinity of exchange              as a function of counter ions.  The major ions to be considered                 include calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium.  The counter ions            are nitrate, chloride, and perchlorate.                                                                                                                         The research will try to determine whether the ion retention                    mechanisms are due to diffusion or other physical and chemical                  interactions.  The studies, performed on Swiss and United States                soils, complement each other.  The research will be done in the                 field and laboratory, on different kinds of soils, and the various              measurements will help determine the necessary parameters for                   validating a soil transport model based on ion exchange processes               for multiple ions.  Most current models do not incorporate multiple             ion interactions, so the complete set of phenomena known to affect              the mobility of solutes is ignored.  Those models that do consider              multiple ion interactions deal primarily with idealized systems of              uniform and water-saturated soils.  The two collaborators have                  successfully worked together in the past and the proposed research              is an extension of their previous research.",
