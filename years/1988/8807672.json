 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are provided for Cornell University to install a Chemical-                Vapor-Deposition (CVD) system for the growth of multilayer,                     multiphase metal and ceramic thin films.  The CVD system will be used           to fabricate multilayer films with an A/B/A/B architecture on the               scale of a few nm, where A and B are different materials.  These                multilayer films will be incorporated into fiber reinforced                     composites in order to control the shear and the tensile properties,            and the high temperature corrosion resistance of interfaces.  Thin              films from carbon (graphite or diamond), alumina, zirconia, silicon-            carbide, silica, platinum and chromium will be synthesized.  These              components can be used to construct multilayer interfaces that are              compatible with a variety of ceramic fibers (carbon, silicon carbide,           titanium boride or alumina) and with matrix materials that include              metals, intermetallics, and ceramics.  The CVD facility ultimately              will be utilized to prepare thin films of single crystal ceramic                materials, beginning with such simple materials as nickel oxide and             zirconia, and leading to the synthesis of single crystal films of               multicomponent ceramics such as tuned ferroelectrics with giant                 electro-optic coefficients and high Tc superconductors.  The ability            to synthesize single crystal ceramic films will measurably enhance              the capability to understand the structure of ceramic and metal-                ceramic interfaces.",
