 "awd_abstract_narration": "A research and training center for quantitative systems biology of         organized macromolecular assemblies will be established.  The center,           formally called the Center for Biophysical Studies on Macromolecular            Assemblies, will be an integral part of a new Institute for Biophysical         Research being developed at The Johns Hopkins University.  The                  Institute and the Biological Research Center will integrate faculty             from different campuses.  Macromolecular assemblies are now known to be         wide spread and include the gene transcription complexes, the membrane          transport systems, contractile fibers, and the complexes present at DNA         replication forks.  These assemblies are central elements to life               processes and lie at the interface between traditional disciplines of           cell biology and biochemistry.  Four interacting projects will be the           initial research focus of the Biological Research Center, namely, the           structure and regulatory interactions of protein-nucleic acid systems,          the molecular mechanics of the cytoskeleton, the structure and function         of protein oligomeric complexes such as proton-translocating ATPases,           and the problem of protein stability and folding.  The overall efforts          of the Center will include collaborative research, interdisciplinary            training, education and outreach.  Through the results of its research          and training programs, the Center for Biophysical Studies on                    Macromolecular Assemblies should have a worldwide impact on fundamental         and applied biology.                                                                 The Center will integrate the new technologies of genetic                  engineering, computational science and molecular graphics, and                  structural instrumentation, to develop a framework for the physical             analysis of the functional mechanisms of macromolecular complexes.              These technologies have set the stage for a new era in the quantitative         biophysical study of organized macromolecular systems.  The general             discipline of quantitative biology and molecular biophysics has been            neglected, but with the advent of the new technologies has become very          important.  These are very central questions in basic biology, and              these research projects will be at the core of advances in basic                biological sciences in the 1990s.  In addition, this work is very               important for the future development of biotechnology and the                   pharmaceutical industry, among other applications.  To strengthen the           already strong group, new faculty positions will be created to add to           the 17 current faculty members.  A special postdoctoral training                program will form a major component of the Center.  This program will           provide a high-level interdisciplinary training for young scientists,           who will be in a good position to advance the emerging field of                 macromolecular systems biology.  The expectation for the collaborative          projects in the center is that a set of general principles and new              conceptual frameworks may emerge.   This would allow a more rigorous            understanding of living systems and more predictive power in the                application of biological science to developing future biotechnologies.",
