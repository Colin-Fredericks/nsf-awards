 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research                        Equipment for the Mathematical Sciences program of the Division                 of Mathematical Sciences.  It is for the purchase of special                    purpose equipment dedicated to the support of research in the                   mathematical sciences.  In general, this equipment is required                  by several research projects, and would be difficult to justify                 for one project alone.  Support from the National Science                       Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions from                     manufacturers, and with substantial cost-sharing from the                       institution submitting the proposal.  This is an instance of                    university, industrial, and government cooperation in the                       support of basic research in the mathematical sciences.                                                                                                          The equipment in this project will be used in the following                    research projects:  (1) Calculations relating the eta invariant                 to bordism and K-theory; (2) Ricci flow, spacetime smoothing,                   and ambitwistorial representation of solutions of Einstein's                    equations; (3) Group-theoretic algorithms and lattices over                     number fields and associated finite geometries; (4) Dimensions                  of irreducible modules in the representation theory of simple                   Lie algebras and algebraic groups; (5) Computation of the                       homology and cohomology of the complexification of the Lie                      algebra of a real reductive Lie group with respect to the                       nilpotent radical of a parabolic subalgebra; (6) Unipotent                      classes of reductive algebraic groups and nilpotent orbits in                   their Lie algebras; and (7) Dual geometries and their                           applications to generalized linear models.",
