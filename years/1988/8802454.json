 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design of systolic arrays for implementing Affine Recurrence                Equations is being carried out.  The goals of this research are (a) the         design of an automated system for generating systolic architectures             from Affine Recurrence Equations and for interfacing with existing VLSI         layout tools; (b) the synthesis of systolic arrays that allows the              design of complicated systolic arrays consisting of a number of sub-            arrays in cascade.  New systolic architectures can be designed using            the theory developed.  The system designed also serves as a testbed for         the new theory.                                                                                                                                                 Systolic arrays are an important class of parallel architectures that           have shown great promise for exploiting the advances in VLSI                    technology.  Since they are problem specific, the development of                automated tools for synthesizing them from high-level specifications is         very important.  This research is directed towards Affine Recurrence            Equations, which covers a general class of practical problems.                  The principal investigator is a new Ph.D. who already has significant           progress in his research.  The research focuses on important and timely         topics.  Support is highly recommended.",
