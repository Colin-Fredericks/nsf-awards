 "awd_abstract_narration": "This prototype project includes several activities to strengthen                minority education from the early grades through the baccalaureate              degree. It was developed under the leadership of the University of St.          Louis-Missouri, with cooperation from Harris-Stowe State College, St.           Louis Community College, and the St. Louis School System. During the            first year of operations a set of activities, based on science and              mathematics experiences, and designed to nurture, encourage and                 motivate minority students, are being implemented. These include a              College Transition program in which pre-freshman students are provided          with experiences in academic skills development, remedial mathematics,          career related work activities, and assistance in college planning.             Activities targeted at the precollege level include junior high school          science and engineering clubs which meet for field trips during the             academic year and for a four-week workshop during the summer. A high            school Science and Math Academy meets for five weeks in the summer at           which academic courses in science and mathematics, tutoring, career             counseling and college planning are made available.",
