 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the nervous systems of all animals the neurons produce                  electrical patterns which signal the next cell about an event.                  This type of communication is well documented and is still under                study.  Central pattern generators are known to be responsible                  for the production of most motor movements.  In the last few                    years, the notion of the central pattern generator as an                        autonomous network producing stereotyped outputs has given way to               a much more complex view.  Central pattern generators are                       multifunctional; that is, a given network of neurons can be                     reorganized to produce a different pattern of activity.  Dr.                    Hillel Chiel is doing research to understand the cellular and                   synaptic basis of pattern generation in neural networks.  His                   research will entail (1) identifying interneurons involved in the               feeding central pattern generator of an invertebrate, (2)                       analyzing their intrinsic biophysical properties and their                      synaptic connections in culture, and (3) reconstructing a part of               the network in culture.  This work is important because it will                 give us new knowledge about the way nerve cells communicate with                each other.",
