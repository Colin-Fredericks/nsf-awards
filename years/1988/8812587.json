 "awd_abstract_narration": "Soil erosion on both natural and cultivated slopes is a serious            problem in the United States and throughout the world.  Effective               solutions to water-induced erosion are impeded by the absence of basic          microlevel understandings of the relationship between precipitation and         erosion processes.  In particular, we lack sound mathematical models            that will predict soil erosion resulting from water flowing across              surfaces in broad sheets (interrill erosion), an important form of              erosion in many regions, especially in arid and semi-arid areas.                Existing models do not take into account loose sediment that has                accumulated on ground surfaces prior to rainfall (detachment storage),          and the omit processes of flow erosion.  This research will refine              models of interrill erosion by including and comparing those variables.              Professor Abrahams and his students will apply simulated rainfall          to matched pairs of experimental plots at the U.S. Department of                Agriculture's Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed in Arizona.  One plot         will be covered with a screen that will dissipate raindrop impact; the          other will receive the full impact of the simulated raindrops.  Thus            the second plot will be subject to erosion from both raindrop impact            and flow erosion, while the first will experience only flow erosion.            The measurements that will be taken on the paired plots will make it            possible to model variations in relative rates of flow and in raindrop          erosion, to calibrate the interrill erosion model and thereby develop           predictive equations, and to compare the characteristics of sediments           eroded by flowing water and by raindrop impact.                                      This project will yield basic insights into a major geomorphologic         process with important implications for soil conservation programs              domestically and abroad.",
