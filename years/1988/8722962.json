 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support a program to develop a quantitative                model for the global structure and dynamics of the solar wind-                  magnetosphere-ionosphere coupled system.  It divides into four                  sub-projects: 1.  Map the magnetic field that links the                         ionosphere to the solar wind through the dayside of the                         magnetosphere.  The solar wind imposes its influence on the                     magnetopshere-ionosphere system mainly by attaching the magnetic                field it carries with it onto the earth's magnetic field, which                 fills the magnetosphere the way air fills a balloon.  The dayside               of the magnetosphere is where the magnetic coupling takes place.                Therefore, mapping the magnetic field in this region is important               because it tells where the solar wind effect is concentrated, and               it allows researchers to see the imprint of the attachment                      process at the ionospheric end, which is relatively accessible.                 2.  Develop a complete model of the magnetohydrodynamic structure               of the global boundary of the magnetosphere.  This is an                        extension of the first project, but the emphasis is on global                   completeness and explicit boundary architecture.  3.  Work out                  the theory by which the solar wind communicates its influence to                the ionosphere through electrical currents flowing between them                 on their linked magnetic field lines.  And 4.  Develop further                  and further apply a model which predicts the ionospheric winds                  that result from 3..                                                                 Overall the aim is to develop a global MHD picture of the                  way in which the sun's plasma energy couples down into the                      atmosphere.",
