 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an attempt to improve the state of the art in the               development of programs, particularly for scientific computing.                 The work includes the development of a new procedural                           programming language, Polya, the development and refinement of                  ideas on program description in the `Gibbs' style, and the                      implementation of a workstation programming environment.  The                   term `Gibbs' denotes a program description that should make it                  easier to write understandable descriptions of scientific                       programs, so that scientists can publish descriptions that can                  and will be read by others.                                                                                                                                     One goal is to improve the state of the art of software                         engineering in one of its crucial areas, the re-use of                          program parts.  This will be done, in part, through new ideas on                modules and their use in Polya.                                                                                                                                 A second goal is to provide scientists with a language and                      environment that will increase their effectivity in writing                     software for supercomputers and other machines.  Direct                         involvement of physicists and other scientists at Cornell will                  ensure that the resulting system is suitable for their use.                                                                                                     This project is split funded between NSF and DARPA, with the                    major contribution coming from DARPA.",
