 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            designed to increase the participation of minorities in scientific and          engineering research by providing support to strengthen the research            environment and capabilities of predominantly minority institutions.            Institutions eligible to participate in this program must have in               addition to a substantial enrollment of minority students, graduate             programs in science or programs in engineering.  Alabama A&M                    University will use RIMI funds to strengthen research and training in           plant cell and tissue culture biotechnology.  The research studies              will develop a tissue culture program in woody plants, expand a plant           cell and tissue culture program in Triticiae (wheat, rye and barley),           and establish a molecular genetics program in Triticiae.  Tissue                culture studies in woody plants will focus on the cultivation of the            holly and the analysis of variation in embryo-derived plants.  The              plant cell and tissue culture program will explore the regeneration of          cereal plants from single cells.  Initial studies will involve the              development of procedures for isolating single cells and screening of           genotypes for regeneration potential.  In addition, recombinant DNA             techniques will be employed to explore interspecies genetic                     variability in wheat and rye.  These studies will be used as a basis            for constructing genetic maps.                                                                                                                                  This project will provide support for graduate students, undergraduate          students and post-doctoral trainees.  The principal investigator is a           well-trained and experienced scientist in plant and soil science who            publishes regularly in refereed journals.  Because of this RIMI                 project, minority faculty and students will have increased                      opportunities to participate in meritorious research in plant and soil          science at Alabama A&M University.",
