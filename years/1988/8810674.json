 "awd_abstract_narration": "The addition of steel fibers to reinforced concrete beams has                   been determined to significantly enhance the mechanical properties of           the member.  However, little research has been reported concerning              the effect of steel fibers on the vibrational characteristics of                regular reinforced and prestressed concrete flexural members.  The              objective of this research program is to experimentally determine the           influence of adding steel fibers to regular reinforced and                      prestressed concrete beams on the vibrational properties (frequency             and damping) of these structural members.  The change in dynamic                response as a function of fiber type, volumetric fiber content,                 regular and prestressing reinforcement  ratios and concrete strength            will be the parameters of study.  The dynamic properties of the                 flexural test specimens will be assessed from the results of free               vibration and forced vibration tests.  All specimens will be tested             in both simply supported and cantilever beam configurations.  The               results obtained from this research project will begin to determine             if the addition of steel fibers to regular reinforced and prestressed           concrete members will result in a significant increase in structural            damping.",
