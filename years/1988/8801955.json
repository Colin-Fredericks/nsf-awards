 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant microbodies and their enzymes represent an attractive                system for studies of the synthesis and compartmentalization of                 organellar proteins.  Dr. Becker intends to continue our                        investigation of the appearance and import of both glyoxysomal                  and peroxisomal enzymes in the cotyledons of cucumber (Cucumis                  sativus) seedlings during early postgerminative development.  At                the molecular level, Dr. Becker has already shown, by in vitro                  translation, that regulation of enzyme accumulation is primarily                at a pretranslational level.  He has now isolated cDNA clones                   for two glyoxysomal enzymes and two peroxisomal enzymes.  These                 clones will be used as probes to assay for transcript appearance                during post germinative development and greening of cotyledons.                 He also intends to isolate and sequence genomic clones and to                   characterize their regulatory sequences.  If time permits, he                   plans to begin a functional analysis of gene regulation using                   Arabidopsis thaliana, for which conditionally-lethal                            photorespiratory mutants are available.  At the subcellular                     level, he intends to study the mechanism whereby microbody                      proteins are targeted to  and imported into the organelle, using                both in vitro and in vivo approaches.                                           %%%                                                                                 Many cellular metabolic pathways require enzymes that are                   encoded by the nuclear genome and synthesized on cytoplasmic                    ribosomes, yet are active only within specific membrane-bound                   compartments.  The appearance of such metabolic pathways during                 development therefore involves both expression of the appropriate               genetic information and the compartmentalization of the gene                    products.  Dr. Becker is studying the development of the enzymes                involved in photorespiration. The enzymes responsible for these                 pathways all come to be localized in a membrane bound organelles                and Dr. Becker plans to use molecular genetic techniques to                     determine how these enzymes are transported across the membrane                 into the subcellular organelles where they function.",
