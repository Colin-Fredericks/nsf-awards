 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many sessile marine invertebrates depend on forced                      convection of seawater to deliver particulate food, dissolved                   nutrients, and respiratory gases.  Previous work with passive                   suspension feeding cnidarians has shown that the state of flow                  in the boundary layer over the organism is the most important                   determinant of particle and gas flux.  The theory of mass                       transfer has been under-utilized in the analysis of convection                  mediated gas flux in aquatic invertebrates.  I propose to                       investigate how flow modulates exchange processes in several                    species of boreal and temperate cnidarians through experiments                  using gas microelectrodes, recirculating flow respirometry,                     cell layer organism analogs, heated model organism analogs, and                 field morphometry.  The goals of this study include: (1) an                     understanding of the effects of organism size, geometry, and                    spacing on the Sherwood/Reynolds number relationship, (2)                       measurement of the frequency of diffusional boundary layer                      limitation and turbulent enhancement effects in real turbulent                  flows in shallow subtidal hibitats (3) testing of diffusional                   similarity models as a scheme for understanding the allometry                   of polypal geometry in cnidarians, and (4) investigation of                     microelectrode diffusional boundary layer mapping as a                          physiological probe of areal exchange coefficients and their                    relationship with animal structure and the momentum boundary                    layer.  The results of this gas exhanges study will also give                   insights into uptake of DOM and some aspects of osmoregulation,                 and will be useful to workers interested in estimating                          secondary productivity in marine habitats.  This work will have                 application to the study of fouling communities, coral reef                     ecology, and near-shore benthic processes.",
