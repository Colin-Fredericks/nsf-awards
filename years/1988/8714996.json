 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is focused on determining the phosphate                   sources, reactions and time-scales involved in the precipita-                   tion and aging of authigenic phosphate in sediments of Santa                    Barbara Basin, California.  Preliminary data from the basin                     indicate that authigenic phosphate is precipitating from pore                   waters within the upper 25 cm of the sediment column.  These                    data also suggest that high concentrations of dissolved                         phosphate in the uppermost centimeter are coupled to a mat of                   filamentous sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, Beggiatoa spp., which                    blankets the sediment-water interface.  The field portion of                    the program will include 1) seasonal collections of the mat and                 underlying sediments for fine-scale biomass, pore water and                     solid phase sampling, and 2) in situ measurements of millimeter                 -scale gradients of pore water oxygen and pH.  In the labora-                   tory, investigations will be conducted of the petrology,                        mineralogy, chemistry, and isotopic compositions of individual                  sediments lamina and separated phosphatic phases.  These latter                 efforts should provide definitive data for evaluating the                       nature, stability, and accumulation rates of phases precursory                  to carbonate fluorapatite.  The contribution of Beggiatoa                       biomass to the total diagenetic phosphate flux, as well as the                  influence of the chemical microenvironment of the mat on other                  mechanisms of phosphate regeneration, such as iron-oxyhydroxide                 shuttling, will also be determined.  Overall, the results will                  contribute to our understanding of the primary processes that                   remove phosphorus from the ocean to the global sedimentary                      reservoir.",
