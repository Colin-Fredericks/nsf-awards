 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Philadelphia Elementary Science Kit Collaboration (PESKC) of The            Franklin Institute is a model urban alliance that includes the museum,          local corporations and the School District of Philadelphia.  Since 1983         this partnership has successfully piloted hands-on science kits and             workshops to support the use of activity kits in the K - 6 classrooms           and to increase the content area preparation of elementary teachers.            PESKC has four primary goals:                                                                                                                                        --to develop and produce twenty-eight science activity kits that                  will augment and support four major curriculum goals.                                                                                                         --to provide professional development workshops for Philadelphia                  teachers to train them in the effective use of the kits and to                  improve their competence and confidence as science educators.                                                                                                 --to expand a network that will link elementary teachers to science               resources in the local community.                                                                                                                             --to continue an active program for dissemination of kits and urban               partnership model to defray development cost and support the                    replication of the program in urban and other communities across                the nation.                                                                                                                                              Additional merits of this proposal have been its success in a large             racially diverse urban school district, the manufacturing of the kits in        Philadelphia by a non-profit job training agency that provides jobs for         those who find it difficult to secure employment, and the firm                  commitment of The School District of Philadelphia to maintain                   permanently the elementary science kit after implementation ends in             1991.                                                                                                                                                           In summary, this proposal addresses a need in elementary classooms and          provides persuasive evidence that PESKC will institutionalize numerous          mechanisms to insure the effectiveness of the materials, teacher                education and dissemination of the model.  The leadership is excellent          as is the reputation of The Franklin Museum of Science.  The program is         consistent with the objectives of Instructional Materials Development           Guidelines and shows the promise of being of high quality.",
