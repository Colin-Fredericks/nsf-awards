 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is to understand, through simulation and                          experimental studies, the failure mechanisms of new high-density                and high-speed memory technologies such as silicon DRAM's                       (dynamic random-access memory) with trench-type cell capacitor,                 GaAs (Gallium Arsenide) HEMT (High-Electron Mobility Transistor)                SRAM's (static random-access memory) and CMOS (complementary                    metal oxide semiconductor) neural network associative memories.                 Based in this fault characterization, Dr. Mazumder proposes to                  develop appropriate test methodologies.  His research is in three               phases.  The first phase investigates  a new on-chip double-error               correction circuit for the multi-megabit Silicon DRAM.  This                    circuit will correct double-bit/word-line soft errors that                      cannot be corrected by conventional error correcting circuits.                  In the second phase, he is developing a comprehensive fault model               and efficient parametric test algorithms for high-speed GaAs HEMT               Static RAM; and is investigating built-in self-test circuits to                 generate the algorithms.  The third problem is how to test neural               network associative memories and a study of error correction                    capabilities of such memories in the presence of faulty                         components and erroneous input data.",
