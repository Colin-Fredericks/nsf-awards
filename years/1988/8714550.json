The objective of the researchers is to            study, using various spectroscopic techniques, the structure of                 copper proteins in the determination and control of biological                  functions.                                                                                                                                                      Copper is one of the most widespread and versatile transition metals            with a functional role in living systems.  Many metallo-proteins                related to a variety of biological functions such as oxygen                     transport, electron transfer, hydroxylation and oxidative catalysis,            involve copper in some manner.  Copper proteins share a general                 structural feature that allows them to modify the polarity of active            sites, control the hydration of substrates, and play an important               role during the course of catalysis.  Yet, copper proteins vary                 widely in complexity of molecular architecture as well as in their              mechanism of enzyme catalysis.  However, copper sites may be                    classified into three broad categories depending on their                       spectroscopic characteristics.  The investigators plan to study one             of these categories (Type 3 copper sites) and the behavior of these             sites during the interactions with other copper centers in                      multi-copper enzymes.  The research program will involve the study of           hemocyanin, laccase and ceruloplasmin, which contain Type 3 copper              units in different molecular environments and have different                    enzymatic activities.  The hemocyanin research group in Padova is one           of the leading centers for the comparative study of this protein,               having combined expertise in its physical, biological and biophysical           chemistry, whereas at Yeshiva University there is unique                        instrumentation and expertise relevant to elucidation of structure              from information obtainable by spectroscopic methods.",
