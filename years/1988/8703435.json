 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates several aspects of wireless office                 information networks with particular emphasis in manufacturing                  environments and surrounding offices.  The focus is on developing               a reliable and accurate statistical model and computer simulation               for indoor radio channels, innovative methods to increase the                   data rates of both wideband spread spectrum and narrowband                      transmission techniques, and various multiple accessing and                     network architectures suitable for fading multi-path indoor                     channels.                                                                         The principle investigator (PI) will perform wide band channel                measurements in several manufacturing plants and offices to be                  used to develop the model and simulation.  He will analyze the                  throughput and delay characteristic of ALOHA-like and other                     multiple accessing techniques in fading indoor environments and                 compare distributed and central networks for this application.                  He will also analyze performance, data rate limitations and                     improvements in data rate for spread spectrum techniques.",
