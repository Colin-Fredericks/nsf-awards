 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will make available recent developments in quantitative            research on American society to undergraduate teachers.  These                  developments are based in the creation of large data sets on American           society, in the application of powerful statistical techniques to               contingency table analysis, and in programming these techniques for             micro-computers.  In addition, instructional materials have been                developed in the last few years which facilitate the undergraduate              teachers' task of conveying this knowledge to undergraduates.                                                                                                   The convergence of these developments will be the focus of an                   interdisciplinary program for enhancing undergraduate faculty skills.           In each of three years, twenty faculty who teach primarily                      undergraduates in sociology, political science and American history will        participate in an intensive, seven-day introductory workshop at Harvard         University.  The Workshop will be led by James A. Davis, who created the        General Society Survey, contributed to the Development of contingency           table analysis and development of contingency table analysis and                developed the micro-computer programs which make these data and                 statistical techniques accessible to undergraduates.  Participating             faculty will cover the major substantive findings from the GSS and the          National Election Study (NES), statistical techniques and computer              programs which make these findings accessible at the undergraduate              level, and also work with student exercises and data sets created by the        staff of the workshop; that explore these recent developments on                microcomputers.                                                                                                                                                 Following the initial Workshop, faculty participants will prepare their         own instructional materials adapting these new developments to their            individual teaching situations.  Workshop participants will return              within a year for a shorter Demonstration Workshop in which they discuss        the instructional innovations they have made with other graduates of            their workshop and up-date their knowledge about data and appropriate           computer programs.  Over the three years, it is expected that the               Programs will have a significant impact on undergraduate teaching about         American Society at the institutions represented.                                                                                                               In addition to the NSF funds, participants' institutions will                   contribute about 10% in travel costs to the operation of the project.",
