 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this SBIR Phase I proposal is to perform                  experiments, guided by theory, to define and quantify the                       performance envelope of a new selective laser sintering process.  In            this process, a powder surface is raster-scanned with a high-power              laser beam to fuse powder in areas to be occupied by the part at                that particular cross-section.  In areas not sintered, the powder               remains loose and may be removed once the part is complete.                     Successive layers of powder are then deposited and raster-scanned               until the entire part is produced.  A general three-dimensional                 object can be produced in this way directly from a solid model or               other three-dimensional computer database.  The research effort will            be directed toward investigation of process mechanics, material                 evaluation, effects of additives, and assessment of achievable                  strengths, dimensional tolerances, and part production rates.  If               successful, a follow-on Phase II is planned.",
