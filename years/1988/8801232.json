 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dielectric resonators are the building elements for miniaturized                microwave circuits, used in communications microwave measurements, and          radars.  An accurate numerical solution of the electromagnetic field            in and around the dielectric resonator is needed in order to provide            the design data for building the components which contain dielectric            resonators.  The design diagrams and tables, which will be obtained in          the present investigation, are of importance to practicing microwave            engineers, since the characterization of dielectric resonators is               considerably more difficult than the characterization of the empty              microwave resonant cavities, which the dielectric resonators are                replacing with substantial savings in cost.  Furthermore, for the               applications in the computerized-assisted design methods (CAD), the             development of numerically effective and reliable computational                 procedures is of great importance.  The experimental investigation in           this project will concentrate on the development of automated                   measurement procedures, and processing of the data obtained by these            procedures.  The applications of this investigation are foreseen in             the improvements of the complex permittivity measurements at microwave          frequencies.",
