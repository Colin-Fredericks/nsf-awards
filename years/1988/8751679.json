 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes a partnership among San Diego County Schools, the         University of California at San Diego, Research Centers, and industry to        improve the quality of science instruction at the elementary (k-6)              school level.  The program will span a three year period and encompass a        five week on-campus summer institute during each year of the program as         well as a series of 8 meetings during the academic school year.                                                                                                 Year One of the program will emphasize the Life Sciences, Year Two Earth        and Environmental Sciences, and Year Three the Physical Sciences.  An           attempt will be made to integrate all science content areas with each           other and with reading and mathematics.                                                                                                                         The major goal of the project is to educate 100 Resource/Mentor teachers        who will return to their schools and provide inservice programs in              science content and methodology.  Commitments to participate in the             program have been received from 27 school districts.                                                                                                            This project is of particular interest to the Teacher Enhancement               Program in that it is county-wide and involves all segments of the              community in a cooperative effort to begin improving the system at the          elementary level.",
