 "awd_abstract_narration": "The marine laboratory of the Department of Marine Sciences,                Univerity of Puerto Rico is uniquely situated to provide an easy                access to a wide variety of tropical marine habitats.  The field                station has a permanent resident staff and a number of well                     equipped laboratories.  Departmental faculty have in recent years               demonstrated an increased productivity in terms of publications                 and grant support for basic research.  At the same time, the                    number of outside scientists desiring to utilize the Department's               field station as a base for their own or collaborative research                 has also increased.  Presently, a number of U.S. mainland and                   foreign scientists regularly utilize the Department's facilities.               However, visitor demand has reached a point where the present                   accommodations are no longer adequate.  This project provides                   funds for construction of a dry laboratory for use principally by               visiting scientists, a wet laboratory which will be suitable for                controlled-environment experimentation, and equipment.  The                     equipment items are commonly requested for use by visitors.",
