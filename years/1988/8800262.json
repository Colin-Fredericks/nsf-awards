 "awd_abstract_narration": "Individual feeding patterns in two species of polyphagous                       grasshoppers will be studied to evaluate the impact of genetic                  and non-genetic factors on diet selection.  Feeding by                          polyphagous grasshoppers is currently viewed as selective among                 plant species, but generalized among any of several preferred,                  substitutable hosts.  Local abundance of preferred food plants                  is thus generally thought to affect individual diet breadth.                    This idea will be tested against the alternatives that plants                   consumed by generalist feeders are complementary resources, and                 that specialized feeding is due to genetic adaptation to host                   plants or to preferences induced during development.  In order to               determine the breadth of individual diets and relative                          proportions of specialist and generalist feeders in each                        population, occurrence of plant species in fecal pellets of                     marked individuals within enclosures will be quantified.                        Measures of variation in fitness-related characters in full and                 half-sib families of grasshoppers (derived from insects with                    known dietary histories, raised on different diet treatments)                   will be taken.  Such data will provide information on the degree                of individual polyphagy within populations, clarify the reasons                 why individuals feed as they do, and permit detailed analysis of                the genetic structure of two hemimetabolous insect populations.                 Research will be done during a two-year postdoctoral fellowship                 tenure at the University of California, Berkeley.",
