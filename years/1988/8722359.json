This workshop is the 14th program sponsored by IGCP                             156--Phosphorites (International Geological                                     Correlation Program) in ten years and only the second                           to be held south of Mexico. It will bring together                              scientists from North and South America to discuss the                          genesis of the Cenozoic sediments of the Pisco Basin                            and their revelance as a resource for the developing                            countries of the region.                                                                                                                                        The organizers have planned an ambitious program which                          will benefit their own research as well as the                                  Peruvian geological community. Two Peruvian scientists                          are involved, Dr. Jose Cruzado C. from PetroPeru and                            Ing. R. Cruzado from the Universidad de San Marcos,                             both in Lima. Additional scientists from other                                  Peruvian universities, PetroPeru, and the Peruvian                              Geological Society will participate as well as                                  scientists from other Latin American countries to be                            chosen through IGCP National Committees. Clearly,                               valuable contacts will be made, information exchanged                           and future collaborations explored.",
