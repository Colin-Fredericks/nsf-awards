 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-and-one-half year project involving teachers, university               faculty, parents, students, retired teachers, and school district               personnel will significantly enhance the mathematics background and             pedagogical skills of thirty-two underprepared eighth-grade mathematics         teachers in a predominantly minority urban school district.  Throughout         the duration of the project, City University of New York (CUNY) faculty         and master teachers will provide the participants with mathematics              instruction in areas relevant to the curriculum.  During the academic           year, participants will also practice and improve their teaching                techniques in a Saturday Mathematics Academy attended by eighty                 underachieving students and their parents.  On a rotating basis, they           will teach the students, observe their colleagues' teaching, and advise         parents on ways in which they can support learning at home.  Retired            teachers will serve as mentors for the participants and will assist them        in translating their experiences from the Saturday Mathematics Academy          into their regular classrooms.  The evaluation will involve                     participants, their students, and their students' parents, and, at the          end of the project, a dissemination meeting will be held for                    administrators from other interested school districts.                                                                                                          The project is a collaboration between City College and New York City           School District 10, which are contributing $286,478 in cost-sharing.            Its combination of extensive instruction in content with regular                opportunities to practice newly learned teaching techniques provides a          model for significantly improving the qualifications of underprepared           teachers that could be replicated by other urban school districts.",
