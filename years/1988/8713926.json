Ordered monolayer structures may form on                the single crystal substrates, and, if so, the influence of these               structures on catalytic activity will be observed.  Results will                be compared with and related to data on high-surface catalysts of               the same composition.                                                                                                                                           Oxides supported on oxides comprise a significant fraction of                   industrial catalysts; they are widely used for the selective                    oxidation of hydrocarbons.  Real catalysts have been studied, but               this is a proposal to study \"model\" catalysts - near planar                     structures similar in chemical composition to the very porous                   real catalysts.  For many techniques, model systems are much                    easier to study and give more detailed information.",
