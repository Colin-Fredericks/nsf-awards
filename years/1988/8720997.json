 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some attempts to understand surfactant adsorption on the molecular              level have recently been reported although the effect of electrostatic          interactions between the adsorbing surface and the surfactant are               still poorly understood.  As a result, most current descriptions of             surfactant adsorption remain empirical and thus are not predictive.             This investigation uses a modification of the most recent theoretical           models to predict the adsorption of singly charged surfactants as well          as experimental adsorption measurements to test the results of the              modeling.  This project is unique in the use of the observation that            surfactant adsorption can increase with increasing surface charge               density of the same sign.  This result may be due to changes in the             configuration of the adsorbed materials brought on by electrostatic             repulsions between their ionic end groups and the adsorbing surface.            The changes in adsorption behavior that have been observed are quite            large indicating significant changes at the molecular level.  By                experimenting in a region where surfactant adsorption is very                   sensitive to surface charge density, the greatest amount of                     information about electrostatic interactions is obtained in this work.                                                                                          Surface active materials are used in many processes today and are               likely to find even wider application in the future.  The impact of a           better understanding of the adsorption process for surface active               agents is manyfold.  Current trends in chemical processing are towards          micro-engineering, control of processes at the molecular level.                 Surfactants are one of the major means of obtaining this control.  The          results of this investigation could find immediate application in such          fields as flotation, dispersion, separations and ceramic processing--           with future applications in microelectronics.",
