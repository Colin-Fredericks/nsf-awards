 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to introduce current techniques in             molecular genetics into the undergraduate biology curriculum.  The              equipment it provides is making it possible to offer a new laboratory           course in Molecular Biology, as well as to improve the present Cell             Biology, Microbiology, and General Biology course laboratories.                 Approximately 170 students per year, at all undergraduate levels, will          be affected by these changes.                                                                                                                                        The new equipment includes a bacteriologic incubator and water             bath shaker to culture bacteria for the isolation of plasmids; a CO2            incubator and laminar-flow clean benches for student work with tissue           culture; microcentrifuges for DNA/RNA purification and concentration;           horizontal agarose gel units and a DNA-detection camera system to               separate and analyse the products of restriction enzyme digestions; a           polyacrylamide slab gel unit to analyze the products of in vitro                transcription reactions; fluorescence illuminators to detect the cell-          surface expression of the product of a transferred gene; and an                 ultraflow freezer for the long-term preservation of the bacterial               strains and cell lines used in the experiments described.                                                                                                            By acquainting students with the methodology involved in                   molecular cloning and gene expression, this project is enhancing their          academic experience, increasing their awareness of the scientific               process, and preparing them more fully for scientific careers.  The             grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal sum                 obtained from non-Federal sources.",
