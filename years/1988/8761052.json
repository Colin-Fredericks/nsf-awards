 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nitrous oxide is an important trace atmospheric species which                   plays a key role in the atmospheric greenhouse problem as well as               the destruction of stratospheric ozone.  Its concentration in the               atmosphere is rising due to anthropogenic sources related to                    agricultural productivity and the burning of coal and heavy fuel                oil.  This grant is to evaluate and develop a new, reliable, cost               effective, rugged and nonintrusive method of measuring nitrous                  oxide in either the free atmosphere or in combustion exhaust gas                streams.  The proposed measurement technique is based on a dual                 gaseous Xenon.  This measurement method could also be integrated                with eddy correlation of flux measurement techniques to yield                   both concentration and vertical flux measurements of nitrous                    oxide from airborne or ground based platforms.                                                                                                                  If pursued through prototype development (Phase II), the proposed               research would result in a new instrumental capability to perform               nitrous oxide concentration and flux measurements from a wide                   variety of airborne and ground based platforms.  Commercial                     instrumentation for both research and regulatory monitoring                     purposes would be less expensive, more accurate, and more                       reliable than any current method.  Instrumentation to measure                   nitrous oxide concentration in exhausts from fossil fuel                        combustors would also be developed.",
