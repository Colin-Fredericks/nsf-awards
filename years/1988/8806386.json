 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently Drs. Wyatt and Stoneburner have provided the first                molecular evidence for the probable hybrid origin of a natural                  species of moss, Plagiomnium medium.  Using methods of isozyme                  analysis, widely employed in studies of flowering plants but only               recently adapted to mosses, these scientists found protein                      composition in the moss to reflect additive components of two                   presumed parental species in the northern United States.  The                   hybrid has double the number of chromosomes found in the two                    parents, and is fully fertile.  This mechanism of species                       formation, by hybridization followed by chromosome doubling, has                been amply documented in flowering plants, but not in mosses                    heretofore.  Drs. Wyatt and Stoneburner will continue to sample                 more populations of these moss species and will extend the                      project to analyses of additional presumptive cases, where known                chromosome counts suggest a probable hybrid origin.  In the                     laboratory the investigators will attempt to cross-fertilize the                presumptive parents in order to duplicate experimentally the                    hybrid species.  Despite differences in the basic biology of                    mosses, with their dominant haploid life-cycle, this new work                   demonstrates fundamental similarity in a mechanism of evolution                 operating in all other land plants.",
