 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overt behaviors that differentiate the interactions of                      distressed and nondistressed married couples are well                           documented.  Little is known, however, about the thoughts and                   feelings (i.e., appraisals) that spouses experience before and                  after their interactions.  These appraisals are likely to be                    important because of their potential association with marital                   interactionand satisfaction.  Consequently, in this study                       appraisals in distressed and nondistressed marriages will be                    assessed beforeand after discussion of a marital problem, by                    asking spouses to respond to a series of open-ended and                         structured questions.  A 12-month follow-up assessment of                       marital satisfaction will be conducted to examine the                           longitudinal relation between appraisals and changes in marital                 satisfaction.                                                                                                                                                   Analyses will be conducted to test the hypotheses that (a)                      distressed spouses will make relatively dysfunctional pre-                      interaction and post-interaction appraisals, (b)                                pre-interaction and post-interaction appraisals will be closely                 related, and (c)dysfunctional pre-interaction and                               post-interaction appraisals will predict declines in                            satisfaction.                                                                                                                                                   This research will generate and test theory that advances the                   conceptual foundation of marriage beyond the study of behavior,                 and may help in predicting and preventing marital distress.",
