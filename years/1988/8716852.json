 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, the investigators would carry out a Nd, Sr,              and Pb isotopic study of samples collected by ALVIN and dredged                 by other ships from the spreading axes in the Mariana Trough                    and the Lau Basin, both very important back arc basins in the                   western Pacific.  These two sample sets are extremely valuable                  since they were collected at a very fine scale and at a great                   cost and considerable geophysical measurements were made at the                 sample sites.  Besides, visual observational data exist with                    the ALVIN samples.  Major element and trace element analyses                    are being done on these samples, as part of other NSF supported                 projects.  The combined elemental and isotopic data set will                    help in understanding various magmatic processes in marginal                    basins, such as, nature and scale of source variability of                      magma, partial melting of rocks and mixing of magma,                            segmentation of the spreading ridge, etc.  Also the study will                  indicate the extent of inhomogeneity in the mantle under these                  back arc basins.                                                                        Back arc basins have been somewhat neglected by the                     community but they hold important clues for the overall                         understanding of the plate tectonic processes.  //",
