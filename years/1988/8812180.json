 "awd_abstract_narration": "The locomotory muscles of fishes have an extraordinary ability to alter         their biochemical, physiological, and performance characteristics in            response to ontogenetic, physiological, and environmental influences.           Dr. Somero and his colleagues will experimentally modify the                    biochemical properties of white- and red muscles to establish clearer           links between biochemical status and locomotory capacity.  They will            vary muscle biochemical state through altered dietary regimen and,              then, quantitate enzymatic activities and swimming performance.  They           will determine how variations in transcriptional and translational              activity and in protein turnover establish final concentrations of ATP          generating enzymes.  They will swim fishes at different intensities and         measure how the intracellular localization--the compartmentalization--          of enzymes varies.  Measurements of pH and of effectors that influence          enzyme compartmentalization will be made concomitantly.  Body size              influences the levels of ATP generating enzymes in muscle and the               regulatory mechanisms and will be evaluated.  The regulatory mechanisms         responsible for these size-dependent (\"scaling\") changes will be                studied using techniques to quantify RNA concentrations and to measure          protein synthesis and protein degradation.  Deep-sea fish will be               maintained in the laboratory to determine the extent to which the               greatly reduced metabolic rates and swimming capabilites of these               fishes are due to intrinsic, genetically-based factors, on the one              hand, and dietary factors, on the other.  They will attempt to bring            the muscle biochemical robustness (e.g., enzyme levels and RNA                  concentrations) to the highest possible levels in these deep-living             forms to establish their ultimate potential for activity and growth.            The goal is an understanding of the biochemical and physiological basis         for variations in locomotor capacity in fish.",
