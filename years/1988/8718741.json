 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary sequence of the cytochrome subunit of the                           flavocytochrome p-cresol methylhydroxylase has been                             determined, as has the sequence of the first 52 amino acids                     of the flavoprotein subunit.  X-ray crystallographic data at                    3 A resolution have been fitted to these data and much of the                   tertiary structure has been unravelled.  The rest of the                        sequence is being determined by DNA sequencing.  The                            reversible dissociation of the flavocytochrome into subunits                    has been extensively investigated, as has its kinetic                           mechanism, using flash photolysis, stopped-flow, and steady-                    state kinetic methods.  The reaction sequence catalyzed by                      the enzyme has been shown to include a vinyl derivative.  The                   biochemical events underlying the neurotoxicity of MPTP, a                      contaminant in an illicit meperidine analog, has been                           determined and in vivo toxicity correlated with enzymological                   data.  A new metabolite carrier which pumps MPP+, the                           oxidation product of MPTP, into the mitochondrial matrix, has                   been discovered and partially characterized.  Extensive                         kinetic studies have been completed on salicylate                               hydroxylase, using a novel procedure to isolate the enzyme.                     The kinetic and molecular characteristics of an \"inner\" and                     an \"outer\" carnitine acyltransferase have been compared and                     peroxisomes shown to be the likely source of the the outer                                                                                                      enzyme.",
