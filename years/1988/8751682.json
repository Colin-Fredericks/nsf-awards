 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes a four-year program with the first three years          funded by NSF and the fourth funded by the University and other outside         sources.  The primary objective is to improve instruction in secondary          school science laboratories by using the computer as a tool either to           analyze conventionally acquired data or to both acquire and then analyze        data. This dual role for the computer lends credibility to the                  acquisition of different skills in the disciplines of biology,                  chemistry, earth science and physics. Two teachers from each                    participating school will be selected to develop the strategies in each         of these two instructional modes.  This will be further enhanced by a           series of school-site visits and sharing conferences.Each year, 30              well-prepared teachers will be selected to attend a three-week summer           workshop, followed by the visits and conferences during the school year.        Appropriate laboratory computer applications will be developed and              refined, using both original and existing materials. The applications,          including implementation and teaching strategies, as well as the                workshop materials, will be disseminated nationally through                     presentations at professional meetings. An ongoing evaluation of                materials, instructional strategies and effectiveness in the classroom          will enhance the potential for success. About 28% of the cost of this           project is being shared by Ithaca College and the participating school          districts.  This will insure the implementation of the program in the           schools and the continuation into year four. Additional private source          funding is being sought for year four, but sufficient commitment is             included to provide for the project as written.",
