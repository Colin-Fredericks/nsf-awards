 "awd_abstract_narration": "Image segmentation is a crucial step in image analysis and is required          before any high-level symbolic manipulation can be performed on the             image.  The overall goal of this project is to carry out the VLSI design        and implementation of an image segmentation algorithm useful for                analyzing industrial, biomedical and military images.  A gradient               relaxation chip was fabricated and tested in Phase I of this project.           Also a board-level prototype was constructed to implement real-time image       segmentation using this chip.                                                                                                                                   In Phase II of the project the segmentation algorithm is being refined          and evaluated.  Then the entire segmentation system will then be                fabricated in VLSI.  The system will be evaluated using industrial,             biomedical, and military images.                                                This grant is part of a projected three phase program sponsored by NSF          under the Small Business Innovation Research program.  In this second           phase effort, the researchers are building a VLSI chip for the purpose of       real-time image segmentation.  Such segmentation is the first step in           allowing a robot to \"understand\" an image so as to facilitate automated         assembly.",
