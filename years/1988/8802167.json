 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this research is to characterize the                   mRNA population of aged pea epicotyls before and after wounding,                as a prerequisite to understanding the molecular basis by which                 plants respond to this pervasive stress.  The hypothesis to be                  tested suggests that wounding causes disruption of the plasma                   membrane, thereby permitting a transient influx of calcium.                     Either directly or indirectly calcium than activates some genes,                including genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis.  Ethylene                    turns on different genes, including perhaps genes encoding                      polysaccaridases which cleave oligosaccharins (elicitors) from                  cell walls, thereby activating yet another set of genes.                                                                                                        Wounding constitutes one of the most pervasive of the stresses to               which plants are subjected and is caused by physical factors such               as wind and hail, and by biological agents such as large                        herbivores, insects and fungi.  Since wounding by pathogens is                  such a widespread phenomenon, an understanding of plants'                       responses to this stress would provide the baseline information                 common to all injurious pathogens, such that the responses                      specific to pathogenicity could be more clearly identified.                     Wounding is also performed, albeit unwittingly, in conventional                 research, especially in attempts to facilitate uptake of                        exogenous compounds.  Results found here might determine how                    misleading such protocols are.",
