 "awd_abstract_narration": "A biochemical engineering conference is being held to bring together            academic, government, and industrial groups carrying out research               directed towards the advancement of biochemical engineering principles          and practice.  The theme of the conference is biochemical engineering           for technology leading to processes and products of economic value.             The conference was organized by the United Engineering Trustees with            the advice of an executive committee.  The biochemical engineering              conference series has been at the forefront of disseminating                    information on engineering technology and research in the rapidly               changing field of biotechnology and realization of its commercial               potential.                                                                                                                                                      The major technical roadblock to bioproduct marketing is the lack of            innovative engineering applied to both the upstream and downstream              processing.  Dilute solutions and extreme broth contamination makes             separation and purification of  many products economically impossible.          This conference will play an important role in the eventual solution            of these technical problems by bringing together the world experts in           biochemical engineering to address the issues.",
