 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates how metabolic energy is coupled to                    betaine transport in Lactobacillus acidophilus, i.e., whether                   it is ATP-driven or chemiosmotically coupled to the flux of                     H+ or other ions.  A second objective is to investigate the                     mechanism by which osmotic upshock activates the transport                      carrier.  The effects of varying the driving forces for                         transport and the osmotic pressure on betaine uptake will be                    studied, employing primarily intact cells and membrane                          vesicles.  The third objective is to clone the betaine                          permease gene of Lactobacillus into Escherichia coli to study                   energy coupling mechanisms and regulation in a system that is                   better understood with respect to bioenergetics.  The                           permease gene will be cloned into Gram positive bacteria of                     industrial and agricultural importance, such as Streptococcus                   and Clostridium.                                                                %%%                                                                             Many species of bacteria tolerate high salinity by                              accumulating high levels of low-molecular weight chemicals.                     One stain has been isolated that is significantly more                          resistant to osmotic stress than other strains because it                       possesses an active glycine betaine (betaine)-specific active                   transport system.  This betaine permease is unique in that it                   is activated, and not induced, by increased osmotic pressure,                   and thus offers a new opportunity for studying regulation of                    solute transport.",
