 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ia glycoproteins encoded by the I region of the murine                  major histocompatibility complex (MHC) play a critical role in                  the generation of the T cell repertoire, and in T cell                          recognition of antigen.  The goal of the proposed research is to                analyze at the cellular and molecular level, the selective                      pressure Ia molecules impose on the generation of the T cell                    repertoire.  The model to be studied is the Ia mutant B6.C-H-                   2bm12 (bm12) mouse and its wildtype counterpart, the C57Bl/6 (B6)               mouse, since the bm12 mutation in Ia has created functionally                   distinct Ia restriction sites.  To understand how Ia molecules                  influence the T cell repertoire, Dr. Hochman proposes to: 1.                    define precisely how the bm 12 mutation has altered the                         restriction and specificity of antigen specific T cell                          recognition, and 2. to begin to analyze how the bm12 mutation                   alters the selection and rearrangement of V genes from shared                   (bm12-B6) T cell receptor gene pools.  B6 and bm12 T cell                       hybridomas specific for peptide fragments of well defined protein               antigens will be prepared and assessed for their ability to                     recognize antigen fragments in the context of Ia epitopes unique                for or shared by Ia of b and Ia of bm12.  This will allow for the               definition of the multiplicity of restricting epitopes a unique                 Ia molecule can express.  She will then begin to undertake                      molecular analyses of the alpha and beta genes encoding the                     antigen receptor of these cells by constructing cDNA libraries,                 isolating alpha and beta gene clones, and sequencing variable                   regions of these genes to understand how Ia molecules control the               construction of diverse repertoires when choosing from shared T                 cell receptor gene pools.                                                            An animal's ability to respond to a particular antigen is                  controlled by immune response (Ia) genes which are associated                   with the major histocompatibility complex.  The mechanism by                    which these genes regulate responsiveness is controversial.                     Although many laboratories are undertaking structural analyses of               immune response gene function, this mutant mouse model provides a               unique tool with which to study the selective pressure that Ia                  genes impose on the selection and rearrangement of T cell antigen               receptor genes and, thus, the range of antigens to which an                     animal can respond.",
