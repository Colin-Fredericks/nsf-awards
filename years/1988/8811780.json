The main goal is to increase            the contribution of this minority institution to the nations scientific         and developmental research activities.  The plan is designed to                 strengthen the research environment by supporting faculty research in           the field of Computer Science, acquisition of modern research equipment         and enhancing the cooperative research projects involving business and          industry and other educational institutions.                                                                                                                    The 5 year REDI plan will include major enhancements to existing                computing equipment, further updating the quality of the course                 offerings at JSU, as well as increasing computing capabilities of the           resource sharing institutions in the region.",
