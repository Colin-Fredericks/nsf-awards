 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research will determine which structural features of certain                hormones can be related to their biological activities.  The                    hormones to be studied are prolactin (PRL), and growth hormone                  (GH), and the related protein placental lactogen.  Fragments of                 the hormones will prepared by chemical and enzymatic cleavage and               they will be tested for receptor binding activity using membrane                preparations from various organs.  The same question will be                    addressed using a different approach.  Segments of these hormones               that are thought to be of functional significance will be                       detected using the techniques of site specific mutagenesis.  In                 addition, the amino acids in such segments of one kind of hormone               (e.g. a PRL) will be replaced by he amino acids in the same                     segment of the other kind of hormone (i.e. GH).  The mutant                     molecules will then be tested for receptor binding and biological               activities.  These hormones are involved in both normal and                     abnormal growth.  Information on their structural features will                 be of value in producing analogue that can block their action or                that have enhanced biological activities.",
