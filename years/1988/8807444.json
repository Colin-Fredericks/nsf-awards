 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program is concerned with the reaction chemistry of                   compounds containing metal-metal triple bonds. The structures                   and reactions of salts of the recently discovered                               octahalodiosmate(III) anions will be examined with a view to                    (a) establishing the steric and electronic factors that                         determine the rotational geometry within the anions and (b)                     using these compounds as starting materials for the synthesis                   of various mononuclear and dinuclear osmium compounds.                          Synthetic strategies will be developed for the preparation of                   triply-bonded dirhenium(II) complexes which contain bridging                    sulfur and arsenic ligands. The ability of the triply-bonded                    dirhenium core to undergo a 4-electron oxidation will be                        utilized in the conversion of dirhenium phosphine halide                        complexes into dirhenium polyhydrides and in the reductive                      coupling of alkyl and aryl nitriles to give metal-imido                         complexes. These reactions should constitute important                          synthetic strategies to such classes of compounds. The                          relationship between dirhenium(II) complexes with                               rhenium-rhenium triple bonds and hexanuclear trigonal prismatic                 rhenium(II) cluster compounds will be examined through attempts                 to synthesize and structurally characterize the latter.                                                                                                         Compounds containing metal-metal bonds continue to be of                        interest as catalysts and as precursors for alloys.",
