 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is designed to assess the importance of the early                   rearing environment in the development of the immune system.  It                will examine the development of immune function in two groups of                differentially-reared rhesus monkeys, and how that development                  might be affected by the interaction of psychosocial and                        physiological factors.                                                                                                                                          Physical development, behavioral maturation, and psychological                  status of the monkeys will be assessed and related to \"in vitro\"                immune measures, which will provide information on the                          development of the immune system, especially the \"T cells.\"  A                  series of vaccinations will provide an actual \"in vivo\" measure                 of the significance of the \"in vitro\" tests.                                                                                                                    This study has relevance to both animals and humans.  Current                   research in this new field suggests that the stresses, both                     physiological and psychological, associated with the differential               rearing may result in an increased susceptibility to disease, and               perhaps a long-term alteration in immune state.  In humans,                     there is evidence of a higher incidence of disease among children               who have experienced a traumatic loss or separation.  The role of               the early rearing environment in disease susceptibility is                      especially important because infants are increasingly being cared               for in day-care centers for long periods of time.  The results of               this important research will provide information on how to                      optimize the care and health of children.  In addition, the                     information obtained can be used to instruct zoos and research                  centers on how to provide the best rearing environments for their               animals.",
