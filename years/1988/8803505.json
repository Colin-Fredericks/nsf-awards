 "awd_abstract_narration": "By combining concepts coming from \"chaotic dynamical                       systems,\" differential geometry, and symmetry, a common                         mathematical foundation will be created to serve for several,                   seemingly different models coming rom the informational and                     decision sciences.  Such a foundation permits the transfer of                   ideas, concepts, and techniques among several different                         disciplines, and it leads to the development of techniques to                   solve issues that span the informational sciences.  The kinds of                problems to be addressed include the analysis of procedures from                voting and the decision sciences, techniques from probability and               statistics, as well as the design of mechanisms and incentive                   structures for economics.  The reason the results obtained in this              research will be interdisciplinary is that the emphasis is on                   characterizing the combinatoric symmetries of \"kinds of defining                properties\" for models as opposed to the particular properties of               a specific model.",
