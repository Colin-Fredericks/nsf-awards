 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fundamental approach to designing, testing, and manufacturing            electronic circuits has changed dramatically in the past decade.  This          undergraduate faculty enhancement project is intended to update                 university science and engineering faculty on the critical advances             that have taken place recently in the area of electronic circuit design         with the intent that participants will take this material back and              immediately build it into their curricula.  Phase one of this project           will be held at Michigan State University (M.S.U.), where participants          will receive intensive classroom briefings and gain laboratory                  experience with circuit design and circuit test equipment in the newly          completed Electronic Research and Development Laboratory (ERDL).                During phase two, participants will complete designs and prepare a              report back at their own schools.  During phase three, M.S.U. will              serve as a center of expertise and assist the participants as they              incorporate this new material into their curricula.  Included will be           at least one site visit to each participating university /college and a         one-day workshop at M.S.U.  Participants will be encouraged to keep in          touch with each other and with the faculty at M.S.U. via electronic             mail and other appropriate means to ensure that experiences gained can          be shared.  Seeking advice and sharing information will be encouraged           even after the formal project has ended.                                                                                                                           In addition to the NSF funds, participants' institutions will                contribute about 10% in travel funds toward the cost of the project.",
