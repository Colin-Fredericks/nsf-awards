 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adult suspension feeding fishes (e.g., anchovies and mackerels)                 capture multiple prey by swimming with mouths held open.                        Despite the economic and ecological importance of these fishes,                 few studies have tested hypotheses concerning the functional                    morphology, energetics, and hydrodynamics of suspension feeding.                As juveniles, these species are particulate feeders that capture                individual prey using suction.  The profound shift from                         particulate feeding to suspension feeding offers an ideal                       opportunity to investigate suspension feeding from a mechanistic                perspective.  The techniques of respiratory physiology and                      biomechanics will be applied to test two main hypotheses:                       first,that the hydraulic resistance of the water path through the               oral and opercular cavities, as well as the hydrodynamic drag of                the entire body during swimming with the mouth held open, is                    significantly higher in juvenile blackfish than in adults; and                  secondly, that the energetic cost of feeding decreases abruptly                 over the transition between feeding modes.  Although the                        energetic cost of suspension feeding may be low after the                       transition, physical constraints may prevent juveniles from                     suspension feeding.  Information on the factors involved in the                 switch between feeding modes will have implications for plankton                population dynamics, resource partitioning between juvenile and                 adult fishes, and the evolution of suspension feeding in fishes.                The University of California at Davis will serve as the host                    institution for this postdoctoral research fellowship project.                  The duration of this award is two years.",
