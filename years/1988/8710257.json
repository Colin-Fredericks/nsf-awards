 "awd_abstract_narration": "The physiology and anatomy of human cognitive processing are                    among the most complex and compelling problems in biology, owing                to a lack of a technique for measuring the activity of                          populations of cortical neurons within the intact human brain.                  Neuromagnetometry, a newly developed imaging technique, promises                a solution to this dilemma.  By measuring the magnetic field                    produced by brain electrical currents, it is possible to localize               the intracranial sources of these currents with millimeter                      precision.  However, the presence of contaminating environmental                magnetic noise has necessitated extensive signal averaging.                     Thus, the neuromagnetic study of the weak signals associated with               higher cognitive functions has remained a difficult problem                     because higher cognitive processes do not remain static for long                periods of time.  The solution is to reduce the background noise                through the use of a magnetically shielded chamber.  This                       proposal requests funding for the purchase of such a chamber to                 be used by investigators studying the neurobiology of cognition.                Specific research topics include early vision, early audition,                  language, and selective attention.",
