 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to show how the seasonal               effects of temperature on sex ratio are adaptive.  In a marine                  fish, the Atlantic silverside (Menidia), thermal effects on sex                 ratio result in females being produced earlier in the year than                 males.  Females tend to be larger than males at the end of the                  summer growing season, presumably because they have experienced a               longer growing season by virtue of earlier birth.  Large size                   appears to be more important to reproductive success in female                  than male silversides.  Dr. Conover will examine the related                    benefits of large size and longer growing period.  His approach                 is to compare the effects of length of the growing season on                    female and male body sizes among latitudinal populations of                     silversides that experience very different growing season                       durations.  In these populations the level of thermal control on                sex ratio is also known to vary.  He will also measure how                      populations alter growth rate in an attempt to compensate for the               differences in length of the growing season that occur with                     latitude.                                                                               The results of this study will greatly enhance our knowledge            of how environmental sex determination evolves.  It will also                   help us to understand how populations of a given species                        compensate for differences in length of the growing season.  This               information is important to fundamental ecological research.  But               it will also be useful in fish culture, where the ability to                    environmentally manipulate the sex ratio, or to select stocks                   from nature with the highest growth rate, would be highly                       advantageous.",
