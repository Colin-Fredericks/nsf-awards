 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is primarily concerned with distributed                   algorithms, particularly as they relate to the performance and                  reliability of distributed systems.  It is involved with the                    development of distributed algorithms that are based on the optimistic          paradigm.  Optimistic algorithms have been developed that particularly          address the issues of rollback and concurrency in the system.  The              proposed algorithms for replicated data significantly reduce the                latency incurred by transactions due to replica and concurrency                 control.  It is proposed to analyze and evaluate the performance of             these algorithms and to build a testbed in which these algorithms can           be implemented.  The goal is to develop a general framework that can be         used to synthesize optimistic protocols from their centralized                  counterparts.",
