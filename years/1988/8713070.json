 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes to continue his investigations into the underlying              principles that govern the dynamic behavior of chemical reactors by             studying unsteady state behavior.  His objectives are to gain insight           into chemical processes and to use the results as paradigms with which          the understanding of chemical dynamics can be advanced.                                                                                                         He plans to look at two systems: electrochemical and two-phase                  processes.  The modelling of the dynamics of electrodissolution of              metals can have various forms: one approach is to model the process             with ordinary differential equations derived from surface reactions on          the electrode surface while other models have as an intrinsic property          the diffusion through a film on the electrode surface.  The PI plans            to look at both types of models and experimentally determine the best           one.  He also plans to look at the dynamics of electrochemical                  reactions other than metal dissolution such as the electrochemical              catalytic reactions.                                                                                                                                            The dynamics of gas-liquid continuous chemical reactor systems will             also be  studied.  Reaction occurs in the liquid phase and one of the           reactants, normally oxygen, is absorbed from a gaseous phase.  The PI           plans to investigate the effect of reaction on the rate of mass                 transfer, and consequently, the interaction of enhanced mass transfer           with oscillatory behavior.  Mathematical models will be postulated and          then experimentally verified.",
