 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Gordon Conference has been organized with the theme \"Chemistry                of Electronic Materials\", and it will be held in Ventura,                       California, March 7-11, 1988.  The goal is to bring together                    industrial and academic scientists involved in various aspects of               electronic materials science and processing to discuss the                      fundamental issues in chemistry and engineering which are central               to the future development of this important area of technology.                                                                                                 In this third Conference on the \"Chemistry of Electronic                        Materials\", the emphasis of the first two meetings on                           silicon-based materials is somewhat reduced, with increased                     attention devoted to ceramic and polymer materials, chemistry,                  and process technology.  The sessions highlight developments in                 superconductive oxides, analysis techniques, novel conductor                    materials, polymer resist chemistry, chemical precursors for film               deposition, formation methods for materials, and interfacial                    chemistry.                                                                                                                                                      Major involvement of the academic chemistry and chemical                        engineering community in the Conference as speakers, discussion                 leaders and invited participants is anticipated.  In this way,                  academic interest in the topic can be stimulated and the                        conference can serve as a continuing focal point for the                        scientific issues that must be addressed to maintain the vitality               of this strategically important technology.",
