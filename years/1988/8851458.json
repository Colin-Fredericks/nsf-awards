 "awd_abstract_narration": "This department is introducing into undergraduate physiology,              biotechnology and molecular biology laboratories a set of new                   experiments that involve the isolation of the microsome component of            cell lysates and closed-circular, non-chromosomal DNA from bacteria.            The new ultracentrifuge procured through this project is used to                isolate the microsome fraction from cells of marine animals that have           been exposed to xenobiotics (artificially exposed in the laboratory or          exposed via polluted waters).  Students study the effect of xenobiotics         on the quantity and functions of the mixed function oxidase system, a           cytochrome p450.                                                                                                                                                In other experiments, students use ultracentrifugation to isolate and           characterize either large endogenous plasmids from Thiobacillus                 versutus or closed-circular DNA vectors carrying a variety of inserts.          (Such isolations nornally involve overnight centrifugation in cesium            chloride/ethidium bromide, with or without prior high salt/SDS                  treatment.)  An additional longer-term goal is for students in under-           graduate research projects to isolate from sucrose gradients E. coli            minicells containing the T. versutus plasmid.  In all cases the                 expertise and support materials had been available to do these                  projects, but a reliable ultracentrifuge was not.  The new equipment,           therefore, is facilitating useful and important curricular changes.                                                                                                  The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
