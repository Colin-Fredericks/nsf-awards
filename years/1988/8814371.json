 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many scientific and policy issues currently confront                            biotechnology research and development.  Some of these issues                   include the introduction of genetically engineered organisms into               the environment, federal and state oversight of biotechnology                   research, food adulteration by R-DNA techniques, biotechnology                  education and international outreach programs, and the patenting                of biotechnology products and processes.  It is proposed that a                 Committee on Biotechnology be established to advise the Board on                Basic Biology (BBB) on these issues and to provide a forum to                   mediate the multidirectional flow of information and technology                 transfer among industry, academe, and the public.  Under the                    direction of the BBB, the proposed committee will initiate                      relevant workshops, symposia, and studies.  The committee's                     activities will provide valuable information and guidance to                    government agencies, research scientists, and the public.  In                   addition, the committee would serve as the U.S. National                        Committee for COBIOTECH, which is a new international scientific                committee on biotechnology of the International Council of                      Scientific Unions.  It is proposed that the Committee on                        Biotechnology consist of approximately seven members selected for               the most part from sources such as the BBB, the Commission on                   Life Sciences (CLS), and the U.S. representatives on the                        COBIOTECH steering group.",
