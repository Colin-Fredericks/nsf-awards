 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides partial support for the summer school                  of the 1988 U.S. Particle Accelerator School.  The School                       offers graduate level courses in the physics and technology of                  particle accelerators.  The School will be held at Cornell                      University in August 1988.  The NSF contribution will be used                   to support the publication, in book form, of the lectures from                  the 1987 and 1988 schools.  NSF has already supported the                       publication of the 1987 symposium part of the school.                                Much of our knowledge of the microscopic structure of                      matter has been obtained from experiments with accelerated                      particles.  To reach new frontiers of energy and intensity, new                 acceleration techniques must be invented and developed.  This                   School is both a setting for such studies and, also, a facility                 for the maintenance of the scientific and engineering                           infrastructure necessary for the continuation of our present                    accelerators.",
