 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic and Macromolecular Program is supporting research                   dealing with the production of chemicals from blue-green algae                  that exhibit important and unusual biological properties.                       These microorganisms lie near the bottom of the food chain in                   marine systems, and, therefore, exert a strong effect on the                    course of life in the oceans.  The secondary compounds produced                 by these organisms often have strong effects on other species.                  This research is aimed at identifying these chemicals and                       attempting to understand how the producing organisms go about                   synthesizing such unusual chemical compounds.                                                                                                                   The first major aim of this project is to isolate and identify                  unusual, bioactive natural products that are found in cultured                  blue-green algae.  Research to date has concentrated mainly on                  the rapid-growing, relatively abundant cyanophytes found in                     terrestrial ecosystems and belonging predominantly to the                       Nostocales.  This research is focusing on the slower-growing                    and rarer blue-green algae, particularly those found in marine                  environments, for new leads.  Screening of extracts of the                      blue-green algae cultured to date for a wide range of                           pharmacological and agrochemical activities indicates that                      these prokaryotic microorganisms represent a good source of new                 commerical products.  Relatively little is known about the                      chemistry of secondary metabolites in blue-green algae.  Many                   extracts of cultured cyanophytes already on hand show                           interesting fungicidal, algicidal, antiviral, and other                         activities.  This research is concerned with studying the                       natural products that are responsible for these activities.                     The second area of research in this project is the study of the                 biosynthesis of natural products found in blue-green algae.                     Studies are being carried out on several potentially important                  classes of compounds that have been isolated to date, such as                   the hapalindoles and scytophycins.",
