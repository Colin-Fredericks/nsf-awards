 "awd_abstract_narration": "Downdrafts from mature convective storms have been shown                    to be important to a wide range of meteorological phenomena.                    For example, at smaller spatial scales, intense downdrafts                      have been shown to be a hazard to aviation (\"microbursts\")                      and to be very important in determining the nature and                          timing of new convective activity.  Over larger areas, it                       has been shown that incorrect parameterization of                               stormscale downdrafts in numerical models often leads to                        substantial errors in quantitative precipitation                                predictions.                                                                        The Principal Investigator will study the                                   characteristics and formation mechanism of local downdrafts                     in convective storms.  One area of investigation will be to                     test the hypothesis that downdrafts are initiated and                           controlled mainly thought melting and evaporation processes                     near the earth's surface.  He proposes that in response to                      low altitude downdrafts, entrainment aloft can be induced.                      This explanation differs from earlier studies which suggest                     that entrainment into convective storms at mid levels might                     be responsible for downdraft formation.                                             The Principal Investigator will use numerical modelling                     and previously collected observational data to accomplish                       his research goals.",
