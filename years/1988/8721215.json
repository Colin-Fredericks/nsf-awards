 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central problem in studies in science, technology and society                 concerns the relationships between technological changes and                    changes in attitudes and behaviors, values, and social policy.                  This research aims to monitor one set of such changes, namely,                  those associated with increased ability at genetic forecasting.                 Because these technological developments are relatively new, the                investigation can attempt to trace their impact on attitudes and                values from the beginning.  The proposed study will analyse three               interrelated developments: reporting about genetic screening and                related issues in the mass media; positions toward genetic                      screening taken by a variety of interest groups; and public                     knowledge, attitudes, and values related to genetic screening, as               measured by personal interviews with a national sample of adults.               The project allows 80 pilot interviews and one baseline survey of               a national sample, which can be repeated in future years.                       Developments in biotechnology and the way these developments are                communicated to the public will be monitored in selected mass                   media indexes as well as some specialized publications.  A small                social survey of potential interest groups likely to represent a                spectrum of views will also be undertaken.  Results of the                      project will be disseminated in published papers and public and                 professional presentations.  The data and associated materials                  will be appropriately archived.                                                                                                                                 This project addresses an important issue.  The principal                       investigator is very well qualified, as are her advisors.  It is                likely that follow-on efforts will continue after the period of                 this award.  The project is designed well and plans for the                     development, dissemination, and archiving of results are                        appropriate.  University support is good.  An award in the total                amount of $144,871 is recommended.  Of this amount, $75,000 will                be made available immediately.",
