 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science for Science Teachers features a four-week summer                        institute for 50 underprepared middle school/junior high                        school science teachers.  The topics to be treated are                          representative of all the major science disciplines.  There                     is a strong emphasis on laboratory experiences.  The staff of                   the project include university research scientists and high                     school science teachers, all of whom have participated in                       similar programs during three previous years.  Distinguished                    guest lecturers are used frequently.  Instructional                             materials, both reading matter and laboratory apparatus, have                   been developed and tested in earlier years and are now                          available for use during the 1988 summer institute and in the                   classrooms of participants in subsequent years.                                                                                                                 The participants are drawn from all parts of the United                         States.  They maintain contacts with each other and with                        project staff through newsletters and reunions that are                         arranged in connection with National Science Teachers                           Association meetings.  Strong group rapport has been                            characteristic of this project in previous years.                                                                                                               Costs of the project are shared by the Lawrence Hall of                         Science and the participants' home institutions.  These                         contributions total 8% of the amount invested by the National                   Science Foundation.",
