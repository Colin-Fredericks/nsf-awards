 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry                      Program, will study the spectroscopy and photodissociation                      dynamics of dissociative electronic states of polyatomic free                   radicals.  This study will elucidate the reactivity and                         photochemistry of the prototypical species studied.                                                                                                             Initial studies will focus on small well characterized radicals                 such as triatomic species containing carbon, nitrogen and/or                    oxygen.  The knowledge gained in these studies will be utilized                 in the study of more complex species, including organometallic                  radicals containing one or more coordinatively unsaturated                      transition metal atom.  A fast mass-selected beam of internally                 cold radicals is generated by negative ion photodetachment, and                 the fragments produced by photodissociating the radicals are                    detected.  The energy dependence of the photodissocation cross                  section will be determined for each radical, followed by                        photodissociation dynamics studies at selected excitation                       energies in which photofragment energy and angular distribution                 are measured.",
