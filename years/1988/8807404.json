 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central aim of this research is to provide a critical                  reappraisal of so-called empirical \"laws\" for trophic structure                 in ecosystems.  The first whole-system data base designed                       specifically to represent the trophic structure of a large-scale                ecosystem will be assembled.  Efforts will be focused on Little                 Rock Lake, Wisconsin.  This represents a long-term study site                   where much of the desired information has already been gathered                 and where a research team has agreed to collaborate to resolve                  the trophic structure of the system.  The protocol for this                     study will involve an extended visit to the field station                       associated with the lake in order to coordinate the resolution of               feeding relations within and between the major subsystems                       involved.  The initial focus will be on the aquatic environment                 because it represents the largest fraction of the systems upon                  which the food web laws are based, and because the chance of                    constructing reasonable complete food webs is likely to be                      highest here.  These data will represent at lease an order of                   magnitude improvement over what is currently available in the                   food web literature.  Among the details that will be included in                this study are:  a full and more even-handed resolution of                      species involved and their feeding intensities; temporal                        variability in food web structure with season and ontogeny; the                 magnitudes of energy and material flows in aggregated webs;                     interaction strength; the effects on food web patterns of                       studying incomplete subsystems; and the variation in food web                   structure with the systematic incorporation of major to minor                   interactions.  Among the specific questions that will be asked is               how representative of real systems are the data upon which many                 food web generalizations are based?  Here, credible data from the               documented systems will be used to statistically test whether a                 large collection of questionable data are to be believed.",
