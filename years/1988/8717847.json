 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a study of how a native prairie perennial               plant is able to persist in an oak savannah woodland developed on               a sand plain.  The project is based on the notion that                          explanations of persistence are affected by the spatial scale                   under study.  The study species for this project is Penstemon                   grandiflorus (Scrophulariaceae) a plant native to midwestern sand               prairies and savannahs.  Specifically, it is proposed to                        determine how Penstemon persists at three spatial scales:  the                  plant neighborhood, individual openings in the savannah/forest                  complex, and the overall landscape.  The way in which, pocket                   gophers, and processes associated with succession interact to                   affect the persistence of this species at the three different                   scales will be examined.  Small experimental plots will be used                 to test hypotheses involving persistence at the scale of the                    neighborhood; larger long-term observation plots will be used to                test hypotheses regarding successional dynamics of openings; and                aerial photography and computer mapping will be used to test                    hypotheses at the landscape level.",
