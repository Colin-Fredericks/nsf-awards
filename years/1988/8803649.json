 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to further the                                understanding of the structure and function of the                              photosynthetic membrane system in the evolutionarily                            \"primitive\" prokaryote, Chloroflexus aurantiacus.  The                          relative simplicity of its reaction center and light-                           harvesting antenna systems make Chloroflexus an excellent                       model system for the study of photosynthetic energy capture                     and the genetic regulation and assembly of its photosynthetic                   apparatus.  These experiments are a continuation of previous                    work defining the architecture of the photosynthetic                            apparatus.  In addition, a series of experiments applying                       recombinant DNA techniques will isolate genes encoding the                      photosynthetic apparatus in Chloroflexus.  These isolated                       genes will be used for analyzing both the structure of the                      photosynthetic apparatus and its regulation of assembly.                                                                                                        Application of recently developed genetic techniques has                        resulted in new approaches for studying regulation of                           assembly of bacterial photosynthetic membranes.  Such                           experiments have largely confirmed the observations of                          earlier workers, in that assembly responds to light and                         oxygen levels.  The exact mechanisms for this control have                      not yet been clarified, but it is clear that several                            photosynthetic components are under separate regulatory                         control.  Current information indicates three levels of                         regulation.  One regulatory mechanism appears unique to the                     Chloroflexus photosynthetic apparatus: post-translational                       protein processing.  This mechanism may be involved in                          regulation of chlorosome assembly.  Such a processing                           mechanism predicts that the several chlorosome polypeptides                     are encoded on a single message, translated into a single                       polypeptide, then cleaved.  The genetic analysis proposed in                    this project will provide a direct test of the protein-                         processing hypothesis by determining the structure of the                       genes encoding the chlorosome polypeptides.",
