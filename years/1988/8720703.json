 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mylonite zones exposed within the granulite facies terrains                of the Ivrea-Verbano zone, northern Italy, and the Bergen Arc,                  western Norway, provide examples of fault zones in the lower                    continental crust of extensional and compressional regimes,                     respectively.  Within the Ivrea zone, the shear zones occur as                  mylonites of the Pogallo fault zone and as high temperature shear               zones in the granulite domain of Valle d'Ossola.  Deformed                      ultramafic rocks are also important constituents of deep                        structural levels of the Ivrea zone.  Mylonites in the Bergen Arc               are superimposed on an anorthositic complex and are characterized               by an eclogite facies mineralogy.  The research investigated the                seismic properties of rocks from the these zones in order to                    evaluate the hypothesis that mylonite zones cause deep crustal                  reflections.  The main phases of the work are 1) a sampling                     program in both regions; 2) investigation of preferred mineral                  orientations in the mylonitic rocks; 3) thin section and                        geochemical study of the composition of samples; 4) determination               of the elastic constant tensor by measurement of P- and S-wave                  velocities at confining pressures up to 600 MPa; 4) construction                of hypothetical velocity profiles through deformed and undeformed               sequences.",
