 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polyhydroxbuytyrate (PHB) can be produced by many bacteria by                   fermentation and can be easily obtained in quantity.  It                        would be an excellent thermoplastic; it lacks toxicity and is                   biodegradable.  However it is too crystalline and brittle                       which has hindered its commercial potential.  It is, however,                   possible that these PHB biosynthetic enzymes could be used to                   make alternate polyester materials with improved properties.                    Thus it is planned to dissect the important and fundamental                     mechanism of how this class of biological molecules are                         assembled.  It will be necessary to clone (or move) the three                   genes in the biosynthetic pathway.  The genes will be                           sequenced, appropriate vectors will be constructed and the                      resulting three enzymes, thiolase, acetoacetyl CoA reductase                    and PHB synthase, will be purified to homogeneity.  The                         regulation of the three genes will be studied and each                          purified enzyme characterized structurally and functionally.                    The ultimate objective is to shed light on the unexplored                       mechanisms of biological polyester formation of PHB                             analogues.  This is an ideal team to conduct this                               investigations.
