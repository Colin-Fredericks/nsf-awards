 "awd_abstract_narration": "Measurements of the density matrix for collisionally                       produced H atoms for electron transfer collision of H+ on He                    will be continued.  By fully modeling the collision region and                  calculating the transition amplitudes of the Stark-mixed                        hydrogenic states, the n=3 density matrix with 14 independent                   parameters, associated with the newly formed hydrogen atoms,                    can be fit to the measured signals.                                                  Significant improvements in the measuring apparatus and in                 the analysis associated with the fit of the density matrix to                   the optical signals will be utilized in the further                             measurements.  The resulting changes have so far produced                       measured values of the density matrix that are in striking                      agreement with theory, for the most part.  Important                            differences do remain, and further tests and extension are                      warranted-especially for the n=2 manifold and for the                           differential measurement.  Because of significant, recent                       advances in atomic theory the measurement program is now                        directed toward a detailed understanding of differences and                     similarities between the calculated density matrix and the                      measured one.",
