 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports collaborative research between teams of US and              Chinese ecologists, geochemists, and palynologists on the study of              sedimentary histories of selected lacustrine ecosystems of the                  Yunnan Plateau in southwest China.  Cores collected from five Yunnan            lakes will be studied to determine rates of ecosystem response to               natural and anthropogenic stresses.  Measurements will be made of               changing rates of accumulation of aquatic and terrestrial,                      biological and chemical fossils between isotopically dated levels in            lake sediments.                                                                                                                                                 This part of China is well known for its floristic similarity to the            southeastern US.  It is also one of the world's oldest centers of               intensive agriculture.  Through this cooperative project, it is                 hoped that our understanding of the environmental consequences of               agricultural, industrial, and urban development will be improved.",
