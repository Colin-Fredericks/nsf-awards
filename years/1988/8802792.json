 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lawrence Markus will carry out investigations into                         stochastic differential equations and into the control of hybrid                systems in infinite dimensional state spaces. The former work                   arises from a formulation of relativistic Brownian motion as a                  stochastic dynamical system on a manifold. These are in turn                    related to geodesic flows which will be the focus of Markus'                    attention in this area. A hybrid system is a combination of a                   system such as an elastic beam governed by a partial differential               equation and a rigid body governed by an ordinary differential                  equation. This combination will be controlled by boundary                       controllers acting only in the rigid body. Investigations such as               these are important because of their applicability to the problem               of controlling large scale space structures.                                         George Sell will work on inertial manifolds for nonlinear                  evolutionary equations, functional differential equations with                  feedback, spectral properties of linear evolutionary equations,                 and chaotic behavior for the perturbed sine-Gordon equation.                    Inertial manifolds are currently being investigated by many                     researchers with the aim of using them to investigate the global                attractors of nonlinear dissipative evolutionary equations.                        Markus and Sell will be joined by Yuncheng You, who will work                with them principally in the areas of control of large space                    structures and control theory of differentiable manifolds.",
