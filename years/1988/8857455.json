 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Presidential Young Investigator Award from the Inorganic,                  Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program will support                  research in biologically relevant inorganic chemistry.  The                     emphasis of the project will be the elucidation of the role of                  metal ions in important biological transformations.  Of                         particular interest is the participation of transition metal                    ions in the terminal steps of the reduction of dioxygen by                      cytochrome oxidase and the evolution of oxygen by the                           photosynthetic apparatus.  Small molecule analogs of the metal                  centers of these and other metalloproteins, especially                          manganese-containing proteins, will be synthesized and                          characterized.  The general strategy to be taken will involve                   the design and synthesis of organic ligands, preparation and                    purification of their complexes with transition metals, and                     thorough characterization of such systems by a variety of                       structural, magnetic, and spectroscopic techniques.  In                         addition to the systems mentioned above, others of interest                     include the magnetically-coupled siroheme and iron-sulfur                       cluster in sulfite reductase, and the participation of nickel                   in hydrogenase and methanogenesis activity.  Finally, the role                  of low valent vanadium in catalyzing the conversion of                          dinitrogen to ammonia and hydrazxine will be explored.                                                                                                          Comparison of the spectroscopic and chemical properties of the                  model compounds is expected to yield valuable insight into the                  detailed workings of the modeled biological systems.",
