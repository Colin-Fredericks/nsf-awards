 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tourism is a world-wide phenomenon that is affecting third                 world peoples, their views of themselves, and how they present                  themselves to outsiders, as well as how outsiders view them.                    This study will look at this process and see especially how                     anthropologists have affected local socio-economic organization                 and local knowledge about prehistoric and modern cultures.  It                  will also analyze how anthropological knowledge, in turn, is                    incorporated into interactions between hosts and tourists.                           For this project the student will work in the Maya town of                 Piste, Mexico and will study the effect of anthropologist S.G.                  Morley's archaeological work at the site of Chichen-Itza and see                how this has affected the development of tourism in Yucatan.                         This study will contribute to an understanding of how                      anthropology is a social institution that has historical effects                on the peoples it studies.  This study has the potential to                     influence the way anthropology is done in the future by showing                 the unexpected side-effects and spin offs of the basic research                 endeavor.",
