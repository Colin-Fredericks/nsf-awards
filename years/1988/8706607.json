 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Laboratory of Anthropology of the Museum of New Mexico              holds a significant assemblage of ethnographic objects from the                 American Southwest.  Based on a comprehensive conservation needs                survey, the museum staff has identified irreplaceable, perishable               ethnographic artifacts that are rapidly deteriorating.  These                   include baskets, objects of wood, leather, and rawhide.  Many of                these cannot be safely handled due to their deteriorating                       condition, and hence are unavailable for research.                                      Conservators will be hired to preserve and stabilize the                most damaged objects.  Staff will repair, remove mold and the                   effects of pollution, build protective mounts and containers, and               improve storage units.                                                                  The objects to be conserved are part of one of the largest,             best documented, and most significant, systematic collections in                the country.  They are an almost complete reference collection                  for groups living in the American Southwest and northern Mexico.                As such, they are invaluable for anthropological research.",
