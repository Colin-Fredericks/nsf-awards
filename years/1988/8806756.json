 "awd_abstract_narration": "In-depth experimental and theoretical studies of the role of                    hydrogen in semiconductor single crystals, the purest and                       structurally most perfect materials, will be made.  Important                   scientific and technical information has been gained recently                   from the study of many hydrogen-containing impurity and defect                  complexes in silicon, germanium, and gallium arsenide.  The plan                is to investigate the formation and detailed structure of some of               these complexes.  Recent IR spectroscopy information on                         partially hydrogen-passivated multivalent acceptors indicates                   the existence of both static and dynamic centers.  Information on               electrically non-active centers on the other hand is very                       limited.  They will make use of local vibrational mode                          spectroscopy, together with uniaxial stress, to determine the                   structure of fully passivated dopants.  Raman and EPR                           spectroscopies will be used in special cases.  Modelling and                    calculations for various configurations will be proposed and                    carried out in close comparison with the data.                                  In a parallel effort an investigation of various hydrogen-                      introduction mechanisms will be made.  Hydrogen RF plasmas,                     electrolysis and chemo-mechanical polishing all seem to lead to                 hydrogenation and associated dopant passivation.  Attempts will                 be made to verify recent conjectures and theoretical calculations               that give the hydrogen charge state as a function of the                        semiconductor Fermi level.  Various theoretical mechanisms will                 be examined in connection with these experiments.  Results should               be of significance for many processes in semiconductor                          technology, such as plasma deposition, etching, oxidation, and                  ion implantation.  Most of these processes involve, intentionally               of unintentionally, hydrogen.  An improved understanding of its                 role in semiconductors is necessary for the successful                          development of future silicon and gallium arsenide based devices.",
