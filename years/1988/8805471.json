 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. D'Altroy and colleagues have conducted excavations at                       archaeological sites located in the Upper Mantaro Valley in the                 highlands of Peru.  In particular, they focussed on two cultural                periods:  Wanka II which dates from ca. A.D. 1350-1460 and Wanka                III, from 1460-1553.  During the earlier phase, the Wanka                       societies were organized into warring chiefdoms with large                      communities serving as population and political centers.  During                Wanka III times, however, these groups were pacified and                        incorporated into the Inka empire.  Settlements were shifted to                 lower unfortified locations, and presumably, political                          organization was altered.                                                                                                                                       A new second phase of field research is based on these prior                    results.  Excavation will focus on both Wanka II and III sites to               collect data on the transformations that occurred in the                        political economy of the Wanka region as a result of imperial                   occupation.  Sites will include one indigenous Wanka center each                from Wanka II and III, an Inka provincial capital, and a                        subsidiary Inka settlement.  The excavations will focus on public               and elite architecture.  Analyses of recovered materials - plant                remains, animal bones, ceramics, lithics, metals, and textiles -                will provide information on imperial administration, the                        subsistence support for elite institutions, and the                             political/ceremonial relations between conqueror and conquered.                                                                                                 This research is important because it will provide insight into                 how large political organizations are formed and how powerful                   urban elites relate to rural subjects.  This distinction exists                 today and characterizes many nations in the developing world.                   The political and economic problems faced by many nations, such                 as the Philippines, are influenced by just such factors.                        Archaeology is useful in such a context because it provides an                  excellent long term perspective.",
