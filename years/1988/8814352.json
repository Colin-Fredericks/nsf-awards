 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Artic regions are playing an increasingly important national                role in the search for resources (petroleum and minerals), living               space, and environmental and social development.  Although an                   active science research effort exists, there is a need to develop               an agenda for academically based basic engineering research.                    Engineering disciplines can contribute research that will provide               solutions for problems in cold regions in the areas of                          geotechnical, mining, prtroleum, structural, naval architecture,                transportation, acoustical, electrical, mechanical,                             environmental, instrumentation, coastal, particularly, materials                and ice engineering.  The proposed workshop will address the                    needed research projects, instrumentation and facility                          development, university, industry, government liaison and                       interaction, information transfer to the engineering design                     community, and effective education and training needs.                          Participants from universities, professional societies,                         interdisciplinary groups, government agencies (federal and                      state), design companies, resource industries will attend the                   workshop.  Workshop participants will review three recent                       pertinent reports that broadly identify research needs, develop a               strategy appropriate for the the university environment, and help               prepare a final report.",
