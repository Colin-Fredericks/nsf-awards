 "awd_abstract_narration": "The wider use of enzymes in organic syntheses, where their high degree          of regio- and stereo-selectivity is difficult to achieve with                   conventional catalysts, is severely hampered by the low aqueous                 solubility of many substrates of interest.  The encapsulation of                enzymes in reverse micelles, which provides a method for stabilization          of the enzyme, is a new and particularly promising approach for                 biological synthesis or transformation of organic compounds in organic          solvents.  This project concerns fundamental studies for the                    development of new bioreactors employing such encapsulated enzymes.             It includes a study of the effect of encapsulation of dopamine beta-            monooxygenase, a non-specific enzyme which hydroxylates ring-                   substituted phenethylamines, alkenes, aldehydes, amides and sulphides.          The effect of micelle structure on the conformation of the enzyme is            studied by use of ESR and kinetic measurements.  A molecular-                   thermodynamic model, relating the properties of the aqueous miniphase           to prevailing conditions, is also developed.                                                                                                                    The use of reverse micelles to protect the enzyme from the often                denaturing influence of organic solvents is a new approach to enzyme            stabilization.  Current research has focussed on the use of reverse             micelles for protein purification.  The inner water pool of a reverse           micelle can solubilize large protein molecules and the micelle                  provides a large surface area for transport of reactant and substrate           to and from the enzyme.  Little is understood of the behavior of                enzymes within such micelles or of how their kinetic properties differ          from enzymes in solution.  The investigators create micelles using              non-polar surfactants, so that transport of polar organic substrates            can be enhanced by the addition of carrier molecules in the organic             phase, such as quaternary alkyl amines.  There is current interest in           describing the behavior of water in reverse micelles from a phase               equilibrium thermodynamic viewpoint.  Of even greater importance is             the development of a molecular-thermodynamic model to relate the                properties of the aqueous miniphase to the external conditions, so              that a predictive model can be employed for bioreactor design.",
