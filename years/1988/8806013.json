 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research                   Equipment for the Mathematical Sciences program of the Division                 of Mathematical Sciences. It is for the purchase of special                     purpose equipment dedicated to the support of research in the                   mathematical sciences.  In general, this equipment is required by               several research projects, and would be difficult to justify for                one project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation                is coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers,                 and with substantial cost-sharing from the institution submitting               the proposal.  This is an instance of university, industrial, and               government cooperation in the support of basic research in the                  mathematical sciences.                                                               The equipment in this project will be used in research                     projects in mathematics and statistics.  The specific projects                  include Applications of Fast Fourier Transforms to Stochastic                   Flow Equations, Research in Reliability using Restricted                        Empirical Bayes Estimation, Research on Graph Enumeration                       Algorithms, Solution of Quasi-linear Parabolic Partial                          Differential Equations, and Research in Multivariate Quality                    Control.",
