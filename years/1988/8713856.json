 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for the participation of nine               U.S. engineers in a seminar with counterparts from the Federal                  Republic of Germany (FRG) that is designed to identify generic                  research needs that impede the full development of important new                iron and steel making processes.  The seminar co-organizers are                 Professor H. Alan Fine, Department of Metallurgical Engineering and             Materials Science, University of Kentucky, and Professor                        Hans-Juergen Engell, Director of the Max Planck Institute for Iron              Research, Duesseldorf.  The U.S. delegation will consist of senior              academic engineers, a few younger faculty members and two engineers             from industry.  Representatives from the Department of Energy have              also been invited.  The agenda for the meeting places particular                emphasis on (1) the kinetics of fine particle reaction in fluid                 media, (2) containment of slags rich in FeO, (3) refining of Cu and             other tramp elements from steel, and (4) heat and mass transfer                 considerations associated with novel processing.  Participants                  nominated for the workshop are well qualified to discuss                        developments in their fields and to identify useful future research             directions and technological opportunities.                                                                                                                     The U.S. iron and steel industries are being challenged to develop              new processes in order to become more competitive in the world                  market.  In particular, they must make use of available raw                     materials and resources in the most economical manner.  Alternatives            to the use of coke in ironmaking, new processes that take advantage             of fine-grained feed materials produced from processing low-grade               ores, more efficient use of scrap metals, and effective and                     economical methods for the removal of impurities found in scrap and             in low-grade coals are examples of areas where more research is                 needed.  The U.S. and the FRG are actively involved in the                      production of iron and steel and are making significant research                efforts aimed at developing new technologies.  The proposed seminar             will bring together eminent workers in this field from the two                  countries for a mutually beneficial exchange of information to chart            areas of new research and possible cooperation.",
