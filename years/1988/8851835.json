 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project introduces bold changes to the introductory-                  level computer science course at this institution, a course                     patterned on the recommendations of the ACM Curriculum '78                      guidelines.                                                                          Unlike traditional courses that concentrate almost entirely                on the teaching of a third generation programming language, the                 new course first has the students solve complex problems using                  fourth-generation application specific languages. They then                     progress through database and graphics concepts utilizing a real-               time data acquisition laboratory experience. The course includes                the teaching of a third generation programming language but                     comprehensive user-friendly tools drastically shorten the time                  needed for students to achieve a high level of programming                      proficiency.                                                                         The laboratory environment that supports this project                      includes:   MAC II workstations, connected by AppleTalk local                   area network software and hardware, a dedicated MAC II                          fileserver, an Imagewriter LQ printer, and, instrument interfaces               to connect the configuration to digitizers, A/D-D/A converters,                 graphic printers and plotters.                                                       Students in this course achieve a broader understanding of                 the capabilities of computers and gain valuable experience in                   exercising these insights on problems of a more useful and                      realistic scale than is possible in most introductory courses.                                                                                                       This award is being matched by an equal sum from the                       grantee.",
