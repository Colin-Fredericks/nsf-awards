 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes to study the local structure and magnetic                       properties of rare earth amorphous alloys over a range of                       temperature from approximately .05K to room temperature or                      above, principally using the Mossbauer effect.  The original                    experiments will be extended to other non-magnetic metal                        constituents such as aluminum and gallium, and then to the more                 complicated amorphous systems with the magnetic transition                      metals, which are of technological interest.  As a microscopic                  probe yielding angular information about the arrangements of ions               and magnetic information about individual rare earth ions, the                  Mossbauer effect is well suited for such studies.  Experiments                  over the range of temperature proposed here will yield                          information about crystalline electric field parameters, exchange               fields, and distributions of these, to be compared to various                   models of amorphous structure such as dense-random-packing-of-                  hard-spheres or random network models.  These results are                       anticipated to make a significant contribution to the developing                field of amorphous structure and magnetism.  The proposed                       research is also expected to have a major impact on the                         educational environment of the Physics Department at Franklin and               Marshall College by continuing the increased amount of active                   experimental research on campus, and by continuing the                          collaboration with Stanford University and contacts with the                    University of Pennsylvania and Temple University.",
