 "awd_abstract_narration": "Benthic bacteria are increasingly perceived as the most important               component of benthic carbon cycles, yet little is known about benthic           bacterial activity in polar marine basins.  Deming proposes to                  evaluate benthic bacterial processes and fate of organic matter in the          faunally rich Greenland Basin, and the oligotrophic Norwegian Basin.            Specific topics to be addressed include:  1)  bacterial biomass and             distribution, and comparisons with temperate basins of similar depths;          2) rates of use for labile dissolved organic carbon, production of              extracellular enzymes to hydrolize more refractory carbon sources, and          growth at the sub-zero temperatues and elevated pressures of these              arctic basins; 3) bacterial use of sediment organic carbon                      compared with total benthic demand, and comparison of benthic                   bacterial significance to carbon cycles in polar basins and in warmer           basins; and 4) extent to which bacterial community structure, sub-zero          temperatures, and elevated pressures determine rates of bacterial               activity in polar basins.  Results will be evaluated within the                 context of total benthic biological carbon utilization.  Overall                results will provide important information on the fate of organic               carbon and new insight into the constraints that temperature and                pressure place on bacterial activity in high-latitude and deep-sea              environments.",
