 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this research are to develop systematic synthesis                  procedures and short-cut evaluation techniques for the conceptual               design of multiproduct and multipurpose plants which involves                   breaking the problem down into a hierarchy of abstraction spaces,               where each level in the hierarch contains more detail than the                  level above it but less detail than the level below it.  The most               important features of the solution are considered first, then the               solution is developed by adding layers of less important details                to the partial solution that was developed at previous levels.                  The PI uses this techniques and has already shown that decisions                made at lower levels in the hierarchy never reflect back on                     earlier decisions eliminating the problem of conflict resolution.                                                                                               A systematic procedure for synthesizing petrochemical processes                 where multiple products are produced simultaneously but where the               market demand does not correspond to the product distribution                   produced in a single pass through the reactor (e.g. glycols and                 amines) would be a very valuable process design tool.  Similarly,               in some cases it might be advantageous to produce more than one                 product by different chemical routes in the same equipment, where               each product is made for only part of the year.  Multipurpose                   plants often, but not always, run in a batch mode are needed for                such operation.  The third category of problems to be addressed                 in this project is the design of plant complexes, i.e. the design               of processes to produce reaction intermediates, and then use the                intermediates to produce a final project.  The development of all               of these algorithms would be valuable not only because a more                   efficient design procedure would be available but also as                       teaching tools for the instruction of design to undergraduates.",
