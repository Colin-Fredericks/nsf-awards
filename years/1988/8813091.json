 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for an international                        conference and related projects at colleges and universities on                 isses in science, technology, and ethical responsibility.  The                  theme of these projects is \"New Challenges Posed by Global                      Interdependence.\"  They will examine ethical and value issues                   raised by global interdependence in four areas: environmental                   science, bioengineering, information science, and global                        security.  The conference will bring ninety outstanding students                from diverse disciplines and nations together with leaders of                   varying perspectives in academia, government, industry, and non-                profit organizations.  Conference participants will prepare                     research papers, to be published in academic and professional                   journals, which will serve as the focus of small working group                  discussions during the week of the conference.  The conference                  will also feature plenaries by national figures.  In conjunction                with the conference, Student Pugwash chapters, currently active                 on forty-three college and university campuses, will sponsor                    educational events -- symposia, roundtables, lectures, debates,                 and an ongoing electronic conference -- on issues in global                     interdependence.  An evaluation will be developed and conducted.                Private foundation and corporate sponsors will provide over two-                thirds of the funds for this effort.                                                                                                                            The scope and organization of this activity are highly                          meritorious; it has evolved into a truly unique national, even                  international, student educational effort on science, engineering               and social responsibility.  The institutional sponsor has an                    excellent track record.  Matching support has been received and                 will continue to be received from several corporate and private                 foundations.  For the first time, a campus chapter program has                  been linked to the conference, and an evaluation is being                       planned.  These project components have great potential to                      augment and improve what has been a very successful endeavor.                   Support in the amount of $128,772 is awarded.",
