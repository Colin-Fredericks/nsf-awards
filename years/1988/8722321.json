The symposium is held every two years                  and is sponsored by the American Society for Testing and                        Materials (ASTM), Committee E10 on Nuclear Technology and                       Applications.  It addresses fundamental and technological                       aspects of radiation damage.  It is followed by a series of                     subcommittee meetings with full international representation to                 develop consensus standards for materials to be used in nuclear                 power generation.  Participation by Indian scientists will lead                 to an increased amount of collaboration with U.S. scientists,                   especially since it is planned to invite them to visit various                  U.S. national laboratories and universities as part of their                    trip.  Proceedings are to be published in hardbound books and                   are subject to rigorous scientific peer review.                                                                                                                 Scope:  Indian scientists participation is likely to benefit the                working of the symposium.  They will be selected based on the                   quality and relevance of their independently submitted                          abstracts, and to ensure broad participation of the Indian                      nuclear materials community.  The selection will be made by the                 P.I. and by the symposium Vice Chairman, with help from Dr.                     Kanwar Krishan of the Indira Gandhi Center for Atomic Research                  in Kalpakkam, Tamilnadu, India who is a member of the Program                   Committee.",
