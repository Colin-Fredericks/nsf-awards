 "awd_abstract_narration": "Decisions often must be made when the outcome of the decision                   process is not known but can be specified by some probability of                occurring.  The analysis of decision-making under such conditions               of uncertainty has become a major focus of research in animal                   behavior.  The decision process is influenced by two factors:                   the benefit to the organism from a particular outcome (say, a                   certain quantity of food) and the probability of that outcome.                  Most research to date has examined the manner in which organisms                assess and weigh benefits, but little attention has been paid to                how organisms assess and construct probabilities.  A considerable               amount of empirical evidence suggests that people systematically                make biased estimates of probabilities.  We consistently believe                that low-probability events are more likely and high-probability                events are less likely to occur than they actually are.  People                 seem to homogenize probabilities, making all events seem more                   equally likely than they actually are.                                                                                                                          Dr. Real's research will determine the degree to which animals                  (in this case, white-footed deer mice) show the same kind of bias               in their assessment of probabilities.  Such systematic bias would               have profound consequences for our ability to interpret                         experiments on behavior.  Dr. Real has developed a means of                     independently establishing the organism's subjective perception                 of probabilities.  By allowing mice to choose over different                    experimentally derived probabilities, he can construct the                      subjective probability that accounts for the pattern of observed                choice behavior.  In this way he can partition the dual factors                 influencing decision-making.  He may also be able to say                        something about the common cognitive structures that constrain                  behavioral choices in humans and animals.",
