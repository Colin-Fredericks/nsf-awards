 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research has as its aim the synthesization and study of the                solid-state properties of homogeneous ion-conducting polymer-                   electrolyte complexes as well as composites of polymers with                    heavy metal, radiopacifying salts.  The project focuses on two                  broad objectives:  1) the synthesis, mechanism of formation, and                characterization of comb-like homopolymers and block copolymers                 of polysiloxanes and other polymer with oligo-oxyethlene side                   chains, including those in which the anion of the conducting salt               is covalently bound to the polymer, and 2) the synthesis of                     homogeneous polymer-salt complexes or mixtures in which the salt                is added either to effectuate ion-conduction or to impart                       radiopacity to the polymer.  The properties of these polymer-                   salt composites will be studied by a variety of techniques                      including FTIR, NMR, small-angle X-ray scattering, electron                     microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, conductivity, and                radiology.  The investigations are designed to clarify                          relationships between the ionic conductivity or radiopacity of                  the polymer-salt composites and their morphology, to evaluate                   salt effects on mechanical properties and to determine how                      polymer-salt compatibility is affected by interionic and ion-                   polymers interactions.                                                                                                                                          The solvent-free polymer electrolyte complexes are potentially                  useful as flexible, plastic electrolytes in rechargeable solid-                 state alkali batteries.  Resins in which heavy-metal salts are                  solubilized or immobilized on the polymer matrix are of                         importance in the development of X-ray contrast or radiopaque                   materials useful in applications such as dental resins, medical                 implants, or plastic fireweapons where rapid imaging is                         important.",
