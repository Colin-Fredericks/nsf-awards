 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is the final year of a three-year airborne geophysical             survey to obtain magnetic and gravimetric data within the continental           margins and basins surrounding the Antarctic Peninsula.  The project            is a joint effort between the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory             and the Naval Research Laboratory, which will provide an instrumented           P-3 aircraft in support of the project.                                                                                                                         The present project is based on prior work in the 1985/86 and the               1986/87 austral summer seasons, in which about 150,000 km of                    geophysical data was obtained in a series of flights covering much of           the previously unsurveyed western Weddell Sea Basin and the Bransfield          Strait.  Preliminary results from that field work have defined a                fossil subduction zone bordering the Powell Basin, a magnetic anomaly           typical of an ocean-continent transition extending from Jurassic                volcanic sequences on the Lassiter Coast, and a symmetric anomaly               pattern in the Bransfield Strait.  The present field work will                  concentrate on acquiring magnetic data in the Scotia Basin, and                 carrying out a magnetic and gravity survey of the western                       Bellingshausen margin.                                                                                                                                          The airborne surveys have been designed to produce an efficient and             rapid geomagnetic picture of the peninsular sector and its eastern and          western margins.  Much of this area is normally covered by ice and is           inaccessible to ships, therefore the project will provide data that             could not otherwise be obtained.  The NRL P-3 is specifically designed          to support geophysical research and is an excellent long-range                  platform for this project.  Results from this work will improve our             understanding of the relative motions of tectonic plates and the                interpretation of the geology of the Antarctic Peninsula, and provide           constraints on the time of opening of the Drake Passage and the                 evolution of southern ocean circulation patterns.",
