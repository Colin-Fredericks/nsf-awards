 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering design has increased in complexity to the point where               interactive computing has become an indispensable part of the design            cycle.  Even with computers, design can be very difficult when it               involves the selection of many interdependent parameters.  this is a            proposal for continued research on a general purpose, optimization-             based computer-aided-design methodology which will supplement and               eventually displace many heuristic design techniques.  Such a                   methodology is possible because a large variety of engineering design           problems are transcribable into the form of a very small number of              standard, semi-infinite optimization problems and because new system            theoretic results facilitate the use of optimization in engineering             design.  The proposal is in three parts:  the first deals with                  optimization algorithms for engineering design, the second one deals            with topics in optimization-oriented system theory, and the third one           deals with the development of an interactive software system which              provides an appropriate environment for optimization-based computer-            aided design.",
