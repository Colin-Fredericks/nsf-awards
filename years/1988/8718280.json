 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of stellar clusters in the galaxy M33 has provided much               information concerning the stellar cluster system itself,                       chemical evolution of the disk and some kinematics. This survey                 will be extended to deeper limits taking advantage of the                       quality of observing conditions on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.  Deep                     luminosity functions of clusters will be obtained as clues to the               formation and cluster dissolution processes occurring in M33.                   The wavelength range will be extended to the Ultraviolet (UV)                   band and to the near infrared (IR) wavelength using arrays to                   obtain improved reddening, age and metallicity estimates for a                  larger sample of clusters.  The region of the brightest open                    clusters in the disk will be probed.  High spatial resolution                   cameras will be used to resolve the fields at the best quality                  offered at ground-based facilities.  Spectroscopy will be used to               study the kinematics of the cluster system and to calibrate the                 metallicity estimates.                                                                                                                                          The stellar content of M33 will be examined as well, using the                  same data taken to survey the clusters.  The variation of the                   stellar population from place to place in the disk will be                      investigated.  Coupled with the metallicity gradient seen in M33                traced by HII regions and the clusters, the age-metallicity and                 population variations across the disk will be unveiled.  The                    proximity and inclination of M33 allows optimal sampling of                     parameters that provide constraints for galactic structure and                  evolution theories, in contrast to studies of M31 and the Galaxy                which are severely restricted by extinction.                                                                                                                    The M33 samples will be compared to data for the Small Magellanic               Cloud (SMC) and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to understand how                  much of stellar and cluster evolution is determined by the parent               galaxy.  Continuing the M33 study to fainter magnitudes                         achievable from the ground permits a smooth transition from the                 \"brighter\" surveys (V=14-20) currently published to fields                      selected for Hubble Space Telescope (HST).  The ground based                    studies will be used to choose the \"most profitable\" fields for                 space observations.                                                                                                                                             Stars in other galaxies, sampled at only the brightest fraction                 of the population, will be measured using existing data.  Blue,                 violet, ultraviolet, red and infrared protometry will be                        obtained.  Characterization of the properties of the stellar                    content of Local Group galaxies, as they vary within each galaxy                and from galaxy to galaxy, will be used to understand the                       integrated properties of more distant systems.",
