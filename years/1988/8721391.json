 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Geomagnetic Reversal Time Scale is now one of the most                 useful and firmly established components of chronostratigraphic                 correlation, at least for times younger than mid-Jurassic.  Over                the past 10 years, significant extensions of this have been made                to earlier times by studying the magnetostratigraphy of well-                   dated, fossiliferous strata in multiply-overlapping sections.  We               propose to extend our existing studies over the next 3 years to                 the Precambrian-Cambrian, Cambrian-Ordovician, Ordovician-                      Silurian, and the Silurian-Devonian.  Although a long-range goal                of these efforts is to determine whether or not it is possible to               establish a zone-by-zone magnetostratigraphy for the entire                     Paleozoic, the period boundaries are logical places to start due                to the intensive efforts of biostratigraphers searching for global              boundary stratotype sections.  These boundaries often correspond                to times of great evolutionary diversification and/or extinction,               and results from the proposed work could find immediate                         application in measuring the isochrony of extinction and proposed               global climatic events, as well as verifying the utility of                     carbon-isotopic stratigraphy.",
