 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between                          Professor Ponisseril Somasundaran of the Henry Krumb                            School of Mines, Columbia University, New York, and Dr.                         B. Cabane, Solid-State Physics Laboratory, University                           de Paris-Sud, France, on the subject of mechanisms of                           colloid formation and dispersion.  Small angle neutron                          scattering (SANS) will be applied to the study of                               colloidal aggregates at the sub-micron size level, with                         the intent of determining dimensions and growth                                 characteristics of aggregates, and on the thickness of                          submicronic adsorbed layers.  By improving our                                  understanding of the mechanism of colloidal dispersion,                         the development of a basic theory of colloidal                                  aggregation may be brought closer to realization.                                                                                                               The expertise of the U.S. and French groups is                                  complementary.  The U.S. group has considerable                                 experience in the study of aggregate formation in                               mineral oxides, and in the solution chemistry of this                           and other systems; the French collaborator has                                  considerable experience in SANS, and its application to                         polymer/micelle interactions.  Through previous visits,                         the French collaborator is familiar with the equipment                          available in the U.S. researcher's laboratory.  The                             proposed cooperation provides the U.S. researcher with                          an opportunity to use equipment and techniques for SANS                         not readily available to him in the U.S.  This work                             could have important applications in such industrial                            processes as water treatment and mineral processing.",
