 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over a three-year period, this program will refine, implement, and              evaluate a four week intensive summer enrichment program in pre-algebra         skills for eighth grade students who are in transition from elementary          to high school.  One hundred students will participate for each of three        summers. It is based on a unique, successful experimental class held            during the summer of 1987.  The program is a collaborative effort               involving scientists, engineers, and mathematicians from a number of            local industries who will demonstrate practical applications of math in         the work place. Students will be bused to nearby locations for on-site          demonstrations as part of the program.  In addition, faculty from               Arizona State University will provide information on careers in                 science/math/technology as part of the partnership program.                                                                                                     Student interest in mathematics, knowledge of careers in                        science/math/technology, student achievement in science and math and            enrollment in upper division science and math courses are predicted to          increase as a result of implementation of the  proposed program.  An            extensive evaluation component with longitudinal tracking of students is        included in the model.  Also included in the model for transfer to other        teachers and other school districts are ways to organize and operate            such a program, and information on successful instructional practices           and materials.                                                                                                                                                  Cost sharing by the corporate and educational partners will total 43% of        the NSF funding.",
