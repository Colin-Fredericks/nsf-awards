 "awd_abstract_narration": "The sorting of proteins to lysosomes is studied because this is                 presently the best understood sorting process.  Upon arrival in                 the Golgi complex, newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes acquire a                mannose 6-phosphate (man6P) moiety that enables these enzymes to                bind to man6P-specific receptors.  The man6P receptor-enzyme                    complexes are then delivered by transport vesicles to an acidic                 prelysosome, where the enzymes are released; the man6P receptors                then return to the Golgi complex for another round of transport.                The biochemistry of this delivery process is being studied by                   reconstituting the vesicular transport of the man6P receptor from               prelysosomes back to the Golgi complex in a cell free system.                   Now the project will define the molecular components that are                   used by the cell to form transport vesicles, target them to a                   specific destination, and enable them to fuse.  Since almost                    nothing is known about the molecular components that facilitate                 intracellular transport, it may be possible to identify new                     proteins that mediate this vesicular transport process.                                                                                                         To streamline operations, eukaryotic cells have devised a set of                compartments that carry out specialized tasks, and therefore must               be supplied with a unique set of proteins.  The goal of this                    research is to understand, in molecular terms, how cells                        establish and maintain distinct membrane-bound compartments.                    This will lead to an understanding of the molecular mechanisms by               which proteins are targetted to specific intracellular                          estinations.",
