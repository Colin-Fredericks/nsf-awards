 "awd_abstract_narration": "The areas of cellular/molecular biology and physiology are                 becoming increasingly difficult to teach because of the rapid advance           of knowledge and the technical methodologies they employ.  Compounding          the already difficult task of instruction is the students' lack of              understanding of how to investigate physiological systems.  These facts         lead to the two main objectives addressed in the present effort to              improve instruction in the affected laboratories:  (1)  To give                 students experience with suitable equipment in order to develop their           understanding the behavior of physiological systems (using an                   instrument not only develops a student's lab skills; it encourages the          development of a sophisticated understanding of the concept or system           which can't happen in any other way).  (2)  To provide the student with         a laboratory experience that is investigative in nature.                                                                                                             In order to accomplish these objectives, the cellular/molecular            and physiology labs are being restructured by developing three                  different types of labs; Concepts-Skills, Inquiry, and Investigative            labs.  These facilitate the exploration of topics in the lab which              previously could be pursued only in lecture.                                                                                                                         The above changes are intended to:  1) increase the student'               understanding of the conceptual framework upon which a physiological/           cellular/molecular investigation is based;  2) increase the students'           ability to work with the type and quality of data gathered in cellular/         molecular and physiological investigations;  3) develop in the students         a sense of inquiry, understanding and appreciation of the functional            aspects of cellular/molecular biology and physiology; and  4) increase          the students' own investigative abilities.                                                                                                                           The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
