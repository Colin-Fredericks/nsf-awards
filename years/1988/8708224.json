 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a very broadly ranging project in which Dr. Bullock and  colleagues will continue his long history of studies on systems through which various cold-blooded vertebrates, primarily fish, detect and interpret sensory information and how this leads to specific forms of behavior.  The Principal Investigator is recognized as the outstanding contributor to this field.  The studies focus on several major themes.  One is the question of how stimuli are filtered, encoded and recognized by the nervous systems of these animals.  Another is the important issuarative importance of serial and parallel processing of information at various le central nervous system.  A third is the relation between the organism's habitatical implications as well as theoretical importance to the understanding of evolutionary processes.  All of these are highly significant to our understanding of the workings of neural systems and there is every reason to anticipate that the project will lead to major advances.                                                                                                                          The methods that will be used are primarily electrical recordings of neural activity, although some behavioral and some anatomical work is also to be conducted.",
