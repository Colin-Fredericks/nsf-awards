 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine the nature of nutrient limitation at                  the level of ecosystem function.  The hypothesis that the degree                of nutrient limitation in an ecosystem depends not only upon the                fertility of the site but also upon the responsiveness of the                   vegetation that occupies the site and upon the potential of soil                microorganisms to immobilize nutrients will be tested.  The                     response to nitrogen addition in two nitrogen-limited ecosystems                (tundra and boreal forest) will be examined.  Field experiments                 will determine the growth response of vegetation to large and                   small levels of nitrogen addition and the degree to which added                 nitrogen is immobilized by micro-organisms or absorbed by plants.               Laboratory experiments will determine the potential of plants and               soil microorganisms adapted to differing soil fertility to absorb               nutrients.  The extent to which soil microorganisms are energy-                 vs. nutrient-limited in ecosystems of different fertilities and                 the way in which changing energy/nutrient limitation affects                    nutrient immobilization or release will also be determined.  The                research should improve basic understanding of the nature of                    nutrient limitation in ecosystems and may provide insight into                  the question of why some ecosystems are so much more responsive                 to fertilization than are others.  The latter question has                      considerable economic importance.                                                                                                                               The University of ALaska Taiga research group is excellent and                  highly productive.  Facilities for the work are quite well                      developed as is the science administration environment provided                 by the Institute of Arctic Biology.                                                                                                                             The Ecosystem Studies Program enthusiastically recommends that                  this now three-year continuing award be made.",
