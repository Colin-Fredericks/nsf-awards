 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mechanical quality factor (Q) of low-loss metallic                     alloys and elements will be studied at temperatures from 50 mK                  to 4 K and at a frequency of about 1 kHz.  Material selection                   will be based on anticipated suitability for use for ultralow                   temperature Weber-bar gravity wave detectors.  The currently                    favored material for planned detectors is aluminum 50-56 alloy,                 but alternate materials exhibit superior bondability, thermal                   conductivity and density.  There are practically no ultralow                    temperature Q-data on these materials, and it is urgently                       needed to assess their suitability for constructing large-scale                 detectors.  Qs will be obtained from the measured time                          constants of decay of free vibrations of small mechanical                       resonators mounted in a dilution refrigerator cryostat.                         Materials to be investigated include copper alloys, aluminum                    alloys, and transition element metals.  Experimental studies                    will emphasize careful metallurgical characterization and                       systematic elimination of extrinsic contributions to measured                   quality factors.  In addition to supporting gravity wave                        detector development, it is expected that the results will                      contribute to the fundamental understanding of mechanical loss                  mechanisms in metals at ultralow temperatures.",
