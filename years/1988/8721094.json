 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carbonate skeletons of plants and animals are the major                   components of marine carbonate sediments.  The chemical and                     mineralogical compositions of these skeletons both control responses of         skeletal material to and act as tracers for monitoring diagenetic               processes.  Although water (liquid and bound inorganic H2O and OH-) is          the second or third most abundant component of carbonate skeletons,             little is known about the different phases present, their abundances,           or how these different phases affect or are affected by diagenetic              alteration, even in skeletons of the most important sediment-producing          taxa.  The goals of this research are to study the interactions between         intrinsic water in carbonate skeletons and early diagenetic processes.          The first object of the work will be to quantitatively characterize the         water content of skeletons of living representatives of major framework         and sediment producing taxa.  Amount of water present, the phases in            which it occurs, and the abundances of these phases will be related to          skeletal mineralogy, chemistry, and microstructure, and to taxonomy.            The second phase of the work will examine interactions of early                 diagenetic processes with the forms and abundance of water in fossil            skeletons of these same taxa, and the ways in which early changes in            abundance and form of water affect the subsequent diagenetic alteration         of these skeletons.",
