 "awd_abstract_narration": "The tumorous head phenotype (masses of abdominal and genital                    tissue arising where the eye ought to be) in Drosophila                         melanogaster is produced by the interaction of the maternally                   acting tuh-1 locus with the zygotically acting Tuh-3 mutation                   in the following fashion. In progeny of tuh-1+ femalesTuh-3                     produces no observable phenotype.  Progeny of tuh-1- females                    are normal in phenotype unless they are also homo- or                           heterozygous for Tuh-3.  Tuh-3 progeny of tuh-1- (loss of                       function) mutant females have the tumorous head phenotype.                      Tuh-3/Tuh-3 (but not Tuh-3/+) progeny of females carrying the                   dominant naturally occurring tuh-1g allele have normal heads,                   but have defects in the development of derivatives of the                       genital disc.  The effect of the Tuh-3 thus depends on the                      maternal genotype at the tuh-1 locus.  TheTuh-3 mutation is                     apparently caused by an insertion of a Delta-88 element into                    one of the most distal sites in the Bithorax Complex (BX-C),                    and presumably causes its effects by disrupting the                             regulation of the expression of this part of the BX-C.  The                     work proposed here is to elucidate the molecular mechanism of                   the unusual interaction between tuh-1 andTuh-3 by addressing                    two issues.  First tuh-1 will be cloned and the clones will                     be used to obtain information about the nature of the                           product encoded by this gene, about its developmental time                      and place of appearance, and the differences among products                     encoded by wild type, loss of function, and g alleles.                          Second, reversion and DNA lesion mapping studies are planned                    to determine whether the interaction takes place via the                        Delta-88 element in the BX-C, or via regulatory sites near                      the site of this insertion.                                                                                                                                     This is a study of a very unusual interaction between two                       genes, in which the developmental defect caused by a                            particular mutation at one gene in a fly is very different                      depending on which form of a second gene was present in the                     mother of that fly.  The first gene is a member of the                          Bithorax Complex, a set of genes which determines the                           segmental identities of the thoracic and abdominal segments.                    In order to ensure proper identities for each segment, the                      genes in this complex are regulated in a very precise and                       complex pattern, the details of which are still being worked                    out.  The mechanism of this regulation is still obscure,                        although it is clear that interaction with other genes                          outside the complex is involved. Interactions among                             developmentally important genes are an important, and as yet                    poorly understood, component of the mechanism by which such                     genes bring about the development of the pattern of an                          organism.  This study should shed light on how such                             interactions take place.",
