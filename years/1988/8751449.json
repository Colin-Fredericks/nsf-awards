 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is a collaborative effort of four colleges ( Georgetown           University, Canisius College, University of San Francisco, and Seattle          University) to incorporate biotechnological concepts and laboratory             experiments into high school science curricula, particularly biology and        chemistry.  The project is an outgrowth of a successful teacher                 enhancement project at Georgetown University under the leadership of Dr.        Chirikjian in the area of biotechnology.  Teachers and college                  scientists at the three other institutions participated in the 1987             summer program at Georgetown in preparation to serve as lead teachers           and project directors in their areas in this project.                                                                                                           During the Georgetown project, a laboratory kit and reagents were               developed to facilitate conducting the key experiments in high school           science classrooms.  In addition, during this project, a set of key             technique videotapes will be developed to assist teachers in                    implementation efforts.  Participating teachers have assisted in the            design refinements of the kits and reagents to assure their most                effective use in high school classrooms.                                                                                                                        Georgetown University staff will provide staff and materials support to         the satellite colleges in the initial years of the project.  School             district and local private sector support will augment NSF funding in           the implementation of the project.  The project will be fully                   implemented in each of the satellite colleges during the period of this         project and plans will be developed for the continuation of appropriate         project related activities after NSF funding ceases.                                                                                                            This project is worthy of funding because of the importance of                  incorporating this important area of science into high school                   classrooms, the kit and reagents being developed specifically for the           high school audience, the model of dissemination and cooperation among          colleges and universities on a national level and the commitment of the         PIs and teachers to continue the project activities at the conclusion of        the project.",
