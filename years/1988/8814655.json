 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work develops, tests, and uses a turbulent combustion                      model that accounts for far-from-equilibrium effects,                           including local extinction.  The starting point of the work                     is the modelled transport equation for the joint probability                    density function (pdf) of velocity and compositions.  In                        previous work this equation has been solved by a Monte Carlo                    method to calculate the properties of a near-equilibrium                        turbulent diffusion flame.  In order to be able to account                      for far-from-equilibrium effects, this pdf approach is                          extended in two respects.  First, an improved mixing model,                     that accounts for the effects of reactions on mixing, will be                   developed, tested, and incorporated.  Second, a four-step                       scheme for methane/air combustion will be incorporated.                                                                                                         Some important phenomena in diesel-engine combustion and in                     gas-turbine combustors are associated with far-from-                            equilibrium effects.  Examples are ignition, blow-out,                          relight, and the emission of significant amounts of CO and                      unburnt hydrocarbons.  Although this research deals                             specifically with turbulent flames, success will have an                        impact on related problems that span the wide spectrum of                       turbulent fluid mechanics.  Improved turbulence                                 modeling would have, in turn, an impact on propulsion systems                   (internal combustion engines, rockets, and turbines), on acid                   rain (both in formation of species and their subsequent                         dispersion throughout the environment), disposal of toxic wastes,               semiconductor and superconductor fabrication techniques, and                    medical science, to cite a few.",
