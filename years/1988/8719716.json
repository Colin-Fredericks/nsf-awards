 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proper development of auditory function requires a complex                  interaction of nerve cells within the central nervous system with               sensory cells of the peripheral organ.  The cochlea is the                      peripheral sensory organ in the inner ear which perceives                       mechanical vibratory impulses that are transferred as sound                     stimuli by cochlear neurons, the spiral ganglion cells.  The                    auditory impulses reach the brainstem of the central nervous                    system via afferent fibers of the auditory nerve.  The brain stem               in turn sends the efferent innervation to the organ of Corti to                 provide the fine sound discrimination and to lower the noise                    background.  It is believed that efferent innervation modulates                 the sensitivity of the sensory cells to sound by releasing the                  chemical, acetylcholine.  Little is known about the development                 of these cholinergic (acetylcholine-releasing) efferents or their               molecular properties.  The P.I.s' research concerns the                         development of the enzymes choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), and                acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and its molecular forms, which                      respectively synthesize and breakdown acetylcholine.  Their data                suggest that in the mouse the cholinergic efferents are present                 throughout the organ of Corti at birth.  Postnatal increases in                 the levels of AChE molecular forms correspond to the time of                    innervation of inner and outer hair cells.  We propose to use                   biochemical, histochemical and immunochemical techniques to study               the amount and distribution of cholinergic enzymes in the                       efferent fibers along the spiral and radial axes of the                         developing organ.  The goal of this work is to determine the                    effect the normal developmental time course for the cholinergic                 innervation of the hair cells has on the expression of synaptic                 and non-synaptic AChE molecular forms.  The research  will                      determine the time when cholinergic efferents establish contacts                with their targets, the morpological and molecular nature of                    these efferents along the cochlea, and indicate the cellular                    interactions necessary for morphological and molecular synaptic                 differentiation to occur.  The research will help identify the                  causes and consequences of normal and abnormal auditory                         development.",
