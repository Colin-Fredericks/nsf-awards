 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program is concerned with the chemistry of the                        so-called post transition elements, which include selenium,                     tellurium, arsenic and tin. Anionic clusters of these elements,                 i.e. clusters of atoms with negative charges, have been known                   for some time, but little is known about the chemistry of these                 clusters. The focus of the project is the reactions of these                    clusters with transition metals, such as chromium and niobium,                  to form a variety of unusual new mixed-element clusters. The                    new species are of interest because they are soluble precursors                 of new materials, and because they pose interesting challenges                  to existing bonding theories.                                                                                                                                   The reactions of post transition element cluster anions, such                   as the triselenide, the tetratelluride and the nonastannide                     ions, with transition metal complexes will be investigated. The                 goal is to prepare new cluster anions containing both                           transition and main group elements. Strategies will be                          developed for stabilizing the cluster anions in solution, such                  as the introduction of carbon as a heterovertex atom. For the                   preparation of the target clusters the reactions of main group                  anionic clusters with transition metal halides and with a                       variety of organometallic compounds will be investigated.",
