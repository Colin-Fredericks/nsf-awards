 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support ongoing collaborative research in applied               mathematics between two groups of U.S. and French scientists, based             at the University of Maryland and at the French National Institute              for Information Science and Automation (INRIA).  The U.S. group                 will be led by Professor Ivo Babuska; on the French side the                    project will be led by Dr. Michel Bernadou, INRIA - Rocquencourt.               The University of Maryland and INRIA have been working for many                 years on finite element methods for the numerical solution of                   partial differential equations that arise in engineering problems.              INRIA has developed the software system MODULEF; new theoretical                approaches and related computer implementations have been developed             at the University of Maryland.  Hence the French and U.S. groups                complement each other.  The major objectives of the proposed                    collaboration are:                                                              a) To develop a scientific framework characterizing the relevant                   properties of existing methods which can be used for the                        assessment of their effectiveness in practical computations, and                to design new effective methods.                                             b) To assess the accuracy of computed results and the                              design of adaptive procedures.                                               c) To develop new mathematical formulations of important                           engineering problems, with special attention given to problems                  for which the available information (input data) has intrinsic                  uncertainties.                                                                                                                                               This research joins two groups of outstanding U.S. and French                   applied mathematicians.  INRIA is widely recognized for its                     concentration of expertise in computer research, automation,                    mathematics and scientific computing; it provides an excellent                  combination of fundamental research with industrial collaboration               in these areas.  This award will allow fruitful collaboration to                continue in the important area of finite element theory and                     applications.",
