 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this 2 year study of the interfacial and mechanical           properties of Carbon-Carbon Composites are:  (1) to find effective              surface treatments and de-treatments which would lower the chemical             bonding and increase mechanical bonding and interfacial coefficient             of friction; and (2) to determine the correlation between surface               functional groups and the mechanism of load transfer from fiber to              matrix, interfacial bond strength and fracture toughness.  The fiber            surface treatments will include oxygen, argon plasma etching and                nitric acid treatment.  The surface characteristic of treated and               untreated fibers will be determined using Electron Spectroscopy for             Chemical Analysis and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy.  The             C-C composites will be produced using both treated and untreated                fabrics.  All the composites will be analyzed using electron                    microscopy, destructive and non-destructive mechanical testing.  The            resulting mechanical properties will be correlated with the surface             properties of the fabrics.  This study will answer the fundamental              question related to synergetic mechanism of the matrix by employing             weak chemical bond, mechanical bond and high coefficient of                     interfacial friction.  In addition, the results of this research will           assist in the optimization of mechanical properties of C-C                      composites, increasing their chances for wider technological                    applications.",
