This               program will provide significant content and pedagogical training in            physics for 16 high school physics teachers, and similar training in            physical science for 16 junior high school teachers.  Teachers selected         for the program will participate in a series of three six-week summer           workshops together with academic year follow-up activities.  Graduate           credit will be available for each summer workshop completed.  The               workshops are intended to equip the participants to serve as resource           teachers in physics or physical science in their schools and school             districts.  Albany State College is a traditionally black institution.          This program is expected to serve substantial number of minority                teachers.",
