 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year cooperative research project in              solid state physics between Professor George Gruner, Department of              Physics, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and Professor            Karlheinz Seeger, Institute for Solid State Physics, University of              Vienna, Austria, and the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Solid State             Physics, also in Vienna.  The scientists and members of their research          groups will study electrical conductivity properties of certain                 inorganic materials which show so-called charge density wave transport          phenomena.  Microwave harmonic mixing and microwave rectification               experiments will be performed at various frequency values and over a            broad range of temperatures and electric field values.  One aim is to           distinguish between phenomena which can be understood on the basis of           classical descriptions and those for which a quantum approach is                necessary.  The model compounds to be studied in this research will be          prepared by Professor Gruner and his research group at UCLA.  The               microwave measurements will be performed in Vienna, where Professor             Seeger's group pioneered the technique of microwave harmonic mixing.            These results, when combined with those from related measurements made          at UCLA, should contribute significantly to a better understanding of           the charge density wave transport phenomenon.                                                                                                                   The fundamental studies to be carried out in this cooperative effort            are expected to add importantly to our understanding of electron                interactions in solids.  This in turn could lead eventually to the              design of new electronic materials and devices.  The Austrian microwave         techniques to be employed in this research will also be applied by              Professor Gruner and his group to other research problems under                 investigation in their laboratory.",
