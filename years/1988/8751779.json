Lawrence Hall         of Science, in conjunction with New York Hall of Science, will conduct          two three-week summer institutes and develop a series of Guides to the          Active Planetarium to support teacher's efforts in conducting inservice         workshops and fully utilizing planetariums to supplement classroom              instruction. During the two year period following the NSF funding cycle,        participants will have follow-up meetings at major science teacher              conferences with funds provided by Learning Technologies, makers of             portable planetariums.",
