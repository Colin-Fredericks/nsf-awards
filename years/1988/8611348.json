 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to improve the quality of polymeric extrudates            and to characterize their mechanical properties, particularly those             intended for high strength and profile applications.  To achieve                this goal the principles of streamlined die design as developed for             solid state extrusion of metals will be explored and applied to                 polymers.  Finite element techniques will be used to analyze both               the flowing material and the die deformation.  Characterization of              polymers for conventional extrusion and melt transformation                     coextrusion will be conducted, with the results confirmed or altered            by observation in a side viewing die designed to accommodate                    sculptured surface inserts.  This work should lead to a die design              methodology for these types of polymeric materials.  This research              should result in an improved extrusion process for polymers and a               scientific understanding of the melt transformation coextrusion                 process.  Application of these materials is expected in aerospace,              medical, automotive, and other applications requiring high strength             to weight characteristics.",
