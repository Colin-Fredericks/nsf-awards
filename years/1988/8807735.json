 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to identify and characterize                        the functions present in the PColV.K30 REPI region that                         are associated with control of its replication.  This replicon                  is part of a replication.aerobactin iron.transport unit that                    we found to be conserved in plasmid carrying the aerobactin                     iron-transport system genes.  The REPI replication region                       endows the cells with incompatibility properties corresponding                  to the IncFI group and must have been instrumental in the                       preservation and epidemiological spread of the aerobactin                       iron-transport system.  Although it is a replicon frequently                    found in bacterial plasmid, little is known on the                              mechanisms controlling its replication and the mechanisms that                  result in the expression of the IncFI incompatibility                           phenotype.  The following experiments are being performed:                      1.  Analysis of the product(s) involved in the control of                       replication of REPI containing plasmid.                                         2.  Characterization of a trans.acting protein RepI which is                     necessary for REPI replication, and its mechanism of action.                   3.  Elucidation of the role of the novel incompatibility                        region incF and the already known incE in the mechanisms of                     REPI incompatibility that result in the IncFI phenotype.                                                                                                        Dr. Crosa's work on this bacterial plasmid to date                              hasestablished the overall framework of the elements                            replication, and the proposed future work deals with further                    elaboration of the features he has found.  Understanding of                     how this replicon functions will certainly advance our                          understanding of plasmid replication and compatibility between                  different plasmid.  In addition this study may improve our                      understanding of how these plasmid spread and are maintained                    in bacterial populations.",
