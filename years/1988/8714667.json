 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several investigations will be carried out with the common aim of               confronting current ideas in theoretical physics and physical                   cosmology with observations.                                                    *Theoretical studies will be made of gravitational lensing effects              of cosmic strings.  These studies will be used to implement a                   systematic search for cosmic string lens candidates in a digital                sky survey database.  Candidate systems will then be submitted to               a battery of additional observational screenings.                               *Theoretical investigation will be made of line emission and line               profiles in models of high-redshift clouds producing absorption                 lines in Quasi-Stellar Object (QSO) spectra.  An observational                  search for their line emission will be made and used to put limits              on the high-redshift Ultraviolet (UV) background.                               *Models will be made of various sources of small-angle anisotropy               in the microwave background and applied to recent detections at                 the Very Large Array (VLA).  New observations at a higher radio                 frequency will be made at the VLA to distinguish between these                  models.                                                                         *Theoretical models will be studied of the effect of                            inhomogeneities from cosmic phase transitions on cosmic                         nucleosynthesis.  A critical evaluation will be made of the range               of cosmic baryon densities compatible with observations.",
