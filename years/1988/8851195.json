 "awd_abstract_narration": "The new chromatography curriculum is exposing all of the chemistry              majors and many additional students to GC employing temperature                 programming, capillary columns, TCD, FID, and GC/MS; and to HPLC                utilizing normal phase, reverse phase, ion and GPC columns; isocratic           and gradient elution; and UV, fluorescence, conductivity, and                   refractive index detection.  These students are gaining experience in           the use of computers for data collection and analysis.  They are                increasing their ability to use computers to prepare formal scientific          reports incorporating the analyzed data.  In addition to the 2 HPLC's           (one a gradient system), a GC/MS, and several student model GC's                previously available in the department, this project has added a dual           column, microprocessor controlled gas chromatograph with temperature            programming and capillary column capability, a refractive index                 detector for HPLC, and a PC based chromatography data station.  Thus,           the experiments in seven courses and student-faculty research is                extending the students' understanding and appreciation of                       chromatography as a tool for a wide variety of applications as well as          giving them experience using computers and computer controlled                  instrumentation for chemistry laboratory applications.
