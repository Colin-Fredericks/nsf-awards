 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support a policy workshop on Federal support                  of research into exceptional abilities, including such                          phenomena as photographic memory, lightning calculation,                        genius, creative altruism and extraordinary systematic                          transformations.  This workshop, primarily for Federal science                  policy officials, will follow on a larger, public symposium on                  this topic being sponsored by the Institute of Noetic Sciences.                 The primary focus of the discussions at the NSF-supported                       workshop will be sources of funding and research agenda for                     exceptional abilities research.                                                                                                                                 Outcomes of the workshop will include a published report of the                 proceedings, an overview of current research in this area now                   being supported by the government, and recommendations                          concerning the next steps various agencies and organizations                    might take to advance research in this area.                                                                                                                    The Institute of Noetic Sciences is a public foundation whose                   purposes are to promote scientific research on the mind and                     human potentials, and to explore the application of that                        research in health, education, business and other fields.  They                 are well qualified to organize this workshop.",
