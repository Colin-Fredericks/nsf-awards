 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Dr. Ronald D. Anderson, University of                    Colorado, Boulder, and three other U.S. educational researchers to              collaborate with Dr. Uwe Hameyer, Institute for Science Education,              University of Kiel, Federal Republic of Germany, and three other                researchers from the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland.  They will           compare the implementation of elementary school science programs in             the five home countries of the researchers.  The project is being               coordinated from the Institute for Science Education in Kiel.                                                                                                   The goal of the research is to study the process of putting quality             elementary school science programs into practice and to identify the            conditions that foster or restrict their successful implementation.             The study will be conducted in a variety of settings where attempts             have been made or are being made to implement and institutionalize              activity-based elementary school science programs.  Each of these               countries has developed good curricular materials for science                   teaching, but has had difficulty in consistently implementing or                maintaining activity-based elementary school science programs.  An              ethnographic approach will be used in case studies in the five                  countries; this should provide information not usually obtainable               from surveys.  Dr. Anderson and Dr. Hameyer have successfully                   collaborated on previous research on science education.  The other              members of the research group offer important skills and access to              the diverse school populations required for the project.",
