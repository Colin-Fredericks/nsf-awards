 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides the base funding for the first year of a                    five-year Presidential Young Investigator award. The research                   is in the area of organometallic chemistry and focuses on                       light-induced reactions of compounds containing multiple bonds                  between the metal atom and one of the surrounding ligands.                                                                                                      The research will consist of two projects. In the first of                      these, photochemical reactions of high-valent organometallic                    complexes containing multiple metal-ligand linkages will be                     investigated. Of particular interest are photochemical                          reactions of complexes in which the metal has two d electrons                   and is either triply bonded to a nitride ligand or doubly                       bonded to either an alkylidyne or an alkylidene ligand. The                     lowest-lying electronic excited states of these species, which                  are pi-antibonding with respect to the multiply bonded ligand,                  should facilitate reactions at these moieties. The second                       project will involve the synthesis and physical                                 characterization of heterobimetallic compounds in which the                     metal centers are joined by an inorganic substrate. Emphasis                    will be on the reactions of electronically unsaturated early                    transition metal complexes with compounds of the later metals                   containing a ligand which can serve as a bridge to the early                    transition metal. Specifically, the reaction of 16-electron                     hydride complexes with electronically saturated complexes                       ligated by dinitrogen, carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide should                 yield dimers with these ligands as bridges.",
