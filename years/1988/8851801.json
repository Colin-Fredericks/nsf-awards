 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microcomputers are being interfaced with laboratory instruments in the          general chemistry program.  Student involvement is being maximized in           the process of measurement, data acquisition, and data analysis.  The           efficiency and precision of laboratory measurements is being increased,         as well as the student interest and understanding of the nature of the          measurements and the principles of chemistry that the laboratories are          designed to illustrate.  Four data acquisition devices, eight                   microcomputers directly connected to the devices, a hard disk drive and         tape backup for software and data storage as well as a fileserver               system are included.  Each data acquisition device serves two student           workstations.  The workstations were completed with the purchase of:            eight digital balances for routine mass measurements, three bomb                calorimeter systems for calorimetric studies of foods and fuels, two            spectrometers for routine quantitative analyses as well as equilibrium          and kinetic studies, four pressure transducer systems and eight                 thermistor thermometer systems for temperature measurements.                                                                                                    The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal funds.",
