 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animals that are fed different, nutritionally adequate, diets                   often grow at different rates.  This is commonly attributed to                  differences in diet palatability (taste and smell), but there is                no evidence substantiating this idea.  An alternative hypothesis                is that diets that promote overeating do so by minimizing the                   osmotic pressure (pressure exerted by dissolved substances) in                  the digestive tract following a meal.  Dr. Ramirez will test                    these explanations in a series of experiments, most of which                    focus on the overeating induced by feeding liquid diets.                                                                                                        The relative palatability of several diets will be compared with                their ability to stimulate food intake.  In another experiment,                 the palatability of liquid and solid diets will be altered by the               addition of palatable and unpalatable flavors.  The ability of                  the flavored diets to alter caloric intake will then be                         determined.                                                                                                                                                     The role of the pressure exerted by dissolved substances in the                 digestive tract will be examined by measuring it in rats that                   have ingested either liquid or solid meals.  This pressure will                 also be manipulated by providing rats with foods that exert                     different osmotic pressures and forcing the animals to drink                    extra water with their meals.  Additional experiments will                      examine the suggestion that young and mature rats respond                       differently to liquid diets.                                                                                                                                    These studies will provide information concerning the basic                     mechanisms controlling food intake and how different foods                      influence these mechanisms.  This in turn may provide practical                 insights into how to modulate domestic-animal growth and human                  appetite.",
