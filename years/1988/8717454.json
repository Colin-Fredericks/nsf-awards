 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is to investigate important environmental                    factors which affect the feeding ecology of two widely studied                  planktivorous fish:  white crappie and bluegill sunfish.  The                   environmental factors to be studied include light intensity,                    turbidity level, abundance of bloom-forming bluegreen algae, and                availability  of various size classes of zooplankton.  Behavioral               factors in the search cycle of these two species will also be                   studied which affect prey choice, feeding efficiency, and                       vigilance for predators, as well as the impact of diel activity                 patterns and satiation on feeding behavior.  The generality of                  saltatory search will be established by observing a schooling                   species of fish (golden shiner) to see where such fish fall on a                gradient of search strategies ranging from ambush to saltatory to               cruise.                                                                              The results of these studies will be incorporated into the                 existing model of planktivorous fish feeding, and the model will                be tested against feeding trials performed in a large outdoor                   arena.  The results of this series of studies will be of                        theoretical interest to those studying the ecology of predation                 as well as of practical interest to those responsible for the                   management of lakes and reservoirs and the production of game                   fish.",
