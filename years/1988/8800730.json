 "awd_abstract_narration": "A systematic survey of DNA variation in the genus Vernonia              (Vernonieae:Asteraceae) will be undertaken using comparative                    restriction site mapping and DNA sequencing in chloroplast DNA.                 Restriction site maps will provide the first direct genetic                     evidence for relationships between New and Old World taxa within                the large tribe Vernonieae, and make it possible to construct a                 genetically based phylogeny.  No such phylogeny current exists.                 Phylogenetic relationships based on cpDNA structure will                        contribute to an understanding of biogeographical relationships                 with Vernonia and the Vernonieae, and would be of value in                      understanding the processes of evolution which have caused the                  Asteraceae to diverge into distinct tribes.  The Asteraceae is                  the largest family of flowering plants with ca. 20,000 species                  worldwide, an understanding of evolutionary processes within this               family has significance to our overall understanding of                         evolutionary processes responsible for past and present floral                  diversity.                                                                              The interactive phase of this project involves a combination            of professional activities as a visiting teacher and researcher                 in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and participation in programs               in Women's Studies and the Women's Center at University of                      Connecticut.  A seminar program jointly sponsored by Ecology and                Evolution and the Women's Center to bring visiting women                        scientists to campus will be used to integrate coursework in                    Molecular Systematics and Women in Science courses.                                     This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1)              to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                  engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF                  and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and                     engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists                and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic                    institutions.  By encouraging the participation of women in                     science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future                     scientific vitality.",
