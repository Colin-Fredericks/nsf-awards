 "awd_abstract_narration": "This model project is designed to increase the                             participation of women and minorities in mathematics careers by                 providing special instructional and outreach activities for                     students in grades six and seven to encourage their enrollment in               high school elective mathematics courses. It is a two-year                      collaborative effort of Louisiana Tech University and Grambling                 State University serving the northern half of the State, and                    Louisiana State University and Dillard University serving the                   south-central metropolitan region. The project identifies women                 and minorities with potential in mathematics, provides enrichment               programs to stimulate their interest in mathematics, and provides               skills and methodology enhancement for middle school mathematics                teachers. The activities in the project include  5-session                      mathematics inservice workshops for skill development of middle                 school teachers based on the concepts and strategies recommended                by the Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics               Report of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. The                  five sessions address topics identified as critical for                         readiness in algebra and geometry and explore the impact of                     mental set (verbal and nonverbal signals that encourage and                     discourage development in math). The sessions are conducted by a                Louisiana NSF Presidential Award winning teacher of high school                 geometry (Mrs. Lynn Stallings-Roberts, 1987). A series of five                  Saturday morning enrichment programs are conducted for students                 identified as having talent in mathematics. The opening session                 is designed for students, their parents, and participating                      teachers in which an overview of activities is presented.                       Succeeding session include telelearning sessions taught by                      award-winning teachers, programs to stimulate interest and                      excitement in mathematics, field trips, individual student                      projects, and a culminating end-of-the-year picnic. A special                   seminar to promote parental support is also held for parents.",
