 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is designed to identify, isolate, and                             characterized genes specifically expressed in floral                            meristems.  The novel tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) \"Thin Cell                    Layer\" (TCL) tissue culture system will be used to produce                      explants containing floral meristems.  TCL explants in floral                   culture conditions produce up to 15 fully differentiated and                    functional flowers according to the following scheme.  Day                      7:active cell division;  Day 13:  organized meristems formed,                   Day 20: differentiated organs visable.  Differential                            screening of a cDNA library made from Day 13 floral TCL                         explants will be used to isolate clones for genes                               transcriptionally expressed at Day 13, but not a Day 7, of                      culture.  Potential meristematic specific genes isolated by                     this approach will be characterized using in situ                               hybridization to identify those expressed in floral                             meristems.  Genes of interest will be subjected to molecular                    and in vitro mutational analysis, facilitated by stable plant                   transformation, to determine the mechanisms of gene                             regulation and function during floral initiation.                                                                                                               This work should greatly improve our understanding of gene                      expression in plant development by providing evidence of the                    factors which control developmentally regulated gene                            expression, and giving insight to the types of genes required                   to change the strategy of plant growth.",
