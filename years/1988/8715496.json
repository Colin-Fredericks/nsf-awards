 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human error is the major cause of structural failure.  Therefore,               modeling and control of errors are an important part of the strategy            to improve the reliability of structures.  The objective of this                study is to develop a practical method to predict the likelihood of             occurrence of human error in structural engineering.  This involves             estimating the sensitivity of the structure to the hazard of gross              errors in design, construction and use.  Human errors are influenced            by a number of conditions which constitute the human, economical,               social and political climate influencing each individual project.               These climatic conditions and their relations to errors constitutes             the data of a knowledge-based expert system (KBES).  A level of risk            is associated with this measure of sensitivity.  Different levels of            risk and structural context call for different strategies for risk              management.  Another objective is to develop a risk management                  procedure in the form of a contingency plan to mitigate the risk                entailed by the gross error sensitivity.  Sensitivity analysis is an            effective tool extended to control some of the predictable errors.              Sensitivity analysis would be extended to include a proper cost-                benefit analysis of allocation options.  The work is based on the               results of a previous study (NSF grant MSM-8304962) and the                     recommendations of NSF Workshop on Modeling Human Errors (June,                 1986).",
