 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this grant is to provide financial support                  for an International Conference on Auroral Physics which will                   take place at St. Johns College in Cambridge, England from July                 11 to 15, 1988.                                                                      Space physics, particularly the subject of solar terrestrial               interaction, has progressed very rapidly since the late 1960's.                 The various spaceborne low altitude particle and field                          measurements over the polar region and the global auroral imaging               capability on several spacecraft have brought auroral physics                   into a new era.  On the other hand, because of the complication                 of each specific instrumentation, and the need for a higher                     level of knowledge in interpreting the observations, many                       scientists doing auroral-related investigations focus on                        relatively narrow topics.                                                            Communication and information interchange have not matched                 the recent rapid progress in both observations and theoretical                  work.  This interchange is particularly difficult in auroral                    physics because activities are spread over many disciplines:                    atomic and molecular physics, geomagnetism, ionospheric physics,                spectroscopy, magnetospheric physics, optics, theoretical plasma                physics, space instrumentation, etc.  There has not been any                    dedicated conference on auroral physics for over ten years, even                though there have been numerous conferences on magnetospheric                   topics which included only certain parts of auroral phenomena.                       The purpose of the international conference is to bring                    scientists who are working and interested in different aspects of               auroral research, and scattered in the various disciplines                      together to review and discuss the state of knowledge of auroral                phenomena.  More importantly, scientists must know others'                      present endeavors.  This meeting will, of course, stimulate                     further collaboration is auroral research across different                      disciplines.  A monograph will be published.  Furthermore, this                 conference will be able to encourage young scientists to                        participate and identify future research in his/her specialized                 discipline as well as an opportunity to broaden into other                      disciplines.",
