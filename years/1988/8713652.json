 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is the structure and dynamics of             the atmosphere in complex terrain, particularly selected valleys in             the Mountain West.  Both new and existing observations will be used             to investigate the heat balance and its relationship to diurnal                 heating, the interaction between the valley atmosphere and other                scales of motion, particularly how the former is related to the                 vertical transfer of heat, moisture and momentum.                                   Professor McKee is well qualified to pursue this research,                  particularly the field measurements.  Also, he has trained excellent            students in the past.                                                               A successful, even empirical, understanding of valley air                   circulation could be crucial to problems in air pollution and other             issues of air quality.                                                              I recommend support as a three year continuing grant at the                 revised budget level.",
