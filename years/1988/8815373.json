 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research on the                                 variability of cosmic radio noise absorption in the                             southern polar region to be carried out by Prof. T.J.                           Rosenberg of the University of Maryland and Prof.                               Alberto J. Foppiano of the University of Concepcion in                          Chile. It appears that recent statistical results on                            the diurnal and seasonable variability absorption by                            the aurora in the southern hemisphere that radiowave                            propagation models need modification. Such models have                          been developed by Prof. Foppiano and this work will be                          directed toward refining and extending these models to                          a wider range of locations and conditions.                                                                                                                      The extensive data base on the radio noise absorption                           in the southern hemisphere compiled by the University                           of Maryland will be used during Prof. Foppiano's visit                          to the U.S. Further collaborative work including                                possibly establishing a joint experimental program at                           U.S. and Chilean Antarctic stations will be explored.                           By providing partial support for the Chilean                                    scientist, this project fulfills the goals of the SDC                           Program.",
