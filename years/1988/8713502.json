 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop a rodenticide                            containing an emetic as the active ingredient.  There is an                     increasing need for such an acute rodenticide in urban                          communities where rats are becoming resistant to warfarin and                                                                                                   other ridenticides of the chronic anticoagulant type.  The                      problem wuth high toxicity rodenticides such as zinc                            phosphide is that there is no safety margin to protect human                    and domestic animals against accidental poisoning.                                                                                                              In this project four plant derived emetic compounds will be                     prepared and incorporated into an acute toxicity rodent bait.                                                                                                   Rats and mice which are unable to vomit will be poisoned                        while cats, dogs and humans will be unaffected.  The emetics                    are: scillirosidin obtained from red squill, scillarenin from                                                                                                   white squill, the digitalis derived from digitoxigenin from                     digitoxin, and wisterine from wisterial vine seeds.                             Preparative, analytical and animal test methods will be                         developed on the emetic aglycones.  The emetic activity will                    be established in pigeons, and later tested with an acute                       rodenticide in a rat bait.  The most likely candidates will                     be field tested.  Success in this project will provide a new                    approach to the growing problem of rat infestation in urban                     communities.",
