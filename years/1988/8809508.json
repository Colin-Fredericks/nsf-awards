 "awd_abstract_narration": "When a disinctively flavored food or drink is followed by                       gastrointestinal distress, similarly flavored edibles are                       subsequently avoided.  This phenomenon is generally known as                    taste-aversion learning.  Taste-aversion learning occurs in a                   variety of species, including humans, nonhuman primates, rodents,               and birds.  Such learning is distinguished by its strength.  For                example, one pairing of a taste with illness is often sufficient                to condition a lasting aversion to the taste, and substantial                   aversions usually can be conditioned when the taste and illness                 are separated by minutes or even hours.                                                                                                                         Dr. Best's experiments investigate how taste-aversion learning is               related to the environmental context in which it occurs.  He has                found, for example, that rats will not drink familiar fluids--                  fluids they would readily consume in other contexts--in an                      environment in which taste-aversion conditioning has occurred.                  This indicates that environments as well as distinctive flavors                 become associated with illness.  In addition, Dr. Best has found                that an environmental context can provide information about where               a distinctive taste should be avoided without the context itself                being associated with illness.  That is, edibles tested in one                  environment correlated with illness but also consumed in another                \"safe\" environment will be avoided only in the \"dangerous\"                      context.  Moreover, in this procedure the only taste avoided in                 the dangerous context is the one paired with illness there.  This               indicates that, depending on the circumstances, environments can                be associated with the aversive consequences of ingestion or                    simply signal the location in which a taste should be avoided.                  The primary focus of Dr. Best's new experiments is to determine                 the factors distinguishing these two phenomena.                                                                                                                 Both of these phenomena, as well as the processes producing them,               have significant implications for human health.  Understanding                  the role of the basic conditioning processes underlying each                    should provide insight into some side effects of chemo- and                     radio-therapy in cancer patients.  Many of these people become                  nauseous from such therapy regimens and subsequently develop                    aversions to the environments in which the treatments took place.               Dr. Best's research can both elucidate the processes underlying                 these environmental aversions and provide alternatives for                      reducing their occurrence.",
