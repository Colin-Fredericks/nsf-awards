 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project are to disperse and stabilize ceramic            powders by way of monolayer adsorption of a polymer for improved                properties and reduction of processing cost.  After the                         stabilization, the particles are bonded by crosslinkings of the                 adsorbed polymer for forming.  Amorphous silica and alumina will be             used and dispersed in a nonaqueous solvent and will be stabilized by            adsorbed polymers.                                                              Candidate polymers will have anchor groups for stronger adsorption              and will have crosslinkable groups for setting of the powder after              being dispersed and stabilized.  The dispersion stability will be               determined by measuring sedimentation volume, viscosity, turbidity,             etc. Dispersion stability is one of the most important parameters in            ceramic powder processing because it is directly related to the                 mechanical properties of the ceramic part.  Binding of the ceramic              powders will be carried out by adding a few weight percent of                   catalyst to the powder/polymer mix or by thermally inducing inter-              particulate bonding via crosslinking of the adsorbed polymers.  The             green bodies formed from the process will be characterized in terms             of density, flexibility, microstructure, homogeneity, etc.                      The novelty of this research is the use of much smaller amounts of              organic additives and increased solid loading in ceramic forming                processes.  This would result in increased homogeneity, better                  control over the flexibility of ceramic tapes, lower                            shrinkage, and shorter binder burn-out time which would lead to                 the reduction of processing cost.",
