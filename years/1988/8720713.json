 "awd_abstract_narration": "A detailed sedimentological study of the Miocene Siwalik deposits               of the Potwar Plateau in northern Pakistan is proposed.                         Temporally and spatially varying fluvial paleoenvironments will be              reconstructed in terms of paleochannel and floodplain geometry and              hydraulics, chemistry of lacustrine waters, nature of paleosols,                distribution of animal and plant activity, river diversions, and                deposition rates.  Changes in these characters will be related to               local, regional and/or global controls including climate,                       tectonism, and sediment supply.  It will then be possible to                    understand an important period of evolution of land organisms in                relation to changes in the physical and chemical environment over               a period between 14 and 7 my B.P.  The Siwalik deposits offer an                unparalleled opportunity to realise these objectives because of:                1) excellent 3-D exposures of 3000 m + of strata; 2) previous                   studies of lithostratigraphy, vertebrate paleontology, and                      paleomagnetic age-dating; 3) independent constraints on climatic                change and tectonic activity using geologic data now available for              areas outside the depositional basin.  Understanding of the                     evolution of fluival deposits (including the fossils they contain)              in response to tectonism and climate has implications for rocks of              all ages worldwide.  Such knowledge has economic implications                   because fluival deposits are commonly reservoirs for water, oil,                and gas, also are sources of coal, gold, uranium, and building                  materials.",
