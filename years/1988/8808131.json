 "awd_abstract_narration": "When loose sands saturated with water are subjected to the cyclic               loads resulting from severe earthquake shaking, excess pore water               pressures are generated if the water cannot easily drain away                   (undrained behavior).  This excess pore pressure reduces the soil               strength, and if sufficient pressure is generated, will lead to a               failure of the soil referred to as liquefaction.                                                                                                                Current methods for predicting the generation of pore water                     pressure during cyclic loading often overpredict the pressures                  generated, that is, they result in conservative predictions.  This              research project is investigating the accuracy of soil models                   currently used for the prediction of earthquake-generated pore water            pressures, with special attention being given to the effect of the              dissipation of this pressure during and after the earthquake.  The              predictions are being compared with laboratory test data as well as             data obtained from field tests using an instrumented site at Owi                Island, Tokyo Bay, Japan.  This data includes ground motion time                histories as well as dynamic pore water pressure measurements at                two depths in the loose sandy subsoils.",
