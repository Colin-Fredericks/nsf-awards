 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for nine U.S. scientists to                 participate in a seminar on geophysical fluid dynamics at                       Interlaken, Switzerland in September, 1988.  Four Swiss researchers             and other scientists from Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom and            Canada are also expected to attend.  Dr. Susan J. Friedlander,                  University  of Illinois, Chicago, and Dr. Kolumban Hutter, Swiss                Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, are organizing the seminar.                                                                                            The purpose of the seminar is to bring together a group of                      scientists from several disciplines to exchange their research                  findings and ideas about internal waves in geophysical contexts.                The participants include applied mathematicians, geophysicists,                 meteorologists, limnologists, oceanographers, and others.  The                  unifying theme of the conference is the study of wave motion in                 rotating, stratified fluids.  Such fluids possess a variety of wave             motions that are significant to a large number of phenomena in                  lakes, oceans, the atmosphere and the earth's core.  The seminar                will cover four broad topics:  (1) Effects of boundaries on internal            waves, (2) Planetary waves on the beta-plane and in spherical                   shells, (3) Nonlinear internal waves, particularly solitary waves,              and (4) Magnetohydrodynamic waves in rotating fluids.  These topics             have applications in understanding lake and ocean waves in various              topographical conditions, atmospheric and planetary waves, earth                core waves, interactions of different waves, and certain geophysical            and astrophysical phenomena.  The conference format will be several             presentations of invited lectures followed by discussions each day.             The proceedings of the conference will be published in a special                issue of Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics with the                  seminar organizers as guest editors.",
