 "awd_abstract_narration": "Planning for hazardous spill prevention and response rarely                     considers earthquakes.  Similarly, with the exception of nuclear                power plants and natural gas lines, earthquake planning has                     only recently begun to include hazardous materials as part of                   emergency planning efforts.  Yet, emergency response experts                    acknowledge that toxic material releases may be a major                         concern in moderate-to-large earthquakes affecting                              industrialized and metropolitan areas.                                                                                                                          This project will analyze alternative strategies for reducing the               number and severity of hazardous material incidents during                      earthquakes.  The following are some of the research questions                  that will be addressed:  (1) What specific measures or                          strategies are users of extremely hazardous materials, or large                 amounts of hazardous materials, currently using to minimize                     potential problems in the United States and other industrialized                countries?  (2) How can strategies developed to mitigate more                   common hazardous materials incidents or earthquake hazards be                   modified to deal with this combined hazard?  (3) Which of                       these strategies have been subjected to laboratory testing                      and/or been tested by being subjected to an actual earthquake?                                                                                                  An interdisciplinary team will be used to integrate state-of-                   the-art expertise in hazardous materials management,                            earthquake preparedness, and engineering design.  The team                      expertise will be augmented by that of a technical review                       committee.  Past earthquake experiences and research efforts                    will be considered.  Literature review will be augmented with                   interviews of selected company officials and local government                   staff.  A range of mitigation strategies will be examined,                      including risk assessment, site analysis, structural design,                    nonstructural safety measures and education.",
