 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will allow collaborative studies between Dr. Philip S.               Ward of the University of California, Davis and Dr. Robert W. Taylor            of the Australian National Insect Collection, Canberra, Australia on            the systematic relationships of Indo-Australian ants.  The principle            objectives of the research are (1) to clarify  the species-level                systematics of several important groups of Indo-Australian ants, (2)            to gather data which will facilitate the analysis of phylogenetic               relationships among these ants, and (3) to utilize information on               ant phylogeny and distribution to test biogeographic hypotheses                 about the Australian continent.  Field collections will be made in              Australia and Melanesia.  Specimens will be analyzed using a                    combination of conventional morphological examination, morphometric             analysis, and scanning electron microscope studies of                           microsculpture.  Taxonomic assessments will be aided by a taxonomic             database management system and computer-assisted programs for                   phylogenetic inference.                                                                                                                                         Results from this research will provide much-needed taxonomic                   revisions of several ant groups and will yield insight into the                 history of the Australian biota.  Dr. Ward has broad knowledge of               the ant groups to be studied as well as a background in current                 biochemical and analytical procedures.  Dr. Taylor has more than 20             years of experience on the Australian ant fauna in general, as well             as access to important collections and computer programs and                    equipment necessary for analytical evaluation and processing.",
