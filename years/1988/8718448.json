 "awd_abstract_narration": "A comparison of the roles of intra and intersexual selection            in the evolution of sex-limited mimicry in two swallowtail                      butterflies.                                                                            Both black and tiger swallowtails (Papilio polyxenes and P.             glaucus) exhibit mimicry of the distasteful pipevine swallowtail                (Battus philenor) that is limited to females.  Selection against                novel mimetic coloration in males results either from mating                    preferences for typical males by females or the reduced success                 of novel males in direct competition with typical males.  Using a               series of parallel experiments, the investigators will compare                  the impact of female intersexual selection with that of male                    intrasexual selection on the maintenance of the ancestral color                 in males.  The profound differences in the mating systems of                    these related butterflies will aid in distinguishing between the                alternatives.  Intrasexual selection may be very important in the               black swallowtail, where males are aggregated and aggressively                  territorial, but is unlikely to be important in the tiger                       swallowtail, where males are dispersed and patrol widely for                    females.  The influence of coloration will be evaluated by                      altering the appearance of males to resemble females, then                      comparing their success in courtship, copulation, territorial                   defense and mate location with unaltered males.  Observed effects               will be attributable to either inter- or intrasexual selection.                         The results of this research will improve our understanding             of the evolution of mimicry and protective coloration.  It will                 provide the first experimental test of the alternative sexual                   selection hypotheses and estimate the relative importance of                    each.  From the applied viewpoint, the research will indicate the               potential to control or alter mating success in visually oriented               insect pest species.  In addition, knowing the mechanisms of                    reproductive isolation will aid us in understanding gene flow in                these species.  This could be important in predicting the                       movement of resistance genes to natural plant toxins or                         pesticides in natural or pest populations.",
