 "awd_abstract_narration": "The grant provides for the laboratory analysis of                          airborne fine particles collected in different regions of the                   world at locations representative of characteristic                             vegetational communities.  Complementing earlier work by the                    same investigator in which hydrocarbon types were the prime                     object of the laboratory analyses, the current project will                     emphasize the analysis of the oxygen-bearing species in the                     same samples stored up to ten years following earlier field-                    sampling operations.  An important element of the research                      is the identification of \"chemical signatures\" in terms of the                  composition of plant waxes naturally released from the                          vegetation of plant communities characterizing areas of                         regional extent around the world.  Some samples are included                    to represent both anthropogenic and natural combustion sources.                      The research will further define the organic chemistry of                  airborne particulate matter in the troposphere, and it will                     provide data on the chemistry of particulates from known                        regional origins for use in tracing atmospheric transport                       pathways.",
