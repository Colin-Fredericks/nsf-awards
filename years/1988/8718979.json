 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research on chemical and mantle                 xenoliths from Northeast China, and provides an important                       opportunity for US scientists to study and sample young volcanic                rocks from an area which has had only limited opportunities for                 collaborative research.  The US principal investigator, Douglas                 Macdougall, of Scripps Institue of Oceanography, will work with                 scientists at the Chinese Academy of Science's Institute of                     Geochemistry in Guiyang, to characterize and understand the                     evolution of selected areas of the Chinese lithosphere.  Samples                will be collected in China, and analyzed primarily in the US, with              joint participation by US and Chinese scientists in both phases of              the projects.                                                                                                                                                   This research is expected to contribute both to understanding of the            chemical composition of the earth's upper mantle and to the further             development of cooperative relationships among US and Chinese                   scientists.",
