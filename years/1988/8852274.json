 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes an economics computer laboratory. The             laboratory enables the department to incorporate the computer into its          undergraduate curriculum and thus enhances the ability of the students          to conceptualize the essence of economic and empirical techniques.  The         award provides adequate capacity to absorb large classes such as                introductory statistics, takes advantage of recent developments in              object oriented languages, relational data bases, and integrated                applications, as well as user friendly environments developments that           will help the student conceptualize the substance of the course                 material.  Thirty one MacIntosh II's along with related peripheral              equipment and software are provided.  All students in the introductory          statistics class can now take a computer laboratory course in                   statistics.  In addition, by taking advantage of recent software                developments, the computer laboratory is used as a tool to enhance              students' understanding of important economic and, especially,                  empirical concepts.                                                                                                                                                  The award will be matched by an equal amount from the grantee.",
