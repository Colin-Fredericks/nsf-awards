 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the doctoral dissertation research of Ms.                   Diana Barkan.  Her dissertation topic is: \"The History of Low                   Temperature Studies as Related to Early Quantum Theory.\"                                                                                                        Ms. Barkan's project is an historical investigation into the                    development of experimental physics and physical chemistry in the               early decades of the 20th century.  She will focus on low                       temperature studies, particularly those in Berlin and Leiden.                   During the years 1910-1912, W. Nernst, one of the most prominent                of German scientists of the period, promoted the study of                       specific heats because of their importance for quantum theory.                  He created a powerful interdisciplinary school with practitioners               from various subdisciplines of physics and chemistry in order to                carry out his research projects.  Ms Barkan will compare Nerst's                approach with that of another team headed by H. Kammerlingh Onnes               in Leiden.  Nerst's and Onnes' research showed that low                         temperature studies were a critical experimental testing ground                 for the quantum hypothesis and their results provided significant               feedback for the development of quantum theory.                                                                                                                 This research examines a too-little investigated area in the                    history of modern science.  We know too little about the history                of physical chemistry in general and of the specific role of                    experimentation in physics and physical chemistry in the                        development of quantum theory.  This project promises to open up                new, important areas for history and philosophy of science.",
