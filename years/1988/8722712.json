 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long range scientific goals of this research are to increase                understanding of the correlation of molecular structure with                    physical properties of ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) phases,               and to test strategies for design of new materials.  The                        practical goal is the invention of new FLC materials with                       properties suited for incorporation into commercial FLC shutters                and large-area matrix displays.                                                                                                                                 Ferroelectric (chiral) smectic C liquid crystals have been shown                to exhibit high speed, multistate electro-optic and display                     device applications, particularly when incorporated into the                    surface stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystal (SSFLC) light                   valve.  The best materials for use in such devices would have a                 high ferroelectric polarization and low orientational viscosity,                affording a fast electro-optic response time, broad temperature                 range, and excellent chemical stability.  No materials currently                available, however, possess the required speed, temperature range               and stability to allow fabrication of large area multiplexed                    arrays operating at video rates with gray scale.                                                                                                                The proposal outlines a plan of work directed toward the                        preparation of new materials satisfying this need.  The new                     materials will be both pure FLC components designed for high                    polarization, low viscosity, and chemical stability, and also                   mixtures of materials containing the new components with broad                  temperature ranges and fast electro-optic response times.//",
