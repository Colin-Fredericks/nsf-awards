 "awd_abstract_narration": "The organization of an animal society may be influenced by its                  genetic structure.  Dr. Page will test this principle of social                 behavior with social insects, which live in some of the most                    complex colonies on earth.  He will determine whether or not                    genetic composition of a colony of honey bees influences one of                 the most prominent traits of insect social organization, the                    division of labor among workers.                                                                                                                                The honey bee is an ideal species for studying the genetic basis                of colony organization because it exhibits an elaborate division                of labor, and because its colonies are genetically diverse, due                 to the polygamous mating behavior of queens.  Methods of                        culturing and experimental manipulation are uniquely available                  for honey bees, allowing especially thorough study of behavioral                genetics.  Dr. Page's research is designed to determine whether                 or not differences in division of labor among worker honey bees                 have a genetic basis, and, if so, to delineate the relative                     importance of both genetic and environmental influences on worker               behavior.  Two genetic techniques will be applied to the study of               division of labor for the first time.  First, the effect of                     intracolonial genetic variation on the division of labor will be                examined in colonies of bees bearing biochemical genetic markers.               Second, a program of artificial selection will be conducted to                  produce lines of bees that differ in the tendency to specialize                 on one task; these lines will be used as probes to study the                    interactions between genetic and environmental determinants of                  task performance.                                                                                                                                               The principal significance of this research is that it may chart                a new direction for the study of the insect societies, because it               has long been thought that differences in worker behavior are                   determined by the environment.  This study also provides an                     excellent opportunity to analyze the genetic and environmental                  determinants of behavior in an animal displaying a rich                         behavioral repertoire, because it will be possible to exert                     unusually precise control over both genetic and environmental                   conditions.",
