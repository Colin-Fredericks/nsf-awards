 "awd_abstract_narration": "The technology-based \"Self Help Elementary Level Science\" (SHELLS)              package is a three-year project to help teachers and administrators             integrate science into their elementary programs.                                                                                                               Twelve major obstacles to doing science in the elementary school have           been identified and strategies have been designed for dealing with them         through video and audio tapes and print materials.  One set of video and        audio tapes will show what to do to minimize or reduce the obstacles.           Another set will teach basic physical science concepts.  A third set            will be explicitly helpful to administrators.  In addition, experienced         elementary teachers will model how to put them into practice with               research based teaching examples.                                                                                                                               Thirteen video and six audio tapes with print materials will be                 developed.  The intent is to provide administrators and teachers with           instructional tapes to be used as a stand alone inservice program by            individual teachers and principals or as a supplement to inservice and          preservice activities conducted by trained leaders.                                                                                                             Video production laboratories in the Colleges of Engineering, Medicine          and Education at the University of Florida and at the Association for           Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD) in Virginia will                  collaborate in the making of the tapes with scientists, supervisors,            administrators and teachers from twelve institutions and districts.                                                                                             Dissemination plans for SHELLS recognize the value of working with              professional organizations that have good access to administrators and          elementary teachers.  The Association for Supervision and Curriculum            Development which has extensive experience in video education,                  publications and institutes for administrators and teachers will be the         publisher of the SHELLS project and will take major responsibility for          dissemination.  The National Science Teachers Association will                  collaborate in dissemination as will the National Association of                Elementary School Principals.                                                                                                                                   Dr. Mary Budd Rowe, principal investigator, is well recognized for her          research in elementary science education.  Dr. Rowe's background and            experience more than qualify her to conduct the project.                                                                                                        This project addresses the goals of the Instructional Materials Program,        particularly the application of an alternative method of delivering             instruction.                                                                                                                                                    An award is recommended to Florida State University, Gainesville for the        Self Help Elementary Level Science program.",
