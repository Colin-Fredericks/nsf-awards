 "awd_abstract_narration": "The description and analysis of relationships among individuals,                organizations and other social actors is a central sociological issue.          Network analysis permits the documentation and study of transactions            which take place among social systems as well as among individuals.                                                                                             The proposed research examines a number of network exchange theories,           and will use computer simulations to compare, test, extend, and                 integrate alternative theories of linkages within networks.  The goal           is to understand how information and resources are exchanged in a               variety of settings, such as social groups or large organizations.                                                                                              Network exchange theorizing has, on the one hand, shown signs of having         great potential explanatory power in a wide range of real life                  contexts.  On the other hand, theories are spawned in near complete             isolation.  The work of testing alternative paradigms remains to be             done.  This study, therefore, can offer insights that will be                   invaluable to the further development of network exchange simulations           and research.",
