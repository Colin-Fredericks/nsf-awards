It will be                               hosted by the Brazilian counterparts Woodruff W.                                Benson and Thomas M. Lewinsohn of the Universidade                              Estadual de Campinas. The speakers represent the top                            people working in plant-herbivore interactions                                  although not all in tropical systems, a plus in                                 bringing knowledge from other areas to application to                           the tropical system.                                                                                                                                            The meeting is on an excellent topic for Brazil and                             will improve communications between the U.S. and                                Brazil. Campinas is the best university to host such a                          meeting. With international concern for the loss of                             tropical ecosystems, this meeting represents an ideal                           opportunity for cross-fertilization between those in a                          country containing some of the largest such ecosystems                          and those scientists who have been thinking about such                          systems conceptually. There is an urgent need to                                improve communications between U.S. and Brazilian                               scientists. Support is recommended particularly for                             promoting information exchange and future U.S./Brazil                           collaboration.",
