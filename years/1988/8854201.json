 "awd_abstract_narration": "Portable equipment and other relatively inexpensive devices can be used         to stimulate student interest in astronomy provided that the instructor         has the appropriate background.  This workshop is particularly for              faculty who teach introductory astronomy courses but who have had               limited professional training in the field.  These instructors, at both         2- and 4- year colleges will participate in a two-week workshop                 involving various activities that illustrate the methods of astronomy           and that will enhance undergraduate teaching programs.                                                                                                          Through the Center for Science and Mathematics Teaching, new                    technologies will be introduced, while in other daily sessions                  participants will be actively involved in the type of exercises they            might use with their students.  Two field trips are planned: to                 introduce participants to certain aspects of radio astronomy; and, at           night, as a follow-up to a session on astrophotography.  In four                evenings scientists at Tufts will discuss their current research in             relevant fields.                                                                                                                                                In addition to the NSF funds, participants will contribute about 10% in         travel expenses toward the cost of operation of the project.",
