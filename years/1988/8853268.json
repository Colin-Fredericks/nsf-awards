 "awd_abstract_narration": "With help from the instruments obtained through this project, the          Biology and Psychology Departments are increasing their                         interdisciplinary approach to neurobiological studies.  The two                 departments already share labs and animal room facilities and cross-            fertilize one another's laboratory exercises in Physiological                   Psychology and Histology.  In the latter case, lesioned rat brains are          microscopically examined in the Histology lab.  The present project is          fostering the further development of this type of cooperation.                                                                                                       With a new Biology faculty member who is acquainted with                   fluorescent microscopy, studies of brain neurotransmitters are being            incorporated into several course.  With new computer-interfaced                 instrumentation, the Psychology Department is able to improve                   undergraduates' laboratory work in electrophysiology.  Through the              sharing of this equipment, techniques perfected in the Psychology               Department have become available to students in Physiology courses.             Additional instruments enable the Psychology Department to include in           its laboratory program some EEG and biofeedback studies, while enabling         the Biology Department to update the performance level and reliability          of its physiological monitoring equipment.  The requested equipment             also enhances undergraduate research projects already boosted by a              highly effective DANA Foundation program which financially supports             undergraduates doing summer research.                                                                                                                                The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
