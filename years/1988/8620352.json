 "awd_abstract_narration": "Behavioral ecology, like other rapidly growing disciplines, has                 developed a body of theory that is only now being tested                        experimentally.  Dr. Alcock's research, although focused on one                 group of insects, has broader relevance to the question of how                  habitat and female behavior interact and how they in turn                       influence male behavior.                                                                                                                                        This project employs an experimental approach to an analysis of                 proximate cues and ultimate function in a resource-defense mating               system.  There have been few experimental studies of the relation               between resource control and reproductive success in any animal                 that engages in resource-defense polygyny.  By studying a species               of dragonfly, Paltothemis lineatipes, Dr. Alcock will determine                 what cues males and females use to make decisions about which                   areas to defend and which areas to use as egg-laying sites,                     respectively.  Then Dr. Alcock will examine the effects of                      variation in the quantity of resources within territories on the                attractiveness of different sites to egg-laying females and                     territorial males.  The results from experiments using resource-                poor and resource-rich locations will be used as a foundation for               a study of a population of marked males to determine if                         individuals distribute themselves in ways that reduce the                       variation in daily or lifetime reproductive success.                                                                                                            The results of Dr. Alcock's research project will stand as a test               of the generality of findings on resource manipulation in a                     damselfly species with a similar resource-defense mating system.                The project also directly examines the fundamental prediction of                modern models of the evolution of mating systems, namely that the               distribution of resources will determine patterns of female                     availability and thereby drive the evolution of male competitive                tactics.",
