 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adaptive control theory lacks a conceptual framework which is                   sufficiently simple to help qualified nonspecialists to understand the          current theory without making an inordinately large time investment             and which might also serve as the basis for further development.  PI            proposes to continue his recently initiated research program aimed at           constructing such a framework.                                                                                                                                  Existing adaptive algorithms of 'practical' structure for which                 'global' stability can be proved without requiring sufficient                   excitation are only applicable to process models satisfying                     assumptions which recent results suggest are unnecessarily                      restrictive.  The reason for this seems to be related to the reliance           of these algorithms on an augmented error for parameter tuning.  He             proposes to develop algorithms which can adaptively stabilize                   processes under assumptions weaker than those presently required.  His          approach will be to use indirect control concepts, since error                  augmentation is not needed using this approach.  He will use computer           simulation experiments to rule out unacceptable algorithms and to               guide him in the development of acceptable ones.",
