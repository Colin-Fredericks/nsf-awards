 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will utilize a two stage plant tissue culture system to              study the effect of various environmental factors on the control of             secondary metabolite production.  The model system chosen for this              purpose is the production of rosmarinic acid (an antiedema drug) by             species of Coleus blumei and/or Salvia officinalis. The environmental           factors to be investigated include dissolved oxygen/carbondioxide,              shear, and mass transfer.  These latter two factors involve the                 effects of agitation and cell aggregation on secondary metabolite               production.                                                                                                                                                     The importance of this study is two-fold.  First, not only will it be           useful to the engineer in obtaining scale-up data for plant                     suspension cell systems to have a simple model system with which to             work, but also the plant physiologist and geneticist prefer plant               suspension cultures rather than field crops in which to carry out               their experiments.  Secondly, experience in working with and scaling            up plant cell systems for the production of important chemicals and             drugs will become necessary as population growth and its associated             housing needs encroaches on land use for agriculture production.                Plant cell growth in bioreactors, which can expand in a third                   dimension compared with only two dimensions for field crops, offers an          alternative means of production, particularly of valuable drugs.",
