These compounds are of                         interest because  they are expected to have unusual                             conductivity and electronic and ferromagnetic properties. Some                  of the compounds to be synthesized will contain cavities                        designed to bind selectively such small molecules as carbon                     dioxide, carbon disulfide or oxygen.                                                                                                                            The molecules to be studied will include linear and macrocyclic                 azanes of P, As, and Al based on designed 1,4-functional units                  which will be synthesized stereoselectively and with specific                   coordinating properties. Multiple donor site cavity-containing                  (cavitand) cyclophosphazanes, uniquely capable of stabilizing                   lambda4-E-lambda4 and lambda5-E-Lambda5 P-E-P bridge bonds                      (where E is a main-group atom), as well as fractional P..P                      bonds, will be examined. Using the trimethylsilylphosphine                      synthon and opposed-polarity functionality based reactions, new                 group IV element (E=Si, Ge) cyclodienephosphines,                               phosphabenzenes, and Group IV element cage molecules will be                    synthesized. These will provide frameworks in which to study pi                 electron delocalization in 1,4-E,P-heteroatom rings,                            intramolecular transannular E-P interaction in cages, and cage                  encapsulation and/or coordination of atoms or small molecules.",
