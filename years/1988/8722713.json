 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Jorgensen is developing a general method for producing hybrid               seed which removes the primary barrier to the use of nuclear male               sterile genes. These genes give rise to male sterility only when                the plant is homozygous for the recessive male sterility alleles.               As a result, male sterile plants must be propagated by                          backcrossing to male fertiles, yielding a mixed population of                   fertiles and steriles.  Thus, pure stands of male sterile plants                cannot be obtained without precise and expensive procedures for                 sorting out the male fertile segregants. Dr. Jorgensen's                        solution to this problem is to create linkage between a male                    sterile gene and a marker gene by introducing the marker gene to                plant chromosomes by genetic transformation.  From among many                   plants independently transformed with a suitable marker gene, he                will select (by test-crossing) a linkage sufficient for hybrid                  seed production.  The most suitable marker is seed color, because               colored seed can be sorted electronically before planting.  To                  this end, he is engineering a bacterial gene that determines                    indigo synthesis so that it can be expressed in plant cells.                    The method offers clear advantages over currently available                     technologies, whose limitations result in high costs and/or low                 purity of hybrid seed in many crop plants.                                      %%%                                                                             The use of hybrid plants is well known as a means to enhance                    plant productivity and value.  This value results not only from                 the increased vigor and yield of hybrids, but also from  their                  improved uniformity and quality.  Because most important crop                   plants display substantial heterotic vigor, hybrid seed is widely               perceived to be a valuable commodity. This project is designed to               allow these hybrids to be sorted out as seeds in an economically                feasible way.  The aim is to introduce, via genetic engineering,                a set of genes that produce a colored compound in male sterile                  plants.  The use of male sterile plants is important in producing               hybrid plants because they cannot self pollinate.",
