 "awd_abstract_narration": "Commercial harvest of yellow perch in the Great Lakes region            can not meet market demand.  Additional controls being placed on                commercial harvest, while consumer demand and high perch prices                 have generated renewed interest in perch aquaculture.  Attempts                 to establish commercial perch culture have faced three major                    constraints:  1) seasonal supply for fingerlings, 2) feeding fry                practical feeds, and 3) providing optimum growth conditions.                    Stunted 3-5 inch perch could be harvested from wild populations                 or raised in farm ponds to provide a year-round source of larger                fish for intensive culture using waste heat.  Stunted perch are                 not acceptable to most anglers and have no comercial value.                             Various harvesting, holding and transportation methods and              prophylactic treatments will be tested to minimize stress and                   disease.  Perch will be fed practical feeds immediately or will                 be converted from live feeds (minnows) to practical feeds over a                10-14 day period.  Fish converted to practical feeds will be fed                commercially available fish feeds to determine growth rates at                  20oC.  Comparisons between stunted and non-stunted perch will be                used to determine if stunted perch exhibit growth compensation                  and if the added growth (weight gain) is fat or protein (muscle).               Results from phase I research could provide solutions to the                    major constraints to commercial perch aquaculture.",
