 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants in both natural and agricultural ecosystems are                  subject to attack by disease-causing microorganisms.  Recent                    studies of plants in natural ecosystems have revealed that plants               possess a range of different mechanisms of disease resistance                   toward pathogens.  However, the effectiveness of resistance often               varies considerably:  some plants exhibit strong resistance,                    while others are highly susceptible to disease.  The proposed                   research seeks to understand why plants in natural communities                  have not always been successful in evolving mechanisms to prevent               pathogen attack:  what types of constraints have been most                      important in preventing the development of effective disease                    resistance?  The project will focus on disease resistance in one                plant species, the native legume Amphicarpaea bracteata.                                The intensive study of non-cultivated plants and their                  pathogens provides the opportunity to develop general insights                  about principles of plant adaptation to pathogen attack, in                     particular, the physiological and genetic factors that limit the                evolution of disease resistance.  Studies of disease problems                   faced by plants in natural ecosystems may thus be useful also in                designing more effective strategies of disease control in                       agriculture.",
