 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support an experimental investigation of                   transient and localized perturbations of the lower ionosphere                   that occur in association with atmospheric lightning discharges                 and with natural wave bursts that originate in the magnetosphere.               Recent experimental evidence has demonstrated the importance of                 the lower ionosphere and the middle atmosphere in the coupling                  between parts of the atmosphere-ionosphere-magnetosphere system.                Lightning-induced effects occurring in the troposphere are                      coupled to the ionosphere through the mesosphere, creating                      impulsive ionospheric electric fields, altering ionospheric                     electron density and conductivity, and launching electromagnetic                whistler waves.  Energetic radiation belt particles precipitated                as a result of magnetospheric interactions whistler waves and                   with burst of VLF emissions are deposited into the lower                        ionosphere and the mesosphere, causing secondary ionization, x-                 rays, light emissions, and heating.  The aim of this grant is to                gain better understanding of the processed of downward and upward               coupling in the magnetosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere-troposphere                 system and of the effects of these processes on the dynamics of                 the earth's radiation belts.                                                         The transient perturbation events are remotely sensed by                   means of high resolution measurements of the amplitude and phase                of subionospheric VLF/LF radio signals, which are sensitive to                  perturbations of electron density at mesospheric and D-region                   altitudes.  Simultaneous observations at selected locations in                  the United States and Canada will be used to investigate:  (i)                  the geographic distribution and geomagnetic conjugate                           relationships of event occurrence and characteristics, (ii)  the                association of VLF signal perturbation events with lightning                    discharges, (iii) spatial structure of perturbed ionospheric                    region(s) associated with individual lightning flashes as well                  as with active thunderstorm centers, and (iv) the role of                       atmospheric discharges in the dynamics of the radiation belts.",
