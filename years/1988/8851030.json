 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Saturday Academy, an adjunct of the Oregon Graduate Center which            offers extra-school courses for motivated pre-college science students,         will join with the Business/Education Compact of Washington County (WA)         in three programs.                                                                                                                                              (1) Community-based science and technology teacher enhancement programs.        As with previously successful student courses, they will be taught by a         variety of professionals at sites throughout the area, ranging from             industries to academic institutions.  Classes will be informal,                 participative, stress currently important areas of science and                  technology, and provide material for teachers to incorporate into their         own teaching.                                                                                                                                                   (2) An invention-oriented creativity and design competition for middle          school students.  Teachers will be trained in techniques of encouraging         creativity through the process of invention.  Businesses will be                recruited to sponsor the event and provide technical personnel to work          with students in developing inventions.  The inventions will be                 displayed and judged at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry.                                                                                              (3) Computer networking to link science teachers in other parts of the          state to the Saturday Academy and to each other.  This will be initiated        at four existing satellites of the Academy using existing computer              facilities to define how such networking can best be utilized and               provide a model for future expansion.                                                                                                                           Cost sharing by the partners will total 108% of the NSF funding.",
