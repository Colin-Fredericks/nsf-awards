 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Craig's research in this program has been concerned                 with the colatile and isotopic chemistry of hydrothermal vents                  along the Mid-ocean Ridge spreading centers, the fluxes of                      these fluids into the deepsea, and the study of the deep                        circulation by use of these tracers (3He) combines with natural                 radioactive isotopes.  During the past two years he has                         extended the known occurrences of hydrothermal vents to the                     Back-arc basins of the SW Pacific (Lau, North Fiji, and Manus                   Basins), to the western Pacific in the Mariana Trough, and to                   volcanic hotspots such as Loiji Seamount on the Hawaiian                        hotspot, and East Pacific Rise vents at the Pascua hotspot on                   the Eastern microplate.  This year in two ALVIN diving programs                 he has sampled 30'C vents in Loihi caldera, and 285'C vents                     (\"clear smokers\") in two major hydrothermal areas we discovered                 in the Mariana Trough.  Before the end of 1987 he will run an                   expedition transect across the two Pacific zonal helium jets in                 the North and South Pacific, to begin the detailed mapping of                   these major features of the deep Pacific circulation, New                       results reported here include details of the 3He, CH4, and Mn                   relationships in MOR, Hotspot, and Back-arc vents, radiocarbon                  and stable carbon isotopes in vent fluids, 39Ar and N and O                     isotopes in N2O, etc.  A detailed 77-page Data Report on the SW                 Pacific Basin studies (Papatua Expedition) has been issued.                                                                                                             No new expedition work is planned after 1987, for the next              two years.  Rather, he intends to complete all the analytical                   work on the expedition samples and ALVIN programs of 1986-87,                   and to concentrate on onterpretation and synthesis of the MOR,                  hotspot, Back-arc, and deep-ocean isotopic and chemical                         studies.",
