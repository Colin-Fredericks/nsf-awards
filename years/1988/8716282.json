 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of U.S. scientists in a               seminar on the \"Generation and Application of Hot Dense Laser                   Plasma,\" organised jointly by Professor George Miley of the                     University of Illinois and Professor Sadao Nakai of Osaka                       University, Japan.  United States and Japanese participants will                meet in Honolulu, Hawaii during May 1988.  The seminar will focus               on recent research developments in laser-produced plasmas.  Topics              for discussion will include:  laser-plasma interactions; energy                 transport and radiation-atomic processes in laser produced plasmas;             high brightness x-ray sources; and various technical applications               of laser produced plasmas such as inertial confinement fusion and               particle acceleration.                                                                                                                                          The unique high-temperature, high density plasmas which are                     produced using powerful lasers represent a new regime of matter                 that is receiving intense research in both the U.S. and Japan.                  This seminar will be the fourth in a series that have been held on              this general topic under the U.S.-Japan Cooperative Science                     Program, beginning in 1972.  The 1988 seminar agenda emphasizes the             potential new applications of laser plasmas in industrial                       processing.  The seminar will provide a valuable forum for                      assessing the state-of-the-art in the field, for immersing                      relatively new investigators, and for charting directions for                   future collaborative research.",
