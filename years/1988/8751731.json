 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goals of the project are to provide inservice                          opportunities to thirty high school mathematics teachers in                     the Pacific Northwest who have taught or will be teaching                       calculus in either a standard twelve grade course or an                         Advanced Placement course. The vehicle for the inservice                        experiences is a collection of \"mathematical jewels\" dealing                    with captivating approaches to calculus concepts that differ                    from those in ordinary textbooks. The jewels are to be                          collected in a Handbook of Conceptual Aides for Learning the                    Calculus. It should be emphasized that the approach taken in                    the Handbook is to offer enriching activities the teachers                      can use to provide motivation to their students so as to                        avoid a traditional way of teaching calculus which often                        \"...is commonly reduced to a technical journey through a                        textbook, lacking that extra insight, example, illustration                     or application which brings the subject alive...\"\u0131Page 10, of                   the proposal narrative.! The schedule calls for development                     of the teacher handbook during the summer 1988 to be written                    primarily by the project staff and based upon previous work                     with teachers. In August, 1988 there is scheduled a                             conference for five teachers and the two principal                              investigators. The teachers have already been selected and                      will be instrumental in the field test efforts of the                           project. During October 1988 the staff and field test                           teachers will, at the Northwest Mathematics Conference,                         present ideas from the project work up to that point and                        recruit participants for the summer conference. During the                      following winter term the staff will visit the schools of the                   five pilot teachers and work extensively with students at                       that time. Later that Spring there will be a two day                            conference of the pilot teachers and the principal                              investigators to develop a detailed outline of the materials                    to be revised. During the following Summer, 1989, there will                    be an intensive conference for 25 participants in addition to                   the pilot teachers. The goal is to provide the teachers with                    a deeper understanding of the calculus by using classroom                       examples, illustrations, and applications that are compiled                     in the handbook. It is not the intention that the workshop is                   to be a course in calculus, as such, but rather an enriching                    and in-depth experience for the teachers with the goal that                     they in turn will be able to provide similar experiences for                    their students within the context of a full-year calculus                       course. Also, during that Summer, the handbook will be                          revised according to the reactions and input from the                           participants.",
