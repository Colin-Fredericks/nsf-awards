 "awd_abstract_narration": "An investigation of the potential for altering the boiling curve                through the effects of high velocity and high subcooling is proposed.           The emphasis of the research will be to design and perform experiments          using a single liquid, Freon 113, flowing over an electrically heated           cylinder in crossflow.  The goal will be to demonstrate whether the             unstable transition boiling region can be averted altogether under              high velocity and subcooling for this liquid.  The experiments will be          carried out in a flow loop capable of circulating liquids at high               volumetric flow rates.  An electrically heated thin-walled Hastelloy-C          cylinder, 0.635-cm in diameter, will be used as the test surface.  It           will be mounted in a 7.62 x 7.62 cm square test section.                                                                                                        This research considers aspects of convective boiling in the                    transition region.  The transition region of the boiling curve is               typically avoided due t instability of the phenomenon as well as the            lack of control of fluids under these conditions.  The proposal seeks           to entirely avert the transition region by employing a highly                   subcooled liquid at high velocities.  Evidence is presented in the              proposal to indicate that this conjecture has some justification, and           this experimental effort will quantify this phenomena.",
