 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Great Lakes Research Division of the University of Michigan will            acquire several items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in          a pool of shared use equipment.  This equipment is maintained for use           on or in association with the R/V LAURENTIAN, a research vessel owned           and operated by the University.  A substantial part of the ship's               operating schedule during 1988 is in support of NSF-sponsored research          projects.  The instrumentation will also increase the capabilities of           the ship and of the institution to support research and engineering             activities.  The instrumentation includes:                                                                                                                      -A piston corer for collecting core samples of sediments up to 15                meters in length for geological and paleoecological investigations,             and                                                                            -a survey quality echo sounder for profiling the bottom and for                  studying fish populations.                                                                                                                                     The instrumentation described above will increase the capability of             the University to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering                projects.  ***//",
