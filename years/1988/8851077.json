These modules            will be developed by the New York Board of Education staff in                   partnership with IBM for computer expertise, the New York Academy of            Sciences and Columbia University School of Engineering for technical            content guidance, and Hofstra & Hunter Colleges for input from research         on computer-aided learning.  Fourteen modules will prepared, test-              taught, revised as needed, and issued.  Teachers in each borough will be        given necessary training to allow introduction into the regular                 curriculum.   The modules will also be made available for dissemination         outside the New York City system.                                               Cost sharing by the New York City Board of Education and IBM will total         $195% of the NSF funding.",
