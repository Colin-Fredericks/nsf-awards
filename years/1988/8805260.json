 "awd_abstract_narration": "Enhancement, experimental analysis and evalution will be                   accomplished on an expert retrieval assistant named CONIT which                 seeks to capture and formalize some of the intelligence embodied                in a human expert searcher. In particular CONIT assists users in                developing a formalized problem description from which the                      system derives and executes a search strategy in one or more of                 400 databases in three different retrieval systems.  CONIT                      further assists the user in displaying document records and                     reformulating the search strategy based on search results and                   user desires.  New assistance techniques to be studied include                  (1) ranking documents by estimated relevance based on retrieval                 match criteria; (2) several means for search evaluation based on                estimates of recall plus time and cost parameters; and (3)                      selection of the most propitious search modification tactics for                the current problem context.  With these tools search strategy                  planning can be based on more rational, quantitative decision-                  making procedures as opposed to the more intuitive, qualitative                 procedures typical of current retrieval modalities.  Analysis of                experiments conducted will consider how well the particular                     techniques, and general retrieval models (subsumed under the term               \"smart Boolean\"), achieve these goals.  An improved human-                      computer interface will also be tested through conversion of the                CONIT system from a mainframe to a workstation environment.",
