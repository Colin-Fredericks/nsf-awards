 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides an opportunity for biology and chemistry secondary        school teachers to learn and use basic science concepts and theories as         employed in industry for developing curriculum units.  The project is           predicated on the thesis that a curriculum that is developed by teachers        from direct experience will induce changes more quickly in new teaching         strategies and produce more highly motivated students and a greater             understanding of science.                                                                                                                                       Visits to industries, agencies and natural sites are organized to               provide direct experience to teachers. These visits will be supplemented        by lectures and laboratory work conducted by university staff paired            with experienced high school science teachers.  Three week summer               workshops in chemistry and biology will be held during the summers of           1988 and 1989.  The activities will continue with 12 meetings during the        academic year.                                                                                                                                                  This project will assist in determining if familiarity with equipment           and practical applications of theories and concepts in applied settings         will build motivation for pursuing science careers.",
