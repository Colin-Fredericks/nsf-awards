 "awd_abstract_narration": "A study of the old stellar populations in galaxies will be                      carried out, mainly through an analysis of the integrated                       spectra of elliptical galaxies and globular clusters.  The                      stellar content of early-type galaxies will be studied through                  integrated light techniques previously developed.  The main focus               will be to make a comparative study of elliptical galaxies in                   dense clusters of galaxies versus galaxies in relatively isolated               regions.  The effect of environment on the formation and early                  evolution of these systems will be evaluated.  Related work will                be done on  the disks of spherical galaxies.  An exploration  of                the near-ultraviolet spectrum of elliptical galaxies will also be               carried out.  Globular clusters are often considered as crucial                 test cases for integrated light studies, but previous work has                  demonstrated an unexpected degree of complexity in their                        integrated spectra.  Several projects will be carried out to                    better understand this complex behavior.  An alternative to                     studying the old population in external galaxies is to carry out                a detailed study of the collapse and early chemical enrichment of               our Galaxy.  An objective prism survey of both galactic poles                   will be done.  The survey is designed to produce high-quality                   radial velocities and atmospheric parameters for a very large                   number of stars.  The perpendicular physical structure of our                   Galaxy in density, chemical composition, and kinematics will be                 determined.",
