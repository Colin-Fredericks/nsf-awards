 "awd_abstract_narration": "Community School District 4 has designed the Elementary Science                 Enhancement Project to address the issue of effective science                   instruction that meets the State mandate.  The purpose of this project          is to enhance the quality of science teaching and thus the increased            awareness and preparation of under represented elementary students in           East Harlem.  The project will, over three years impact upon 30                 supervisors, 500 teachers and 12,000 students.  In New York this comes          at a time when the State Education Department is introducing a new              elementary science syllabus requiring enhanced teacher competence and           \"hands-on\" involvement in science instruction.  The immediacy and extent        of need suggests an intervention model that operates at the level of            direct instruction (the school district); that is organized to meet the         in-service needs of current professional; that institutionalizes a              system of peer support, turnkey training and supervisory involvement in         every school; that develops a cadre of elementary science                       instructors/trainers for long term effectiveness; and that provides up-         to-date information and materials, drawing upon the support and                 expertise of educational publishers, private industry, curriculum               authors, scientists and science educators.  The project has a three-year        plan in which teachers leaders are trained along with building level            supervisors in order to provide on-going elementary science staff               development and collaboration on a district-wide basis.  The strategies         formulated by this project will be shared with the 31 other school              districts in New York City as a viable model for the implementation of          the new science syllabus.  The expertise developed in staff development         will be a valuable resource for New York City schools as well as the 700        other school districts throughout New York State.",
