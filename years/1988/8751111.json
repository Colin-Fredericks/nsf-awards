 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Learning Center (TNLC) incorporates informal learning with         self directed, engaging materials.  TNLC has produced, with a three year        grant, a multimedia elementary science learning Lab that uses tabletop          exhibits to create a mini-museum for students in grades four through            six.  The additional two years of funding will enable the project to            produce and field test four new Learning Lab units and two related              educational software packages.  Each unit will consist of about                 fifteen tabletop exhibits, student workbooks and a Teacher's guide.             Delta Education, Inc. will work closely with TNLC to ensure that each           new unit will become commercially available and will provide teacher            training.                                                                                                                                                       The National Learning Center is located in Washington, D.C. and is              engaged in a wide range of education activities.  It has an excellent           record and is one of the few cultural and educational institutions in           the nation that is totally integrated.                                                                                                                          This is a challenging project which addresses the goal of the                   Instructional Materials Program to support the development of improved          instructional materials for precollege classrooms.  The museum's                commitment is strong, the product well defined, the staff is highly             qualified and there is active participation of a publisher.                                                                                                     An award is recommended for the National Learning Center.",
