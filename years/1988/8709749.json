 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term objective in the proposed studies is to learn                more about the cytoskeletal elements associated with the cell                   membrane in eukaryotic cells, with particular reference to                      discovering the molecular basis for regional differentiation                    within and associated with such structures.  The basic approach                 will be to study four specific polypeptides which have been                     identified as core proteins within the membrane skeleton of the                 ciliated protozooan, Tetrahymena.  Though globally distributed,                 these proteins are concentrated and highly patterned within the                 oral apparatus.  The four polypeptides have been purified, and                  they will be characterized by antibodies, peptide mapping, in                   vitro assembly, and microsequencing.  These techniques will make                possible comparisons with vertebrate cytoskeletal proteins.  The                experiments will also set the stage for cellular studies on the                 formation and regulation of cell architecture in protozooans.                    This work has the potential for leading to significant insight                 into fundamental principles of cytoskeletal structure-function                  relationships.",
