 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funding for a workshop to identify,                 record and disseminate promising research directions in                         geometric modeling as applied in the broad area of computer-                    aided design (CAD) for the design and manufacture of products.                  Geometric modeling is central to engineering design and                         manufacturing.                                                                       In recent years, geometric modeling needs have changed                     dramatically.  The geometric aspects of CAD systems have                        evolved from line geometry to solid models which allow                          automated three dimensional color shaded graphics and automated                 analysis.  This progress has improved the detailed design portion               of the design-manufacturing process, but has done little for                    preliminary and conceptual design process.  For example, the                    present state of solid modeling research has not resolved the                   question of geometric representations about which the designer                  can reason. Geometric (form) features and design features in                    general show promise in making inroads into this \"reasoning\"                    question.  Much work needs to be done to formulate the issues and               focus on the most promising geometric representations for                       computer representation.                                                             Successful resolution of these research questions will                     contribute to the framework for technological progress in the                   promising new areas of conceptual design, design for life cycle                 requirements, and concurrent product and process design.                        Research progress in this area will contribute to changing the                  way design will be done in the future.                                               The role of this workshop is to focus attention on the                     essential research directions in geometric design which will                    enable the realization of such new design processes.",
