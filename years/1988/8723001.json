 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant, funded jointly by Special Projects in Chemistry and                 the Division of Materials Research provides support for the                     research of Profs. Schwartz and Bernasek at Princeton                           University. The objective of the interdisciplinary research is                  to synthesize and characterize controlled interfaces between                    metal oxides and organometallic complex-derived overlayers.                     Synthetic interfaces of this type are germane to catalysis,                     electrode surfaces and packaging applications.                                                                                                                  The interfacial layer which this research will create is                        conceptually different from that which exists in common                         interfaces in that rather than relying on physical adhesion,                    these interfaces would involve covalent interactions between                    components in the composite. The feasibility of the synthetic                   approach which is based on organometallic chemistry, has                        already been performed either on bulk oxide substrates under                    normal conditions or in ultrahigh vacuum using single-crystal                   supports.  The use of single-crystal supports enables an                        investigation of the nature and extent of covalent interactions                 between an overlayer and the surface of a support. Development                  of analogous methodology for bulk oxides will enable the                        preparation of materials which can be studied with regard to                    their bulk physical and chemical properties.",
