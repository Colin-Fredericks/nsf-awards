 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS) is convening a major                international symposium in tropical studies in June 1988 to                     celebrate the Silver Anniversary of its founding.  The symposium                will last one week and will consist of a North American segment                 and a second part in Costa Rica where most OTS field activities                 have historically been located.  Appropriately, the North                       American part of the symposium will be hosted by the University                 of Miami where OTS was founded in 1963.  The unifying theme of                  the U.S. portion of the symposium will be Resource Availability                 and the Structure and Functioning of Tropical Ecosystems.  Six                  plenary sessions will address the following topics: I. Soil                     fertility, nutrient cycling, and the decomposer food web; II.                   Resource availability and plant community structure; III.                       Resource availability and plant-herbivore interactions; IV.                     Resource availability and food-web structure; V.  Resource                      availability and muturalisms; VI. Resource availability and the                 conservation of biotic diversity in the tropics.  The Costa Rican               sessions will include: Addresses from representatives of OTS and                from the government of Costa Rica, awards to winners of contests                with tropical conservation themes, a series of presentations on                 research, sustainable use and conservation issues and a series of               field trips to areas of biotic interest.                                                                                                                        The organizers for this symposium have done a truly excellent job               that will make the OTS 25th anniversary observance a memorable                  scientific event.  The Programs of the Division of Biotic Systems               and Resources take pride in recommending funding.",
