 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action will provide funds for two faculty, two                        research associates and four to five students to continue their                 research in elementary particle physics with accelerator                        facilities at Fermilab.                                                              1.  A continuation of a series of experiments \u0131E594 and                    E733! to investigate neutrino interactions.  The goals include                  measurement of a basic parameter in the theory of electro-weak                  interactions \u0131the Weinberg angle! and a detailed understanding                  of the weak interaction involving no change in electric charge                  \u0131neutral currents, in particular the measurement of weak                        neutral current structure functions!.                                                2.  Collaboration in the fabrication and preliminary                       operation of the D0 detector (E740) to be used at the world's                   highest energy colliding beam facility.  About 150 physicists                   are involved in this project, the principal responsibility of                   the Michigan State group is the design and fabrication of a                     fast trigger system capable of selecting the events for                         detailed analysis from the many less interesting events.  The                   scientific interest is to make detailed and precise tests of                    the model of electro-weak interactions known as \"the standard                   model\".  The standard model accurately describes the electro-                   weak interactions observed to date but is known to have                         validity limited to the energies below a few hundred TeV.  The                  D0 experiment will  probe the standard model at energies higher                 than available in the past.",
