 "awd_abstract_narration": "Standardized test results indicate gender differences in mathematics            achievement on the secondary level, with boys consistently outperforming        their female peers.  This study will focus on the talented mathematics          student, enrolled in Advanced Placement BC Calculus.  Its objective will        be to examine, by way of a true experiment, gender differences in               classroom interaction patterns, student perceptions of themselves as            learners of mathematics, and achievement in advanced high school                mathematics.  The uniqueness and import of the project lies in the              random assignment of subjects to single-sex and coeducational classes           following identical curriculum strategies and plans.  From the                  investigation of differential effects of classroom social environments          on adolescent males and females will come further elucidation of the            aids and obstacles to successful mathematics learning.  As a final              outcome of the study, those insights will be translated into practical          proposals for general use with students in advanced mathematics courses         on the secondary level.",
