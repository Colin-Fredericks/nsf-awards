 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides modest support to enable expertise on ethical               and value aspects of research and education in advanced computing               to be incorporated into two technical and policy symposia --                    called \"Directions and Implications of Advanced Computing\"                      (DIAC), sponsored by Computer Professionals for Social                          Responsibility.  CPSR is a national professional organization                   with over 2200 members.  The symposia will be held in the summers               of 1988 and 1989.  The 1988 symposium will take place on August                 21, in the Earle Brown Center at the University of Minnesota -                  St. Paul.  This is the day before the national conference of the                American Association for Artificial Intelligence begins there.                  The symposium will include six presented papers, a plenary                      address, and a panel on \"How are ethical values imparted and                    sustained in the computing community?\"  For 1989, the program                   committee will include a philosopher who specializes in the study               of computer ethics and a social scientist who studies the                       influence of values in the selection of research priorities.                    Plans will expand the publicity and outreach of the symposia to                 improve the exchange and interaction between technical                          professionals and scholars and the dissemination of materials to                lay audiences.  Results from each symposium will include a book                 and journal publications.  Editorials, commentaries, and                        educational materials may also be prepared.                                                                                                                     This project is undertaken by competent professionals with                      appropriate organizational support.  Collaborative efforts are                  likely to continue well beyond the period of this award.  The                   project is designed well; plans for review and dissemination of                 materials are appropriate.  An award in the amount of $6,000 is                 recommended.",
