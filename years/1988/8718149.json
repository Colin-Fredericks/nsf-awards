 "awd_abstract_narration": "The origin and identity of low molecular weight organic acids in                soils will be studied in coniferous ecosystems in the Pacific                   Northwest.  These acids along with fulvic acids may drive the                   soil formation process, podsolization, in these ecosystems.  Some               of these acids may control the availability of Ca and Al to                     plants from soil solution.  The work could go a long way toward                 explaining the tolerance of conifers to high Al soils and to the                maintenance of available Ca in the rhizosphere under these                      conditions.  The work is also significant to understanding what                 controls the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and Al                  that move from the soil to streams in the forested landscape.                                                                                                   Three potential sources of organic acids will be examined; root                 exudates, decaying organic matter, and mycorrhizal fungi.  Both                 field and laboratory studies of organic acid sources will be                    undertaken.  Field research will include comparison of organic                  acids in soils of root-free and control plots.  Soil solutions                  will be sampled by lysimetry and extractions.                                                                                                                   A variety of state-of-the-art techniques will be used to identify               low molecular weight acids.  These techniques include gas                       chromatography, high pressure liquid chromatography and GC/MS.                  The forms in which Al exist in the soil-root matrix will be                     determined using a special application of electron microscopy.                                                                                                  Dr. Ugolini has an outstanding research record in this area.  The               institutional support available to him at the University of                     Washington is first-rate.",
