 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research on this project will be carried out by two                    investigators, the principal investigator Herve Jacquet and his                 postdoctoral associate Michael Heumos.  Jacquet will continue                   his efforts at  generalizing his new trace formula.  Results on                 special values of L-functions, the determination of the residual                spectrum of the general linear group and a better understanding                 of the Weil representation are among the long range goals of the                project.  Heumos will study models for unitary representations of               GLn over a p-adic field.  These models generalize the standard                  Whittaker model and are subgroups of GLn.  Examples suggest that                perhaps all unitary representations embed uniquely in a unique                  model.  This would provide a new perspective to the study of                    unitary representations of the p-adic GLn and would have                        widespread applications.                                                             This research is in the area of number theory commonly known               as the \"Langland's program\".  It applies advanced notions from                  many areas, most especially modern analysis, to answer                          fundamental questions in arithmetic.",
