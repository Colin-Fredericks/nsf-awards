 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is a continuation of an interdisciplinary                 collaboration on the structure, dynamics, and physiology of                     proteins which bind and degrade juvenile hormone (JH) and JH                    mimics (JHM).  The original goals of this collaborative research                were to develop chemical and biochemical techniques to approach                 the molecular biology of juvenile hormone (JH) reception and                    catabolism.  These initial objectives have been acheived, and in                this renewal request, further goals are proposed:  First, to                    study the structure of the JH and JHM binding proteins  (JHBP an                RP) in Manduca larval epidermal cell cytosol and nuclei, and of                 JH esterases (JHE) and epoxide hydrolases (JHEH) through (a)                    synthesis of radioligands, (b) JHBP/RP and JHE/EH purification                  and sequencing, (c) active site labeling and sequencing, (d)                    antibody production, (e) gene isolation and sequencing, and (f)                 overproduction of proteins;  second, to examine the dynamics of                 the ligands and macromolecules, including (a) timing and location               of JHBP/RP, JHE/EH, (b) movement of hormones and proteins between               cell compartments, and (c) protein-ligand, protein-protein, and                 protein-DNA interactions.  A key to the structure and dynamics                  goals will be the development of a baculovirus expression system                in Bombyx for protein overproduction.  The third goal is to                     correlate structure and dynamics with physiology by                             characterizing, (a) the appearance of JHBP/RP and JHE/EH in the                 life cycle, and (b) comparative biochemistry of JHBP/RP and                     JHE/EH in insects, with respect to ligand recognition and protein               similarities.                                                                                                                                                   The characterization of receptor proteins for juvenile hormone                  (JH) and JH mimics (JHM) and knowledge of the pathways of their                 degradation are major keys to understanding the molecular basis                 for hormonal regulation of gene expression in insects.  This                    research is an interdisciplinary collaboration which combines                   expertise in molecular biology and physiological manifestations                 of gene expression in insects (L. M. Riddiford), biochemical and                molecular studies of JH metabolism (B. D. Hammock), and synthesis               and use of high specific activity labeled JHs and JHMs (G. D.                   Prestwich).  This proposal was submitted under the NSF initiative               in the Chemistry of Life Processes.",
