 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many ingredients are required for the formation of severe weather           in the central and eastern parts of the United States.  One of these            factors, which is most difficult to forecast, is the timing and                 location of the return of warm, moist, unstable air from the Gulf of            Mexico.                                                                             This research is part of a larger National Oceanic and Atmospheric          Administration (NOAA) led project which seeks to improve understanding          of the modification of cold air outbreaks as they move over the warm            Gulf waters.  Of particular interest are the nature of this airmass             modification and the factors which control it.  A combined modelling            and observational approach is planned including a small field program.          Observational systems will include the NOAA P-3 research aircraft,              supplemental soundings from National Weather Service (NWS) upper air            stations and satellite data.  Four Cross-chain Loran Atmospheric                Sounding Systems (CLASS) from the National Science Foundation                   sponsored National Center for Atmospheric Research will be used to              improve the spatial density of the sounding information available from          the NWS sites.  Three of these systems will be placed in the Gulf of            Mexico -- two aboard research vessels and one on an oil drilling                platform.  The data collected from this ensemble of instrumentation             will be the most complete to date on airmass modification over the              Gulf.",
