 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to provide students an opportunity to          conduct experiments with biological phenomena at the cellular and               molecular levels.  The major new equipment includes a Nikon                     fluorescence microscope-camera system, a cryostat, and computer                 equipment linked to the fluorescence microscope through a closed-               circuit video system for image analysis.                                                                                                                             Fluorescence markers are used to study , e.g., human, animal and           plant chromosomes, cellular development and brain pathways.  Some               current student research projects involve the activation of genes in            the hippocampus, tracing neural pathways in the brain, verification of          success of transplantation of adrenal medulla tissue to the brain,              sexual differentiation in the spinal cord, and analysis of muscle cell          changes following the administration of anabolic steroids and exercise.         The computer equipment is being linked to the fluorescence microscope           and image analysis programs written to support the various experimental         protocols.  Students can explore the molecular basis of life in the             laboratory, becoming proficient with equipment that is linked to                computer systems while experiencing the increased experimental design           and analysis capabilities available through such systems.                                                                                                            This new equipment is enhancing biological laboratory work in              Physiology, Genetics and Evolution, Introduction to Biology, and                undergraduate student research.  The grantee institution is matching            the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
