 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adult Djungarian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) exhibit multiple                  reproductive and thermoregulatory adjustments to a short day                    photoperiod.  However, some individuals in the laboratory population            fail to use this photoperiod information.  Since photoperiod time               measurement in mammals has a circadian basis, the applicant examined            short day sensitive (=responders) and insensitive (=nonresponders)              individuals to determine if differences in circadian function exist             between these phenotypes.  Under constant environmental conditions we           found 4 differences in circadian function in the nonresponders.  As a           group they exhibited: 1) a longer free running period under DD, 2) a            shorter duration of activity, 3) a phase response curve which has few           phase delays, and 4) less 'splitting' in their activity rhythm under            LL.  He has also established that there is a genetic basis for these            phenotypic differences and has developed genetic lines to understand            which aspects of circadian organization are critical for proper                 photoperiod time measurement.  The first experiment examines between            line difference in circadian function under constant environmental              conditions, while the second emphasizes entrainment to non-24 h light:          dark cycles.",
