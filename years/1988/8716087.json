 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of eight U.S.                         scientists in a seminar on Electromagnetic Interference in                      Highly Advanced Social Systems, organized jointly by Professor                  Stephen Sebo of Ohio State University and Professor Tatsuo                      Kawamura of the University of Tokyo, Japan.  United States,                     Japanese and invited third-country participants will meet in                    Honolulu, Hawaii during August 1988.  The seminar will focus on                 understanding of electromagnetic pulses caused by power                         transmission systems, natural lightnings and nuclear explosions;                measurement techniques of electromagnetic fields covering a                     broad frequency range, including procedures and standardization;                and,the environmental effects of hazardous electromagnetic                      fields and their impact on society.                                                                                                                             Many key elements of highly advanced social systems (e.g.,                      electric power systems, communication and information systems,                  national security) are sensitive to electromagnetic                             interference.  Yet, the nature of such interferences, and their                 biological and societal impacts, have never been systematically                 addressed.  This seminar will provide a forum for the exchange                  of research results and ideas.  Discussions on the                              standardization of measuring techniques and the evaluation of                   measured results should prove particularly valuable in advancing                the field.",
