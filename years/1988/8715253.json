 "awd_abstract_narration": "The most obvious signs of plant senescence are the withering                    and eventual death of flowers, fruits, leaves and roots.                        Senescence is regulated by complex processes involving                          environmental, physiological and genetic factors whose                          mechanisms are incompletely known.  In this project, a unique                   model will be developed for the study of plant senescence,                      with the eventual goal of elucidating the molecular                             mechanisms.  Plant senescence is important to the overall                       economy of the plant, fruit and grain ripening, crop                            production, and post-harvest storage of crops.                                                                                                                  Chloroplasts in mesophyll cells of Nicotiana glauca lose                        functionality during leaf senescence, but those in stomatal                     guard cells do not.  In this project, mesophyll and guard                       cells will be cultured in ways that preserve the unique                         properties of the differentiated cell types.  To optimize                       cell survival and preservation of physiological properties                      unique to each cell type, a variety of nutrient, osmotic, pH,                   light, and cell density conditions will be tested.  Once                        cultures are established, conditions will be identified for                     fusing protoplasts from the two cell types and for culturing                    fusion hybrids.  The functionality of guard cell chloroplasts                   in fusion hybrids will be monitored by                                          microfluorospectrophotometry to determine whether senescing                     mesophyll cells contain factors capable of initiating guard                     cell chloroplast senescence.***//",
