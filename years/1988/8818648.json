 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to formulate a stochastic finite element procedure to           study the static and dynamic behaviors of complex structures, with              emphasis on thin shell structural uncertainties under random                    earthquake load.                                                                                                                                                Structural uncertainties such as initial geometric imperfections,               material properties, boundary conditions, and structural damping                coefficients, etc. and random loads are considered.                                                                                                             The main objectives are:  (1) to extend the formulation of an                   existing curved quadrilateral thin shell element with deterministic             imperfections and geometrical and material nonlinearities to include            random imperfections and other structural uncertainties; (2) to                 codify the formulation to study the combined effects of several                 structural uncertainties on static analysis; (3) to develop a solution          procedure within the framework of stochastic finite element                     approach and equivalent linearization technique, which simultaneously           accounts for the effects of several structural uncertainties in spatial         domain and temporal random loadings; (4) to study the dynamic                   response and dynamic buckling behaviors of thin complex structures              subjected to earthquake load.                                                                                                                                   The effort will lead to the development of a design methodology                 reliability analysis of practical complex structures with structural            uncertainties subjected to random earthquake load.",
