 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most                       powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                   the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                     substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                  molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                    molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                          spectroscopy is essential to chemists who are carrying out                      frontier research.                                                                                                                                              This award, co-supported by the Chemistry Shared                                Instrumentation Program and the Research Improvement in                         Minority Institutions (RIMI) Program, will help the Department                  of Chemistry of the University of New Mexico to acquire a                       low-field NMR spectrometer.  The spectrometer will afford                       modern instrumentation for a student body that contains a                       considerable minority component (largely Hispanic).  The areas                  of research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include:                                                                                                   1)  Solution structural studies of organometallic and main                          group cluster and ring compounds                                                                                                                            2)  NMR studies of the cytochrome C peroxidase-cytochrome C                         redox complex                                                                                                                                               3)  Synthetic organic chemistry in the elucidation of sterol                        metabolism.",
