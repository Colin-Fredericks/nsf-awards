 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several questions in two broad observational areas will be              addressed:  (1) the intrinsic line and continuum properties of                  QSOs, and (2) the physical properties of the QSO absorption line                systems which arise in intervening material.  The goal of the                   work in the first area is to gain a better understanding of the                 continuum energy production processes in QSOs, through                          observation of the spectral energy distributions of a large                     number of objects from the X-ray to the far IR, and modeling of                 the accretion disk and nonthermal components.  Further clues to                 the nature of the continuum production regions are given by                     monitoring the variability of mildly variable objects, to see                   which spectral components vary together, and which vary                         separately.  The goal of the work in the second area is to                      understand the physical conditions and origins of the clouds                    which give rise to the QSO absorption lines, by obtaining very                  high resolution spectra of high redshift QSOs.  The types of                    systems to be studied include the Lyman or forest lines, which                  may arise in primordial or protogalactic gas clouds, the metal                  line systems which probably arise in the halos or disks of                      galaxies, and the very thick damped Lyman or systems, which                     probably arise in galaxy disks.                                                         Interactive activities include teaching a special topics                course in astronomy, giving guest lectures in introductory                      astronomy courses, participating in the University honors                       program, joining the colloquium committee to bring women speakers               to the University, and giving public lectures at the University                 planetarium.                                                                            This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1)              to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                  engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF                  and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and                     engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists                and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic                    institutions.  By encouraging the participation of women in                     science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future                     scientific vitality.",
