The conference is under the auspices of the                    Federation of the American Societies of Experimental Biology                    (FASEB).  There will be nine major sessions with 36 invited                     speakers and poster sessions.  The topics to be covered                         are:  Transcription (including cis determinants, transacting                    regulating elements, and in vitro systems), Translation and                     translational regulation, Splicing (including self-splicing                     systems, intron-encoded maturases, nuclear splicing, in                         vitro systems, and regulation by splicing),                                     Retro-transposition (the Tyl system, and RNA Replication                        (including single and double-stranded RNA \"viruses\" and in                      vitro systems).  The focus will be on yeast as the leading                      model eukaryotic system.                                                                                                                                        This meeting is important and relevant in that yeast is one                     of the most powerful of all experimental organisms and RNA                      has been recently found to have new and unexpected functions                    within the cell.  This meeting will bring together                              scientists who are involved with studies of RNA in the yeast                    system who might otherwise have little interaction.",
