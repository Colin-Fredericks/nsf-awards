 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves a cooperative effort among the institutions of            the Atlanta University Center (Atlanta University, Clark College,               Morehouse College, Morris Brown College, and Spelman College), together         with Georgia State, Georgia Tech and the Atlanta Public Schools.  It            consists of a set of coordinated activities, targeted initially                 throughout Metropolitan Atlanta, designed to significantly increase the         representation of minorities in careers in science, engineering and             technology.  The broad-based approach taken to solve the                        underrepresentation problem centers on the establishment of coalitions          among colleges, public schools and community organizations.  The                activities include formal education during the precollege and                   undergraduate years and informal science education for all ages from            early childhood through the adult years.  A set of coordinated                  activities are being implemented, with responsibilities distributed             among the several institutions and organizations.  For example,                 Saturday Science Academies for elementary students will be established          at several of the institutions (patterned on the model developed at             Clark College) and summer enrichment institutes will be taught by teams         of faculty from the Atlanta University Center, Georgia State and                Georgia Tech.  At the undergraduate level, Georgia Tech will play the           lead role in a six-week summer enrichment program for minority students         in engineering following their freshman year, while Georgia State, with         a major role in teacher education, will be responsible for developing           and implementing the 5-year MAT and M.S. programs.  The informal                science education component, developed cooperatively with other Atlanta         groups, e.g. APPLE Corps and Zoo Atlanta, involves a number of                  activities such as: \"Science is for Everybody\" consisting of portable           learning units based on permanent exhibits from Atlanta's major                 science/technology centers; Science and Technology Programs for Boys            Clubs and Girls Clubs; and Community Forums on Effective Schools. A             central project focus is on instructional strategies which will                 nurture, encourage and motivate students within the context of science          experiences.                                                                                                                                                    This project is an excellent example of a Comprehensive Regional                Center for Minorities.  It is targeted at a minority population of              substantial size (600,000), and it is comprehensive in terms of                 attention to the various educational levels and age groups, in                  disciplinary coverage, in coordination and cooperation among school             systems, colleges and universities and community organizations, and in          its focus on nurturing, encouraging and motivating minority students.           Significant additional financial support is being contributed to the            project by the participating organizations and groups.",
