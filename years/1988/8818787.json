 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description: This project will support up to nine U.S.                          scientists to participate in a U.S.-Pakistan workshop to                        discusss research needs both in biotechology and in                             conventional areas to enhance the productivity and quality                      of oilseed crops.  The U.S. team leader is Dr. Milton                           Gordon, Department of Biochemistry, University of                               Washington, Seattle, and the Pakistani team leader is Dr.                       S. Riazuddin, Director, Center for Advanced Molecular                           Biology, University of Punjab, Lahore.  The meeting is                          supported by the Pakistan Agricultural Research Center                          (ARC) and the University Grants Commission (UGC).  The                          areas to be represented by the participants include                             biochemistry, plant physiology, molecular biology, plant                        breeding, agronomy and agricultural planning.  The problems                     to be tackled include tolerance to harsh soil/water/weather                     conditions, susceptability to various diseases, resistance                      to insects, and the value of the product for various uses.                      A national meeting of Pakistani experts  will generate a                        report on the qualitative and quantitative dimensions of                        these problems . This report will be made available to the                      workshop  participants well in advance of their meeting.                        The workshop papers and recommendations for research                            projects will be published in a proceedings.                                                                                                                    Scope: The U.S. participants are well known experts in                          their research fields and have considerable experience in                       developmental work for improving agricultural products.                         The Pakistani coperating scientist is one of that country's                     leading biologist, with considerable experience in                              molecular biology and in coordinating activities similar to                     this project.  The support of the Pakistan ARC is very                          important because of the significat scientific resources it                     has, and to give the results of this project the weight                         necessary for future action by the Pakistani side on joint                      projects.",
