 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to understand the behavior of                 electrons at interfaces, in glasses, and in other structures                    where crystallinity is either absent or reduced, and thereby                    explain structural, vibrational, and electronic properties of                   many materials.  This will be done by extending the Recursion                   Library, a collection of Fortran programs for solving the                       equations of electronic motion in non-crystalline materials, to                 gausssian basis sets, to applications of the local density                      approximation, and to applications of the GW method for                         calculating excitation energies of solids.  The recursion method                will be applied to the theory of small circuits, electronic                     states near interfaces, surface adhesion in layered compounds,                  and the effect of dirt on the bandstructure of a crystal.  The                  new idea of a conserved momentum in certain glass structuress                   will be explored.  The understanding of electronic structure and                its consequences in non-crystalline materials is an important                   step in the development of quantum mechanics and in the                         technological application of these materials.",
