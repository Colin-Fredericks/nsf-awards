 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies assessing the effects of race and ethnic group identity on              political behavior are recognized as important components of a general          theory of citizen political participation.  These studies have                  investigated ethnic voting patterns and have found high levels of               ethnic vote cohesion.  In addition, they have examined patterns of              ethnic political mobilization stemming from the development of an               ethnic political culture which stresses high levels of political                involvement among ethnic identifiers independent of each identifier's           socio-economic status.                                                                                                                                          Although many of these investigations have been useful in illustrating          outcomes from ethnic involvement in American Politics, they have failed         to provide a theoretical link between ethnic identity and political             participation.  As a result, little attention has been directed toward          assessing why, and the conditions under which ethnic group identity             affects political attitudes and behavior.                                                                                                                       This planning grant activity of the Minority Research Initiation                Program is directed at filling this void.  The researcher develops a            theoretical framework for understanding how ethnic group identity               shapes political behavior and formulates a survey questionnaire for             acquiring information on elite and small attitudes and behavior.  The           researcher also develops a political profile of Asian, Black, and               Hispanic communities in Los Angeles, California and analyzes                    the structure of networks operating in these communities.  Finally, in          order to assess mobilization and cohesion in ethnic communities, the            researcher devotes attention to the identification of salient issues            and causes within each community.",
