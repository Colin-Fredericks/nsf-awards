 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of U.S. researchers in a              seminar on warm-core rings organized jointly by Drs. Peter Wiebe                and Terrence Joyce of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and              Professor Takahisa Nemoto of the Ocean Research Institute,                      University of Tokyo, Japan.  Participants will meet in October 1988             at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Woods Hole,                        Massachusetts for an exchange of research results and ideas on the              physics, chemistry, and biology of oceanic warm-core rings which                form in the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio and other western boundary                    current regions.  The seminar will consist of oral presentations of             results, working group discussions of particular multidisciplinary              problems associated with ring structure and dynamics, a summary                 session, and preparation of a report.  Topics of discussion will                include ring formation, structure and evolution, and the                        differences in ring characteristics between different western                   boundary current regimes.                                                                                                                                       This seminar will be a successor to the very successful workshop on             oceanic rings held in Tokyo at the Ocean Research Institute in                  1985, also under the auspices of the U.S.-Japan Cooperative Science             Program.  Knowledge of the structure and dynamics  of the Gulf                  Stream warm rings has been greatly advanced since the last workshop             as a result of studies carried out by the Warm-Core Rings Program.              Similarly, extensive new data are available on rings in the                     Kuroshio system as a result of several recent multidisciplinary                 research  cruises from Japan.  The 1988 seminar will provide a                  useful forum for the exchange of current research results and                   should result in more cooperative research among U.S. and Japanese              oceanographers.",
