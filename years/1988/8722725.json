 "awd_abstract_narration": "Federal bureaucracies operate in an environment of competing                    forces - political, economic and organizational - at every                      level from federal to local.  This research addresses the                       question of how and to what extent the enforcement actions of                   federal bureaucracies respond to the local environment in which                 enforcement actions take place.  Through her doctoral                           dissertation, under the direction of Dr. Scholz, Ms. Headrick                   will examine safety enforcement by the Occupational Safety and                  Health Administrtaion (OSHA).  The study extends existing work                  on enforcement bureaucracies by analyzing the interaction of                    city politics and federal agency behavior, using detailed local                 level measures not available at other levels of analysis to map                 more explicitly the mechanisms linking variables already                        studied.  It analyzes hypotheses from three literatures -                       implementation, regulation and urban politics - at the city                     level.  Using both quantitative and qualitative analysis,                       hypotheses tested reveal how these forces affect the incentives                 of \"street-level\" enforcers - OSHA inspectors - that increase                   or reduce the enforcement level.  The project holds substantial                 promise of advancing our understanding of how bureaucratic                      actions respond to internal and external pressures.  The                        resulting effects on bureaucratric accountability, and in this                  case, the process of legal enforcement, also will be                            elucidated.",
