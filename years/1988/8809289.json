 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this study are to develop, assess and disseminate             measures of occupational prestige, replicating the prestige scores              generated for occupations in the United States in the 1960s.  The               scales developed at that time are widely used but out of date.  The             proposed study will include (1) formal replication -- with selected             improvements -- of the original 1960 prestige study, but with more              occupations, more respondents, and titles generated for and from the            1980 Census classification system, and (2) begin some preliminary               investigations of trends in occupational prestige over time.  These             objectives will be accomplished by adding a supplementary set of                questions to an on-going national survey of a representative sample of          adults, the General Social Survey.  The goal is to develop a prestige           index that is both improved and up-to-date, reflecting current public           consensus as to the ranking of occupations.                                                                                                                     \"Prestige\" is a theoretical concept that has generated studies of               upward (and downward) social mobility both within and across                    generations.  The rationale for recalibrating the prestige scales rests         on (a) the need for new estimates, given the dramatic changes in 1980           Census classification system relative to prior versions; (b) the need           to generate estimates for many new titles, not in existence in the              1960s; and (c) substantive interest in the question of stability and            change in prestige evaluations, a core feature of the American value            system.  This project will produce a valuable prestige index for use by         the social science community at large.",
