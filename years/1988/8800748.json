 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of the principal                     investigator in a combined shipboard/aircraft sampling                          expedition identified as WATOX-CASE (Western Atlantic Ocean                     Coordinated Air-Sea Experiment).  The ship and the aircraft                     operations are supported by the National Oceanic and                            Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for their ongoing research                    operations.  The principal investigator of this NSF project                     will be accommodated aboard the NOAA research ship.                                  The overall WATOX-CASE project will combine the work of                    NOAA scientists with the efforts of several university                          scientists, including the principal investigator for this                       grant, who, as a guest on the NOAA research ship, will use this                 opportunity to work toward his own particular goal to clarify                   sulfur conversion mechanisms.                                                        Specifically, the NSF investigator will do size-segretated                 measurements of aerosol sulfate and other ions, and will                        collaborate in collecting and analyzing for up to 50 chemical                   elements in fine- and coarse-fraction aerosols taken on                         shipboard.  Size-spectrum measurements will also be a part of                   the shipboard work.  Some work will be included on the                          elemental analysis of samples taken by aircraft.                                     The data arising from this NSF project will be of general                  interest to atmospheric chemists seeking to understand                          processes occurring in the marine boundary layer, and the                       collection of these data is the principal objective of the                      grant.",
