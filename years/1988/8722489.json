 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports three short term research visits by Dr. Peter               Peterson of Iowa State University to the Max-Planck Institute for               Plant Breeding Research in Cologne, FRG, to enhance his domestic                research by collaboration with Dr. Heinz Saedler and others.  The               objective of their joint work is to gain a better understanding of              the regulation of transposition and gene expression in maize.  Their            research plans include efforts to 1) investigate further the                    relationship of newly arisen unstable alleles to currently known                mutable systems; 2) analyze the En system by isolating mutants                  controlling the several specific functions of the En element;                   3) pursue the genetic analysis of mutable alleles at several loci in            order to isolate mutant derivatives for additional molecular                    studies; 4) analyze populations of maize for the distribution of                mutable elements; and 5) trap master elements at cloned loci for                their use in tagging genes.  A coordinated genetic (Iowa) and                   molecular (Germany) approach is necessary for most of this work.                Dr. Peterson has all the facilities and genetic information and                 techniques to manipulate the genetic material.  Dr. Saedler's group             has the molecular biology technology well developed and has                     personnel to carry out the molecular level analyses.                                                                                                            Studies of mobile elements in maize have made considerable progress             in the past few years, with the isolation and cloning of several                elements and the subsequent cloning of a number of genes.  This                 progress is attributable to the combined efforts of molecular                   biologists and geneticists, including these collaborators.  Early               work has elucidated the general structure of the elements, their                component parts, and their genetic effects.  This work has generated            the development of models to explain the role of these elements in              inducing changes in the genome as well as in individual genes.  The             proposed collaboration will carry this work further, leading                    eventually to experiments on tagging desirable genes that are                   important to agriculture.",
