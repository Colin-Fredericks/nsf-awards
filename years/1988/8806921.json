 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is mathematical research sponsored by a                       Research at Undergraduate Institutions award.  The subject is                   linear operators on Banach spaces, the latter being (generally)                 infinite-dimensional versions of the finite-dimensional space in                which we live.  In general, it is easy for a linear operator to                 be discontinuous, that is, not to preserve limits; this is a                    feature of infinite dimensionality. It is therefore remarkable                  that under certain cirumstances, an operator that merely                        satisfies a particular algebraic identity turns out automatically               to be continuous.  The principal investigator will seek automatic               continuity results of this nature within a framework described by               the spectral theory of operators.                                                    His research will help him provide intellectual leadership                 to the mathematics department of his institution, Southwest                     Missouri State University, thereby improving the environment for                undergraduate students seeking to learn mathematics.",
