 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scientific staff of the American Museum of Natural                     History needs a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to replace an                older model which is frequently inoperative and does not meet all               the needs of the researchers.  The instrument is in constant use                during most of the year and is usually booked one month in                      advance.  This back-up stems from heavy usage and the need for                  frequent repair.                                                                     The new instrument will provide improved image resolution;                 the ability to study a greater variety of specimens; enhanced                   picture quality; and a greater variety of photographic and                      electronic recording techniques.  The new instrument will also                  give researchers the ability to study and identify chemical                     distributions in the specimens they examine, giving them deeper                 understanding of the nature of those specimens.                                      Many projects are planned for the new instrument including                 studies of the symbionts of giant amoebae (foraminifera);                       systematics of ammonites, moss animals (bryozoa), pomace fies,                  fungus gnats, mice, rats, and termites; fish dentines; living and               fossil sharks; tiny spiders; and jade and asbestos mineralogy.",
