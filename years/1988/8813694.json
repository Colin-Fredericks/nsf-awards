 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops a solution technique for economic dynamic models.         A solution procedure of this type makes it possible to simulate models          on a computer.  Dynamic models are ones that evolve through time and,           thus, they are most appropriate for economic policy analysis.                   Simulating a dynamic model on the computer makes it possible to analyze         the properties of the model, and to test if it is a good description of         the real economy.  Ultimately, computer simulations can determine the           effect of a particular change in economic policy, and they can provide          guidance in policy-making.  In this project a technique for finding             numerical solutions is developed and applied to several models.                                                                                                 Recently, finding numerical solution procedures for dynamic economic            models has become an important issue.  The main challenges to these             procedures are computational tractability and accuracy.  Computational          tractability means that the algorithms allow for fast computation, so           that it is feasible to simulate interesting models without having to            spend too much time and money on the computer.  Also, since all of              these methods only approximate the true solution, it is necessary to            make sure that the solution is computed with a reasonable degree of             accuracy.  For a class of important models, the method developed in             this project is likely to improve on the existing methods both in terms         of computational speed and in terms of accuracy.",
