 "awd_abstract_narration": "The microcomputer hardware and software provided through this              project are adding versatility to existing laboratory equipment and             providing a new dimension to the science curriculum.  It allows for the         interfacing of microcomputers and transducers with existing hardware so         that these two-year college students can perform laboratory experiments         with greater rapidity, thus gaining more time for the interpretation of         data, for better data analysis and for critical evaluation of the               experimental designs and scientific methods being employed.  Students           are able to pursue independent problems and projects closer to the true         nature of work done in professional scientific laboratories.                                                                                                         The video camera supplements students' individual use of lab               microscopes, enabling the instructor to illustrate important                    microscopic concepts by projecting permanent or wet-mount slides so             that they may be examined and discussed by all students at the same             time.  Life activities of microorganisms also can be observed                   simultaneously in the group setting.                                                                                                                               All the new equipment provides students with greater opportunities           to experience inquiry-centered instruction, thus helping them to build          critical thinking skills.  The grantee institution is matching the NSF          award with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
