The                     research involves three main directions of analysis:  (1) to                    assimilate the disparate strands of the (primarily Western)                     efficiency literature into a status report on the measurement and               analysis of Soviet economic efficiency; (2) to assess the                       efficiency potential of the Soviet economic system by extending                 existing theoretical and empirical analysis; and (3) to evaluate                the implications of Gorbachev's unfolding reforms from the                      standpoint of the efficiency potential of the system.                                                                                                           The methodology being developed and applied in this project has                 broad applicability in economics.  The collaborative effort                     should provide a better formal picture of the emerging Soviet                   economic arrangements, at the same time that it acquaints some                  influential Soviet economists with state-of-the-art Western                     analysis.",
