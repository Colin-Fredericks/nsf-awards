 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering equipment project provides a quasi-elastic light               scattering (QELS) device needed for five on-going research                      projects conducted by four faculty members in the areas of                      colloidal, polymer, biochemical and pharmaceutical research.  The               first (supported by DOE), deals with drag reduction in surfactant               systems for use in district heating and district cooling systems.               The second (supported by NSF through the Engineering Research                   Center at Ohio State and private industries) deals with                         microstructure formation in inhomogeneous crosslinking                          polymerizations.  The third (supported by the State of Ohio                     Thomas Edison Program and private industries) deals with                        diffusion-controlled polymerizations in reactive processing.  The               fourth (which is currently being supported internally by Ohio                   State) deals with the formation of bioploymers and bioparticles                 in fermentation.  The fifth (supported by private industries)                   deals with various drug delivery systems.  The behavior of these                systems strongly depends on molecular weight, particle size and                 particle shape in the submicron range.  QELS measurements would                 provide this information accurately and efficiently, leading to                 more fundamental analyses of the underlying phenomena.                                                                                                          The QELS apparatus allows the measurement of micellar size and                  shape and, therefore, the development of criteria of micelle size               and shape needed for effective drag reduction along with criteria               for surfactant chemical structures and solvent environments which               provide these micellar structures.  This will permit the                        selection of new, useful, drag reducing surfactant additives for                both low temperature (40-55 degrees Fahrenheit) district cooling                and high temperature (80 degrees Celsius and above) district                    heating systems.  These systems conserve energy, reduce                         investment in small inefficient heating or cooling units, reduce                pollution and reduce peak electricity loads on hot summer days.                 Microstructural materials, advanced polymers, composites, etc.,                 are reshaping our society and are contributing to an improved                   standard of living.  Understanding how microstructures are formed               in materials and learning how to control the processes involved                 in their formation will make important contributions to materials               design and manufacturing.  Unsaturated polyester resins have                    shown remarkable growth in the automotive, housing, marine and                  electric/electronics industries and are the most widely used                    thermosets.  The technology developed in this study could also be               applied to other microstructures materials.",
