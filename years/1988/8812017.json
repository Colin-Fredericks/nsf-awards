 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastrin are members of a family of                    neural-gastrointestinal peptides.  CCK is one of the most                       abundant vertebrate brain peptides.  The function(s) of CCK in                  nervous tissue is unknown.  This proposal outlines studies of a                 CCK/gastrin homologue in the invertebrate, Drosophila.  Genomic                 and cDNA clones have been isolated which contain two tandem DNA                 sequences, each with strong homology to CCK.  Chromosomal                       localization maps the gene to the third chromosome.  Preliminary                in situ tissue localization indicates the presence of the                       transcript in the adult Drosophila head.  The immediate goals of                the proposal include:  1) complete genomic and cDNA sequence                    analyses, 2) isolation of naturally-occurring peptides and                      subsequent structural characterization, 3) identification of                    specific cells that express the gene by in situ hybridization, 4)               generation of antibodies to synthetic peptides whose structures                 have been deduced from the DNA sequences and 5) construction of                 an anatomical map for the peptides by immunohistochemistry.  DNA                sequence analysis will provide information on possible control                  elements within the gene.  Isolation of the naturally-occurring                 peptides will confirm processing sites, identify structure and                  demonstrate peptide existence.  Structural data will be used to                 design synthetic peptides for future physiological studies.                     Localization data will suggest a function.  This will provide                   information on regulation, processing and sites of action in                    Drosophila neural and gastrointestinal tissue.",
