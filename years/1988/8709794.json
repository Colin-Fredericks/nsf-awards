 "awd_abstract_narration": "To enhance our understanding of dispute transformation and the civil            litigation system more generally, systematic study of civil jury                verdicts is needed.  Much criticism of the civil justice system is              based on presumptions about the nature and causes of patterns of jury           verdicts, especially the sizes of awards in particular types of cases           such as medical malpractice cases and products liability cases.  By             devising and evaluating, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, a           multivariate ecological model using data from 48 counties in ll states          for the early 1980s, Drs. Andrews and Daniels' empirical study develops         an explanation of patterns of actual outcomes in medical malpractice            jury cases through the aggregate analysis of awards.  Their                     contribution to understanding what decisions are made by juries and why         is important beyond the numbers of jury cases because jury verdicts are         very influential in determining the outcomes of the majority of civil           lawsuits handled through more informal processes.",
