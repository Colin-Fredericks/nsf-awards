 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general objective of this project is to understand the                 functional organization of energy-transducing membranes.  The                   subject of the immediate investigation is the photosynthetic                    membrane, and in particular the proteins of the reaction center                 designated photosystem I.  At the heart of energy transduction in               this reaction center are two large proteins coded for by                        chloroplast genes.  It is currently believed that these large                   membrane proteins are comprised of membrane-traversing                          hydrophobic alpha-helical amino acid sequences connected by                     hydrophilic portions that protrude from one or the other side of                the surface of the membrane.  The first question to be addressed                experimentally is:  How are the two large PSI reaction center                   proteins disposed in thylakoid membranes?  This is to be                        approached by using small synthetic polypeptides corresponding to               amino acid sequences in predicted hydrophilic regions of the                    protein, to generate peptide-specific antibodies.  Electron                     microscope immunocytochemistry and other methods will be used to                determine the topology of the proteins in the membrane.                              This information is to be used as a basis for other                        experimental approaches to study the relationships of these                     proteins to other photosynthetic membrane proteins, and to                      advance the understanding of energy transduction and electron                   transport in membranes.",
