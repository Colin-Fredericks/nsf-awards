 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since the time of Plato, it has been observed that joining groups               leads individuals to think and act more poorly, often in                        destructive ways.  By the 20th century, such prominent social                   scientists as LeBon (1893), McDougall (1920), and Freud (1922)                  debated the causes of why decent persons behave badly when banded               together.  During the past two decades, research has increasingly               focused on between group interactions.  It has shown that                       interacting groups consistently act in more competitive ways than               do interacting individuals, even when cooperation would be more                 productive.  This phenomenon has been shown even in the most                    minimal social situations, when temporary groups have been formed               for dealing with inconsequential matters.                                                                                                                       The present research will test whether the primary reason that                  interacting groups behave destructively toward one another is                   that the presence of an \"outgroup\" raises negative expectations                 about exploitation and thus produces lack of trust.  To explore                 these questions, experiments will systematically lower threat and               reasons for mistrust; for example, alternatives that assure non-                exploitation and the maintenance of own-group power will be                     explored.  It is expected that such manipulations will decrease                 the frequency of destructive behavior.  If this occurs, the                     research has important implications for understanding cross-group               hostility and rejection of outgroups, both within and between                   cultures.",
