 "awd_abstract_narration": "Within the last year, a Campus Research Network (CRN) has been                put in place within the University of Hawaii System.  The network               currently connects computers in the Department of Information and               Computer Sciences, the Department of Chemistry, the Department of               Mathematics, the Department of Physics, the Institute for                       Astronomy, the Hawaii Institute for Geophysics and the University               of Hawaii Computing Center.  The network is organized as a                      collection of subnets connected together through a common                       Ethernet backbone.  The CRN is based on the DARPA/DOD protocols                 suite although there are provisions to also handle some DECNET                  traffic through parts of the network.  The intent is to develop                 the CRN into a full scale research network that is accessible to                all researchers within the State of Hawaii.                                       The University of Hawaii proposes to connect the CRN to the                   NSFnet through a satellite based link between the University of                 Hawaii Manoa Campus and the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC)               where the West Coast portion of the NSFnet backbone terminates.                 This link is intended to replace the current link into SDSC.  A                 replacement is needed since the link that now exists was designed               primarily as a terminal concentrator providing access to SDSC                   only and not as a network connection for the University of                      Hawaii.",
