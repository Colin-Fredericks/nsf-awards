 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coral reefs represent one of the world's most diverse                      ecosystem types in terms of species and also one of the most                    highly productive.  As the waters surrounding most coral reefs                  are oligotrophic (i.e., extremely depauperate in nutrients),                    planktonic assemblages of animals and photosynthesizers are                     very dilute and do not provide much in the way of food for                      coral reef organisms.  Most of the high productivity of reefs                   is based ultimately on the photosynthesis of seaweeds and                       algal-containing corals.  Thus factors that affect seaweed                      primary production contribute greatly to the entire                             organization and functioning of coral reef exosystems.                               Dr. Carpenter and collaborator Dr. Susan Williams, of the                  University of Washington, want to look at possible mechanisms                   by which this high reef production is maintained in such                        nutrient poor environs. They hypothesize that the high numbers                  of reef herbivores are able to rapidly recycle nutrients bach                   to the seaweeds, and that nitgrogen fixation may be an                          important, in situ nutrient-producing process.                                       Both Drs. Carpenter and Williams are productive young                      researchers very familiar with the ecology of coral reefs in                    the Caribbean.  Dr. Carpenter's background in reef herbivores                   and algal productivity will balance nicley with Dr. William's                   considerable nutrients dynamics experience.  Support for this                   two-year investigation is recommended.",
