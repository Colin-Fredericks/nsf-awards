 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Young Scholars Project at Long Island University revolves around a         course - Techniques in Molecular Biology - which is designed to expose          high school students (11th and 12th graders) to the methodology used in         Molecular Biology.  The summer commuter class will emphasize student            participation in basis experiments in Molecular Biology including               isolation of chromosomal and plasmid DNA, enzymatic modification of             DNA, screening of recombinant DNA clones, electrophoresis,                      microcomputer assisted analysis of data and electron microscopy of DNA.         Laboratory experiments will be supplemented with lectures and                   discussions about the methodology employed, alternate techniques, data          analysis, and application of the techniques to other disciplines.  The          course will also include discussions of the ethical aspects of research         in Molecular Biology as well as career opportunities and academic               requirements for careers in Molecular Biology.  The class will visit            other research institutions to discuss career opportunities with                members of the Personnel Department.  Follow-up activities include              several after school meetings per month during the academic year to             discuss assigned research papers and lectures by faculty on their               research.",
