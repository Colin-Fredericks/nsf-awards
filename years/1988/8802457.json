 "awd_abstract_narration": "Successful solutions of problems in robotics, computer                     vision, image processing, and computer graphics are frequently                  intertwined with efficient representations of spatial data.                     Hierarchical representations of spatial data focus the work on                  the area in which the information has the greatest density.  It                 is proposed to find solutions to spatial problems that make use                 of  hierarchical data structures; hierarchical solutions to path                planning and polygon expansion will be attempted.  The concept of               neighbor-finding will be generalized, and the use of the active-                border paradigm in octree construction will be explored.  The                   surface spatial data type will be investigated.  We will examine                the question of whether spatial queries can be processed                        inteligently by the construction of an expert system interface                  that uses the representation of the spatial elements to which the               query refers.  Theoretical investigation of Delaunay                            triangulations will be continued.  We will explore the                          relationship between hierarchical solutions to geometric                        problems, and those used in computational geometry based on the                 plane-sweep method.  The feasibility of parallel solutions will                 be considered when possible.",
