 "awd_abstract_narration": "Every gene has two essential attributes.  It determines the                structure of a protein and it is regulated.  The structure of the               protein it produces determines its function - whether it is a                   structural part of the organism or whether it can serve as a                    catalyst of a metabolic reaction.  If it is a catalyst, the                     structure determines exactly what metabolic reaction it                         catalyzes.  The regulation of the gene determines how much of the               protein is produced in each cell type and how the production of                 the protein changes in response to hormonal factors.  It is                     differences in the regulatory properties of genes that allow                    complex organisms like ourselves to be composed of many cell                    types, each with a different function.  Without these differences               in regulation it would not be possible to produce diverse                       tissues, such as muscle and pancreas that have very different                   physiological functions.                                                             Current evolutionary theory suggests that changes in gene                  regulation have been extremely important in evolution,                          particularly among groups, such as primates, that have evolved                  especially rapidly.  Despite this, because of technical                         limitations, much less is understood about the evolution of gene                regulation than has been learned about the evolution of protein                 structure.  The proposal is an effort to exploit recent advances                in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of gene                        regulation to help remedy this deficiency.  The experimental                    system to be studied is a gene, called B-glucuronidase, that is                 thought to be involved in the metabolic production of pheromones,               chemical signals between animals that alter their mating and                    productive behavior.  This gene is regulated by the male sex                    hormone testosterone and provides a favorable experimental system               because the molecular details of the regulation are well                        understood.  The specific experiments are designed to determine                 more precisely the nature of the regulatory changes that are                    occurring in the evolution of this gene, and to clarify the                     nature of the underlying genetic changes that bring about this                  evolution of gene expression.  The work will be carried on among                mouse species where the regulatory properties of the gene are                   known to be evolving rapidly.",
