 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposal is to strengthen the background and                preparation of 25 to 35 high school chemistry teachers in southwest             Missouri.  The program will be carried out in two phases.  Phase I will         involve 25 secondary school teachers who are teaching high school               chemistry, but who have only a chemistry minor or less of formal                preparation.  The program will involve an intense review of basic               chemical principles, a considerable amount of time spent on problem             solving, laboratory work involving experiments suitable for use in a            high school laboratory and laboratory demonstrations performed by the           instructional staff who will concurrently be encouraging participants in        the development of their own demos.  The participants will work closely,        both during the summer workshop and during the academic year, with a            mentor who will be one of the area's strong high school chemistry               teachers.  The basic program will start with a three-week summer                workshop, followed by four Saturday workshops during the school year.                                                                                           Phase II will commence the next summer, with the selection of 25                teachers, as many as 2/3 of whom will have been participants the                previous summer.  This phase is for teachers with a deeper background           than Phase I teachers and will include more in-depth discussion of              several theoretical topics, such as organic, chemistry, biochemistry,           environmental chemistry and computer-aided instruction.  Lecture,               laboratory, problem-solving and demonstration sessions will again be            scheduled for this group of teachers.                                                                                                                           It is expected that about thirty five different teachers will be                involved in the program in one or more of the two phases. Evaluation            will be carried out by pre and post-testing the participants and their          students and by the observations of the mentor teachers and University          personnel during their classroom visits. Letters were received from the         high schools being served supporting inservice time to implement and            encourage changes in the teaching of chemistry.//",
