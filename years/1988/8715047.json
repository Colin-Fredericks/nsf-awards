 "awd_abstract_narration": "Choline acetyltranferase is the enzyme that produces the                        important neurotransmitter acetylcholine.  The nervous system                   uses this neurotransmitter for communication between neurons in                 the brain and also for signalling organs throughout the body.                   Nervous system disease, such as Parkinson's, epilepsy and                       Alzheimer's, often shows a loss of neurotransmitters and their                  associated cells.  For these reasons, the conditions that allow                 and enhance the expression of neurotransmitter.synthetic enzymes,               are important to understand; they are indicators of neuronal cell               health and may well be the reason why neurons die in some brain                 diseases.  The research outlined is designed to exploit newly                   gained information regarding choline acetyltransferase.  This                   enzyme is processed multiple times by healthy neurons, and the                  absence of such processing is corellated with nervous system                    disease states.  The proposed work will delineate the nature of                 the processing and provide the necessary information to begin                   identifying intracellular processing sites.  Antibodies to the                  enzyme's precursor will be produced so that this newly discovered               enzyme form can be identified and studied.  These reagents can be               used at the cellular level to determine the location of the                     precursor and what organelles are responsible for the processing.",
