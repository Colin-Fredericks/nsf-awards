 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lithospheric plates that compose the outer shell of the earth                   form by volcanic processes at mid-ocean ridges (spreading                       centers) where igneous material is added more or less                           symmetrically to each plate which borders on the mid-ocean                      ridge.  This growth process is accompanied by relative motion                   between the two plates on either side of the ridge crest-motion                 that can be determined from a study of amgnetic anomalies                       observed at the sea surface over the mid-ocean ridge.  Over a                   short period of geologic time ( < few million years) this                       relative motion can be described in terms of rotation about a                   point (pole) that remains fixed to each plate.  Over longer                     periods of time the motion is moe complicated and is                            accompanied by changes in the configuration of the mid-ocean                    spreading center, changes which are manifest as overlapping                     spreading centers and proagating rifts.                                         %%%                                                                                                                                                             This project investigates the details of this process for the                   Juan de Fuca Ridge, a spreading center off the Washington-                      Oregon coast.  Wilson plans to determine a revised rotation                     pole with confidence limits for motion of the Juan de Fuca                      plate with respect to the Pacific plate.  In the process he                     will make computer modesl to demonstarate the development of                    overlapping spreading centers and propagating rifts.  He will                   also attempt to determine over what interval the relative plate                 motion can be described in terms of a sample rotation.",
