 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program is in the area of bioinorganic chemistry. The                 focus of the project is nonbiological metal-containing                          compounds which mimick the action of monooxygenase enzymes.                     These enzymes, which catalyze the incorporation of oxygen atoms                 from dioxygen into organic substrates, contain metal ions at                    their active sites, principally heme iron, non-heme iron and                    copper. The mechanisms of the reactions of these enzymes are                    not understood, and it has not been possible thus far to                        duplicate their reactivities with nonbiological reagents. In an                 effort to develop \"reaction analogies\" to the monooxygenase                     enzymes, reactions of metalloporphyrin peroxo complexes are                     being studied to learn more about the role of the O-O bond                      cleavage step in the heme enzymes. To mimick the action of                      non-heme enzymes, where much less is known about the                            environment of the metal at the active site, metal-mediated                     oxygen atom transfer from the single oxygen atom donor                          iodosylbenzene to organic substrates is under investigation.                    Also under study are iron-mediated oxygenation reactions using                  reagents containing intact O-O bonds, i.e. dioxygen, superoxide                 and peroxide.                                                                                                                                                   The results of this research will provide information useful in                 assessing mechanisms of dioxygen activation in biological                       systems and in designing catalysts for oxygenation reactions                    for use in the laboratory and in industrial applications.",
