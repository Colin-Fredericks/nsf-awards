 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to upgrade the department's Isotope            Ratio Mass Spectrometer (IRMS) because this instrument has become a             central instructional tool in several advanced courses and is now               essential for the independent study/research participation programs             mentored by three faculty members.  The instrument allows students to           study ecological, physiological and biochemical phenomena with a modern         approach utilizing natural abundances of the stable isotopes of carbon          (13C) and nitrogen (15N) as quantitative tracers.  The upgrade                  automates sample analyses and facilitates throughput by students, adds          a third detector to facilitate isotopic corrections, allows nitrogen            analyses to be undertaken readily, and utilizes a computer-controlled           analytical system which transmits data to a departmental network for            reduction, statistical analyses, and presentation.  The instrument is           being supported by an IRMS technician who facilitates student training          and use.  The upgrade is significant because it extends the instrument          into the hands of more students in advanced courses and enhances                student-mentor opportunities.                                                                                                                                        The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
