 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project are organometallic compounds in which                 the metals cobalt, rhodium or iridium are bound to macrocyclic                  ligands, i.e. organic molecules which provide several donor                     atoms for binding the metal and whose structures contain                        several rings. Such compounds show considerable promise for use                 in the reductive coupling of carbon monoxide, a process in                      which carbon monoxide is converted to more complicated and                      useful organic molecules.                                                                                                                                       A series of organometallic reactions that achieve measurable                    equilibria will be used in deriving thermodynamic parameters                    for subsequent use in estimating M-H and M-C bond energies.                     Variation of the reaction environment by solvent effects,                       zeolite encapsulation and addition of Lewis acids and bases                     will be exploited as a means of altering reaction                               thermodynamics and kinetics in order to promote new                             organometallic reactivity. Rhodium and iridium porphyrin                        species have an extraordinary breadth of organometallic                         reactivity, which encompasses the areas of C-H bond activation,                 alkene coordination and oxidation, formation of                                 heterobimetallic complexes, reductive coupling of carbon                        monoxide, and the formation of species with carbene, formyl or                  hydroxymethyl species bound to the metal. A major effort will                   be made to discover non-porphyrinic macrocycles and chelate                     ligand systems which emulate metalloporphyrin reactivity, but                   which have improved reaction rate characteristics.",
