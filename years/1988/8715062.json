The conference organizers are Dr. Haynes Miller, Massachusetts                  Institute of Technology, and Dr. Jean-Michel Lemaire, University of             Nice.                                                                                                                                                           Three topics will be stressed, each currently very active and each              of special interest to both French and U.S. topologists:  (1)                   Algebraic homotopy theory; (2) Maps between classifying spaces; (3)             Modular forms in algebraic topology.  The last topic is currently a             major area of interaction between topology and other disciplines                (mathematical physics and number theory).  Significant                          collaboration has already been initiated between U.S. and French                workers in each of these three areas, and it is hoped that this                 conference will promote and consolidate these efforts.  Publication             of proceedings is anticipated.",
