 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. White will examine collections of Upper Paleolithic objects                 housed in museums in Europe and Russia.  In particular, he will                 focus on stone, bone and ivory beads and pendants which served as               body ornaments.  Objects will be drawn and photographed, and                    their form and method of manufacture described.  Many of these                  materials are undescribed, and this is the first time that such                 ornaments will be treated as a discrete set of data and analyzed                as such.  With this information, it will be possible to examine                 the question of ethnic differentiation across this wide                         geographical area and determine the extent to which discrete                    cultural boundaries, which characterize all modern groups,                      existed at this early date.                                                                                                                                     What makes these collections important is that they are                         associated with the earliest anatomically modern humans to appear               in Europe and the first to engage in artistic practices.  Today,                art is a universal trait, a hallmark of modern human societies.                 Extremely little is known about early Upper Paleolithic cultural                practices and social organization, and this project will add                    significantly to our limited store of information.                                                                                                              This research is important because it will increase our                         understanding of the origins of human culture.  It is also                      valuable because it will make use of an underutilized resource.                 The materials from many of these sites have never been properly                 analyzed and published.  Today these valuable data, often                       obtained at great cost, are ignored.  Through Dr. White's work,                 the potential of these materials will be realized.",
