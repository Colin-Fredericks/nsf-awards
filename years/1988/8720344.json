 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental goal of much ongoing research in Appalachian                 tectonics  is to determine the history of terrane accretion in the              central and eastern parts of the orogen.  The recent discovery of               Acado-Baltic trilobites in the Carolina slate belt in central South             Carolina clearly indicates that this part of the Piedmont is an exotic          terrane that was accreted to North America subsequent to the Middle             Cambrian.  Recent studies have indicated major differences in                   stratigraphy, paleomagnetism, and tectonothermal history between the            Ablemarle area in south-central North Carolina and the Columbia area in         central South Carolina, suggesting the presence of an important terrane         boundary between Ablemarle and Columbia.  The purpose of this project           is to accurately locate and determine the nature of the boundary                between the North  and South Carolina sequences.  This will be                  accomplished by a program of geologic mapping, map compilation, and             petrological studies in the area between the two well studied                   sequences.  This study should substantially improve our knowledge of            the history of terrane accretion in the southern Appalachians as well           as facilitate the correlation of exotic terranes in the circum-Atlantic         region.  This study will provide a model for subsequent studies in              other older orogenic belts.",
