 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general aim of this one day symposium is to provide an                   overview of our current understanding of the cellular and                       molecular basis of pattern formation, a field which has advanced                rapidly during the last five years.  Pattern formation is here                  broadly defined to include maternal determination, induction of                 organ districts, and the differentiation of tissue patterns                     within these districts.  The specific aims of the symposium are:                (1) to bring together a group of investigators who use a broad                  spectrum of organisms and technologies in the investigation of                  pattern formation; (2) to determine what common and/or different                cellular and molecular themes are emerging from their studies,                  and how these themes might relate to formal models of pattern                   formation that have been proposed; and (3) to discuss new ideas                 that indicate the most significant directions the field will                    likely take. An additional aim is to reach a broad audience                     consisting not only of investigators who work in the field, but                 also those in related fields, as well as postdoctoral and                       graduate students.                                                              %%%                                                                                 One of the fundamental questions in developmental biology is                how the complex patterns of form found in living organisms                      arise. Recently molecular genetic and biochemical techniques have               been brought to bear on this question in a variety of organisms.                The purposes of this symposium are to asses the progress and                    suggest the directions of future research in this area.",
