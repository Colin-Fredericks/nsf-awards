 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this research in low- and middle-level                    computer vision is to develop new algorithms for the acquisition                of 3-D sensory data for robotic-vision systems.  The work will                  investigate:                                                                         -- new passive vision techniques for obtaining surface                     orientation and curvature information about surfaces in the 3-D                 world; candidate techniques include: polarization-based stereo,                 color stereo, direct photometric curvature calculation, and                     shape-from-specularity                                                               -- improvements in both the accuracy and efficiency of                     stereo-matching and surface-reconstruction techniques from depth                and orientation information.  These improvements will result from               a theoretically unified treatment of matching, surface                          reconstruction, and surface segmentation.                                            The work will include theoretical analysis and experimental                verification.  It differs from previous research in that the new                algorithms are to be derived from the general theories of stereo                processes, which are to be finalized as part of this research.                  The new algorithms will either use different types of information               (e.g., images under varied source polarization) or treat standard               information under more-realistic assumptions (e.g., that the                    disparity surfaces should be smooth, but not necessarily constant               or planar).",
