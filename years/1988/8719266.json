 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of separation science.  The thrust                of this experimental program is to measure the dynamics of                      sorption-desorption at liquid-solid interfaces in order to assess               the role of such dynamics in the behavior and performance of                    liquid chromatographic separation media and related chemical                    systems.  Measurement of these dynamic processes by relaxation                  kinetic techniques will provide information concerning the                      mechanisms of sorption and separation, the viscosity of the                     interfacial domain, and a quantitative measure of the degree of                 heterogeneity of surfaces with respect to the energetics of                     sorption.  Chemically modified silicas and related model systems                will be synthesized for use in these studies.  These materials                  will be fully characterized by Fourier transform infrared                       spectrometry, solid state nuclear magnetic resonance                            spectrometry, and elemental analysis.  The role of the solvent in               determining the interfacial polarity and viscosity will be                      determined using fluorescence probe techniques.  Results of these               studies will be correlated with the performance of these                        chemically modified silicas as liquid chromatographic stationary                phases.                                                                                                                                                         This research is expected to yield an improved understanding of                 the chemistry of separation processes and the general nature of                 solid-liquid interfacial sorptive systems.  This work should lead               to the development of improved chromatographic systems for both                 analytical and preparative scale applications that have broad                   impact in science and technology.",
