 "awd_abstract_narration": "A multidiscipinary project is in progress to determine the                 factors controlling forest vegetation over the last 400 years at                Itasca State Park, northwest Minnesota.  The approach is to                     reconstruct from independent lines of evidence forests, including               patterns of composition, recruitment, growth, and mortality, and                physical environments, including climate and fire, in a detailed                fashion across a one km2 study area.  Patterns within stands will               be agglomerated to document both local stand and landscape                      patterns through the past.  Methods include analysis of fossil                  pollen, charcoal, loss-on-ignition, and thin-sections  of                       laminated lake sediments, fire-scars of 400 year old red pine                   trees, stand age structures, tree growth via ring widths, soils,                light regimes, and modes of regeneration and mortality.  Results                will demonstrate many of the important influences of changing                   physical environments on vegetation that can be used for forest                 management and prediction of responses to changing climate, land-               use, and fire regimes.",
