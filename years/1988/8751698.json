Twenty-five teachers will be given         the educational experiences in three-week summer workshops in each of           two summers and an academic year one-week workshop at Mansfield                 University to act as resource persons for other teachers.                                                                                                       PI Arnold George and Co-PI Robert Johnson have previously completed an          outstanding 150 page book of activities Chemistry for Children and an           accompanying in-service guide (TEI 85-50036) which will be further              disseminated through this project.",
