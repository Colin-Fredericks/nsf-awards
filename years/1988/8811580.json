 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project deals with sensor-based robotics and mobile               platforms with as much flexibility built into the design of these               systems as possible.  The project involves three major areas:  a                dynamically balanced platform, a redundant manipulator (robot arm),             and a general purpose end effector (robot hand).                                The base will be balanced on four independent legs each of these will           be equipped with sensors to measure leg position, force exerted at              each joint, and slipping relative to the ground.  The platform will             have position sensors to ensure that it remains reasonably level and            balanced (including manipulator shifts).  The robot arm will have               eight degrees of freedom and have the ability to extend at the base             and at the upper arm.  The intent is to make the end effector as                general as possible, however, imitating the human hand is excessively           complex.  As a minimum, the robot hand will have two opposable fingers          which allows for manipulation of many objects and is easier to control          than a five-fingered device.  The hand must include a variety of                sensors to measure applied force, slip, and object deformation.",
