 "awd_abstract_narration": "In plants, specific branch pathways diverge from the central                    phenylpropanoid pathway which leads to the synthesis of                         lignins, UV-absorbing flavonoids, as well as isoflavonoid and                   coumarin antibiotics.  Environmental stresses such as UV                        light and pathogens induce the selective synthesis of                           protective compounds by particular branches.  While                             coordinate changes in gene regulation in the central pathway                    have been demonstrated to underlie these physiological                          responses, the mechanisms controlling differential activation                   of branch pathways is unknown.                                                                                                                                  As a model for understanding the coordinate and selective                       controls regulating synthesis within these pathways, this                       research focuses on the comparative regulation of genes                         encoding enzymes in the central and branch pathways for                         synthesis of flavonoids and isoflavonoid antibiotics.                           Chalcone isomerase, a possible regulatory enzyme, will be                       studied as a representative of the central pathway.                                                                                                             The research will identify the DNA sequences regulating the                     expression of the chalcone isomerase and branch pathway P-450                   genes.  This will be accomplished by:  identifying branch                       pathway P-450 genes and characterizing their expression in                      response to environmental inducers as well as during                            development; mapping the transcription units on genomic                         clones; localizing regulatory regions by construction of                        chimeric genes; and sequencing the functionally important                       regions.%%%                                                                                                                                                     It is expected that this research will reveal distinct                          promoter elements responsive to particular environmental or                     developmental signals.  This study of the organization of                       these elements in the phenylpropanoid pathway genes may lead                    to a general model for differential regulation of                               metabolically related genes in plants.  Furthermore, a                          fundamental understanding of the genetic regulation of                          phytoalexin biosynthesis is essential if this trait is to be                    genetically manipulated to enhance disease resistance in                        plants.***//",
