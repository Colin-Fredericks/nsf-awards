 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Morrison and Cedar Mountain Formations in the Colorado                 Plateau are key units in understanding Late Jurassic and Early                  Cretaceous tectonism in western North America.  In addition, these              units contain a rich fossil record of Mesozoic dinosaurs from                   numerous quarry sites in several states.  The ages and time-                    correlation of these formations are, however, still poorly                      understood.  This creates problems in understanding regional                    tectonics and in determining the evolutionary trends of the                     dinosaurs.  A threefold approach is proposed to resolve these                   problems:  1) develop better techniques for regional correlation                using volcanic ashes (which are quite common in many stratigraphic              sections worldwide); 2) obtain new isotopic ages to resolve the                 problems of time and correlation of the dinosaur-bearing strata;                and 3) use the correlated ashes and ages to determine the                       relationships between sedimentation, subsidence, and tectonics for              this period of time in the western United States.                                    Samples will be collected of ash beds for dating from                      sections both along and across the basin in which these sediments               were deposited.  Fission track 40/39 Ar laser probe techniques on               single grains will be employed to avoid detrital contamination and              obtain realistic ages.  Attempts will be made to correlate ash                  layers from one section to another by examining zircon                          morphologies, inclusions, and uranium distributions within the                  zircons, as well as by examining the trace element chemistry of                 the ashes, mineralogy of the ashes, and any other distinguishing                feature we can find for each ash layer.  Three of the sections to               be studied are located near dinosaur quarries so that the ages                  obtained can be used to resolve long-standing controversies about               the age of the fossils and the relationships with other sections                in western North America.",
