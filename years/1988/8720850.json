 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research program is to investigate methods to improve          the performance of high frequency semiconductor devices.  This will be          achieved through work in three closely related areas.  These are:               studies of the physics of high frequency electron transport in                  semiconductor devices; modeling and optimization of specific devices            and device circuits; and investigations of fabrication technology.              The specific devices to be investigated are those related to high               frequency receiver applications.  These devices are among the smallest          semiconductor devices yet developed and are capable of operating well           above 1 THz.  Specific research will investigate: high frequency                effects, the effect of fabrication technology on device                         characteristics, the use of a heterjunction to develop a high electron          mobility diode structure, and the utilization of numerical modeling             techniques to optimize diode parameters for mixer, varactor, varistor,          and sideband generator applications at frequencies above 1 THz.  The            results of this research will be applicable to future development of            other high frequency devices and circuits, such as high frequency               transistors and eventually millimeter wavelength integrated circuits.",
