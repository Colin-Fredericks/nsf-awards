 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Arizona State Young Scholars project is designed to give                   approximately thirty selected high ability and high potential secondary         school students an unusual learning experience in engineering.  An              annual summer residential course will focus on participant skill                development in logic, creativity, analysis, and communication.  A               series of state-of-the-art drawing laboratories will offer students             experience in creative expression through freehand, and computer-aided          drawing. Participants will also practive artifact design and analysis           in computer analysis laboratories using electronic spreadsheets.                Interesting design problems will be assigned, both for seminar                  discussion and investigation.                                                                                                                                   Lectures, workshops and seminars will examine pertinent topics such as          the role of mathematics and science in engineering, the philosophy,             professional responsibilities and ethics of engineering, modern                 challenges facing engineers, and the connection between engineering and         the \"liberal arts\".  Field trips will show students selected                    engineering research and manufacturing establishments, including the            Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.  Staffing levels for         the course will allow substantive one-on-one interaction between staff          and students.  Project staff will represent a cross-section of the              engineering community, will be required to have a record of skillful            teaching, successful interaction with young persons, and provide                potential mentors for the student participants.  Follow-up activities           will maintain contact with the scholars, and the impact of the program          on their career choice will be determined.",
