 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to provide research support to Dr. Manousiouthakis under          the National Science Foundation's Presidential Young Investigator               Awards (PYIA) Program.  The objectives of the PYIA Program are to               provide support to the Nation's most outstanding and promising young            science and engineering faculty.  The awards are intended to improve            the capability of U.S. academic institutions to respond to the demand           for highly-qualified science and engineering personnel for academic             and industrial research and teaching.  Dr. Manousiouthakis' field of            research is control of industrial processes.                                                                                                                    Many industrial processes are operated in a dynamic mode, exhibit               nonlinear dynamic behavior, are inadequately modeled and may have many          process variables that cannot be measured.  The central theme of the            PI's research is the development of a conceptual framework for the              design of linear and nonlinear control systems that account for the             above characteristics.  Important components of the overall task are            the selection of process models, measurements, manipulations, control           structures and control-dictated process modifications, the unification          of control schemes, the design of linear and nonlinear controllers              that maintain stability and performance and account for uncertainty             and safety and finally the verification of the proposed control                 policies.  The PI is planning to experimentally verify his theoretical          results for dry-etching reactors, reverse-osmosis modules and                   distillation columns.",
