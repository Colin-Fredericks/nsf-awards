 "awd_abstract_narration": "Estimates of public sector union wage differentials are typically               smaller than estimates of private sector union wage                             differentials.  This study investigates the extent to which this                reflects the differences in legal environments which govern                     bargaining in each sector.  Public sector unions in many states                 must bargain with fewer legal rights than their private sector                  counterparts.  In the extreme, public sector bargaining is                      prohibited by law.  The estimation procedure takes into account                 the possible endogeneity of the bargaining law variables in a way               which differs from previous studies.  Random effects models are                 estimated and Hausman tests carried out to test for correlation                 between the state-specific error component and the independent                  variables.  Preliminary analysis on data taken from the l977 May                Current Population Survey indicates that the legal environment is               not a key factor in explaining the small public sector union wage               differentials.",
