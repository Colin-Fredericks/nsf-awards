 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field of behavioral genetics has demonstrated that heredity                 influences differences among people for many aspects of behavior,               including cognitive abilities, personality, and psychopathology.                However, little is known about the extent to which genetic                      factors influence behavioral interactions for pairs of                          individuals.  From the perspective of child development, some of                the most important interactions are those within the family, yet                essentially nothing is known about such family relationships from               the perspective of behavioral genetics.                                                                                                                         Since 1985, NSF has supported research to study family                          relationships as part of the longitudinal Colorado Adoption                     Project (CAP). A unique aspect of the CAP families is that one-                 half consist of genetically-unrelated adoptive relationships                    (that is, adoptive mothers and their adopted children and                       adoptive siblings) and the other half of the families are non-                  doptive families.  By comparing relationships in adoptive and                   non-adoptive families, it is possible to begin to understand the                role of genetic factors in the development of family                            relationships.                                                                                                                                                  In early childhood, when the younger sibling was between three                  and five years of age, visits were made to the home of 150 CAP                  families in order to videotape mother-child, child-sibling, and                 mother-child-sibling interactions, as well as to conduct                        interviews and unstructured observations.  The current research                 will study the same families three years later in middle                        childhood, after the younger sibling has begun school.  This                    longitudinal extension of the study will make it possible for the               first time to explore the genetics of family relationships during               the important developmental transition from early childhood to                  middle childhood.  This study is embedded within the longitudinal               CAP which collects extensive information on the CAP children and                their home environment from infancy to adolescence.  Thus, it                   will be possible to study antecedents and consequences of family                relationships, and to consider the role of heredity in these                    associations.",
