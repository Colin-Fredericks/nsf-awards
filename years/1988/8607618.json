 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will describe the emergence of computer science            as an academic discipline.  The PI, after investigation of ten or               so academic departments of computer science, will describe the                  major factors important in the different institutional histories                of these departments.  Factors such as extramural funding                       patterns, the strength of existing disciplinary departments, the                various roles played by organized research units, etc., will be                 investigated in order to explain the present institutional                      structure of academic computer science in U.S. universities.                            The project will provide basic data, both quantitative and              qualitative, on the emergence of a field of scientific research                 for use in future S&EI reports.  The work itself will serve as a                model of how to describe a rapidly-changing, interdisciplinary                  field as it establishes itself on the nation's campuses.",
