 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of interfacial structure and                      dynamics.  The goal of this research is to develop an                           understanding of the dynamics of lateral charge and mass transport              processes in monolayer and bilayer assemblies.  Drawing upon                    pioneering advances made during the tenure of NSF grant                         CHE-8504368, Professor Majda and his students will pursue four                  related research thrusts:  In the first, they will explore the                  dynamics of translational diffusion in bilayer assemblies as a                  function of the structure of the individual constituent                         amphiphiles; second, they will determine the kinetics of electron               transfer reactions taking place laterally in organized monolayer                assemblies; third, they will characterize the reactivity of                     amphiphilic porphyrin molecules in monolayers as a viable approach              to the electrocatalytic reduction of oxygen to water; and fourth,               they will explore the applicability of organized monolayer                      assemblies to the control of the selectivity of electrode                       reactions.  These research thrusts take advantage of this group's               recently developed abilities to design and control the structure                of monomolecular assemblies and to probe the behavior of these                  systems with novel electrochemical methods.  Also, fluorescence                 spectroscopic methods, Langmuir-Blodgett techniques,                            epifluorescence microscopy, and contact angle measurements will be              applied in these experimental efforts.                                                                                                                          This research will contribute to an enhanced understanding of the               behavior of molecules in organized monolayer and bilayer                        assemblies such as biological membrane systems.  Additionally,                  these studies should give rise to new insights into the design of               efficient and selective electrocatalytic systems.",
