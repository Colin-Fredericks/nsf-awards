 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the development of advanced cementitious                 materials. The opportunity for substantial improvement of the                   properties of cement and cement-based composites has been given a               major boost by recent research in densified cement matrix materials,            'MDF' cement, and slag and silica-fume cements.  Taken together with            the rapid increase in our understanding of the theory of brittle                matrix composites, this new control of phase chemistry and processing           offers very substantial hope of new-order of magnitude increases in             properties.  Applications for such substantially improved cement                matrix materials extend from special durable concretes to specialized           materials such as machine tool and molding materials, to substrates             of low dielectric constant, or varistors.  This project includes                these major components:                                                         o   Enhancement of the matrix by manipulation of its phase                               composition                                                            o        Introduction of novel preparation and processing approaches                     to making cement-based composites                                      o        The study of totally unexplored self transformation-                       toughened cements                                                           o        Detailed characterization and properties investigations of                 the above materials.  Later stage studies will include                          regions of particulate nanocomposites and fiber reinforced                       materials.",
