 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sporoplasts prepared from mature ungerminated pollen of                         Lilium longiflorum Thunb. will be used to prepare a                             suspension of subcellular pollen particles which can be                         fractionated by gradient density centrifugation to yield                        \"storage bodies\", organelles bearing phytin-rich inclusions.                    These organelles will be studied for their phytase content,                     notably pH 5 and pH 8 phytases, which have already been                         isolated and partially purified from whole pollen.  Each                        phytase activity will be purified to homogeniety and studied                    with regard to substrate requirements, products formed,                         localization, and possible functions.  The question of                          phytate formation from 1L-myo-inositol-1-P will be examined                     to determine whether 1L-myo-inositol-1-P synthase or myo-                       inositol kinase is responsible from the first step of                           phosphorylation.  This will be done by measuring hydrogen                       isotope exchange at C5 of D-glucose-6-P during its conversion                   to 1L-myo-inositol-1-P, a procedure used successfully in                        previous studies of the path of carbon from D-glucose-6-P to                    UDP-D-glucoronate and cell wall products of glucoronate                         metabolism.                                                                                                                                                     The significance of this research is explaining the role of                     phosphate in regulating plant metabolism.  Phytate is a                         phosphorus storage compound of crucial importance yet                           practically nothing is known of how it is made by the plant.                    Phosphates play important regulatory roles in carbohydrate                      metabolism which in turn determines plant productivity.***//",
