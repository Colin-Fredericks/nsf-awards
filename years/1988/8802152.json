 "awd_abstract_narration": "The specific goals of this proposal are:  1)  To achieve,                  using newly developed immunocytochemical techniques, a detailed                 picture of both nuclear and cytoskeletal organizations present in               Drosophila embryos during the cleavage stages of development.  2)               To critically analyze the exact details of how the cytoskeletal                 elements tubulin and actin reorganize as the cleavage nuclei                    enter the periphery.  These results will be augmented with real-                time observations of living embryos viewed with Nomarski DIC                    optics and documented with video technology.  These results, in                 conjunction with the previous work will provide the descriptive                 foundations for which many known Drosophila mutations affecting                 early development can be analyzed.  3)  To examine in greater                   detail the effects mutations in the engrailed and even-skipped                  genes have on early development.  Mutations in these two genes                  are lethal to the embryo, and disrupt segmentation in a                         reproducible and spatially specific manner.  This proposal is                   designed to further our understanding of the relationship between               these genes and cytoskeletal elements in the embryo that provide                structure and movement, with special emphasis on the actin and                  tubulin-based cytoskeletons.  In the long term, an understanding                of how these and other genes act to build the body plan of                      Drosophila should tell us how similar genes work in higher                      eukaryotes including humans.                                                    %%%                                                                                 Fertilization of an egg by the sperm initiates a                            developmental program that results in a fully viable adult                      animal.  This developmental program is completely specified by                  the contents of the fertilized egg, and the challenge facing                    developmental biologists is to decipher exactly how the                         information that is present in the egg is first stored, and then                subsequently utilized and processed as the embryo develops. Dr.                 Karr's work will provide key information about the very earliest                events following fertilization.",
