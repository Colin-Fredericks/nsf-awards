 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term objective of this project is to define the                    relationship between the events of embryonic development and regulated          gene expression in the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus.  The          specific goals are to characterize the molecular details of the                 regulation of expression of particular actin genes which are                    differentially expressed in development.  Analysis of transcription in          isolated nuclei has indicated that the expression of two cytoskeletal           actin genes and the single muscle actin gene is transcriptionally               regulated in embryos.   Dr. Crain will determine whether the expression         of these three actin genes is correctly regulated in interspecific              hybrid embryos.  The temporal expression of these genes will be assayed         by protection of gene and species specific riboprobes from RNase                digestion and the spatial expression will be determined by in situ              hybridization analysis.  Interspecific hybrid embryos of the sea urchin         species A. purpuratus and Lytechinus pictus will be constructed in both         directions to assess the effect of maternal trans-acting factors on             expression of these genes.  Mapping of the position of transcription            initiation for the muscle actin gene  will be done.  This information           will allow the use of this gene to ask what sequences are important for         the muscle specific expression and to ask whether and RNA polymerase            III/SINE, which is located within the first intron, plays a role in             regulating its expression.                                                          Understanding the differential regulation of genes during                   embryogenesis is basic to an understanding of development at a molecular        level.  Dr. Crain is using a well established model system, the                 developing sea urchin, to study this question.",
