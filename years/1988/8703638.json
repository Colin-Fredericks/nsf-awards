 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will focus on elucidation the mechanisms of agglomerate           dispersion in controlled flow fields.  Mixing of solid additives into           a liquid generally involves rupture and distribution ofthe separated            particles throughout the liquid.  In order to elucidate the rate                determining step in dispersive mixing, the principal investigator will          develop and analyze models predicting the dynamics of the agglomerate           size distribution in controlled flow fields.  Each model will                   concentrate on a particular step of the mixing process and theoretical          predictions will be compared with experimental data.                                                                                                            The results of this investigation will advance the understanding of             the mechanism of dispersion of solids into liquids and will provide             insight into the design of actual mixing equipment. Many materials of           industrial significance are mixtures of solid additives into liquids.           Examples of such materials include dispersion of pigments of inks, as           well as most plastics and rubber products.  The quality of the                  dispersion strongly affects the physico-mechanical properties of the            final product.  This brings about the need for understanding and                control of the dispersion process.",
