 "awd_abstract_narration": "The World of Chemistry Secondary School Project (WCSS) is a distinctive         cost-effective education package for use as supplementary materials for         secondary schools, based upon materials developed for the college level         course which was principally funded by the Annenberg/CPB project.  The          materials will include a set of 20 modules on chemistry, which can be           used for basic to honors level first chemistry courses.  Each module            will comprise a 15 minute video tape with accompanying written materials        of a maximum of five pages per module.  The written materials will be           published as a loose leaf Instructional Manual to provide for easy              duplication.  Each video module will illustrate and highlight a given           concept or idea in a multi-faceted way: at the molecular level with two         and three dimensional graphics and state-of-the-art animation; at the           macro level through laboratory demonstrations and suggested in-class            activities for students; at the very broad macro level through                  industrial applications and practical problem solving by scientists and         engineers; and at another macro level through relating concepts to              everyday life, such as bio-medical applications, food preparation, and          the environment.                                                                                                                                                HIgh school chemistry courses have long been in need of revisions and           revitalization.  In addition, many schools have severely curtailed              laboratory experiments due to financial and liability issues.  These            materials will address both problems by providing excellent                     supplementary and current information in the area of chemistry.  Where          laboratory activities are minimal to nonexistent, the portrayal of              experiments and practical applications will help fill a serious gap.            The developmental process is being modeled on a proven process used by          the successful project, Adaptations of the Mechanical Universe and              Beyond.",
