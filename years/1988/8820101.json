 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technological advances in many fields are increasingly                     dependent on high-speed image generation and interpretation.  This              need is being recognized in the funding priorities of industry and              government.  The higher funding priority opens the possibility                  that a regional Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on              High-Speed Image/Signal Processing may be feasible and viable.                       This project is funding an Industry Planning Meeting to study              the feasibility and viability of a regional Industry/University                 Cooperative Research Center on High-Speed Image/Signal Processing               to be operated by the University of California, Irvine, University              of California, Santa Barbara and the University of Southern                     California.  The universities have drafted a prospectus of the                  Center's research and operations that will provide a basis for                  study at the planning meeting to occur in October, 1988.                             The Co-Principal Investigators and their colleagues are                    recognized experts in their fields and have the necessary                       industrial interactions to run this meeting.                                         This project was coordinated with Drs. J. Lehman (MIP) and                 Y.T. Chien (IRI).                                                                    The Program Manager recommends the University of California,               Irvine be awarded $8,990 for one (1) year for this planning                     meeting.",
