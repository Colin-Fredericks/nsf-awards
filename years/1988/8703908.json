 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cure composition, kinetics, mechanism, molecular mobility, and                  mechanical properties of several cross-linked polymers will be                  characterized by using molecular sensors in the form of a                       reactive diamine-type dye to mimic the reactivities of an                       aromatic diamine in epoxy, polyimide and polyurea.  The changes                 produced in the UV-VIS spectra and fluorescence behavior by these               dyes will provide information on cure compposition and kinetics.                In polyimides it will be possible for the first time to                         distinguish amic acid-imide from di-imide; the kinetics of                      imidization can thus be obtained with greater detail than is                    currently possible by any other spectroscopic technique.  We also               propose to synthesize new sensors to be applied to the above                    systems in order to further improve spectal separation.  Then,                  photoisomerization of the labels and the probe molecule will be                 studied to characterize molecular mobility and free volume during               cure.  Mechanical and physical properties of crosslinked polymers               will be measured as a function of cure composition, extent of                   reaction, or chain end concentration, in order to establish                     composition-structure-property correlations.  The basic                         scientific information obtainable from this research will enable                this molecular sensor technique to be utilized for \"in-process\"                 cure monitoring of high performance composite materials via                     fiber-optic techiques.  This is a grant under the Materials                     Processing Initiative.",
