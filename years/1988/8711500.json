 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding volcanic processes in the ocean basins is                 critical to several major research areas in the geosciences. Most               active volcanism occurs at mid-ocean ridges where mantle material               upwells and melts as a result of the separation of crustal                      plates. Away from these plate boundaries seamounts and oceanic                  islands can form, though the processes which form magmas in this                environment are poorly understood. The present project will                     examine seismic data from a recently formed seamount, Loihi, to                 the southeast of the Hawaiian Island chain. Current models for                  the origin of this volcanically active feature indicate that it                 is, or will be, a new volcanic island or seamount along the                     Hawaiian ridge. Hawaiian volcanoes are apparently produced by                   magma from the mantle as the Pacific Plate drifts over a fixed                  magma source.                                                                           Overall objectives of the project are to identify the                   source and depth of earthquakes in Loihi and to relate these to                 models of the volcanic evolution of such seamounts. Additionally,               the project will provide constraints to allow better location of                future earthquakes from land stations on the Hawaiian Islands.                  Data for the project were collected on a university sponsored                   research cruise.",
