 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goals of the project are to build upon the excellent                   previous work that has taken place at the Exploratorium which                   utilizes the resources of a museum to offer enriching                           experiences to practicing teachers and develops models of                       inservice programs. The plan in the proposed project is to                      work with 600 teachers at the middle school and high school                     levels from all of the school districts in the greater San                      Francisco area. It is planned to emphasize exploratory                          activities in physical science(70%) and mathematics(30%) by                     offering the teachers an immersion into subject-oriented                        activities which they in turn can adapt as possible                             experiences for their students. The model which is under                        development consists of three basic stages. The first                           establishes small group workshops which revolve around a                        curriculum suggested by the rich environment of the                             Exploratorium exhibits. The second phase enables the teachers                   to learn to use the Exploratorium as a resource center to                       enrich their learning and provide a source of information and                   potential activities for their students as well as a central                    location to share their ideas with their colleagues. The third                  phase in the model develops a support mechanism for the                         teachers as they develop projects and activities. The summer                    institute involves 100 teachers in groups of 12 to 14 working                   80 hours over a four week period to focus activities on                         learning extensions of subject matter content using the                         exhibits. The academic year follow-up takes place during 6                      Saturday morning sessions of 4 hours each and involves 40 to                    65 teachers per session. The focus during these sessions is on                  the topics chosen by the teachers relating to potential topics                  to be covered in the school program. There are to be special                    projects according to the particular interests and needs of                     the teachers. For these projects ther teachers have available                   to them the expert staff of the Exploratorium as well as the                    facilities and materials that are resident there. The after                     school and Saturday workshops occur at 12 meetings during the                   year for four hours each. It is planned to arrange these in                     two blocks of six weeks each during which there is a sharing                    of topics among the participants which encourages team                          teaching when possible. The non-NSF cost sharing is                             approximately eighty-five percent of the funded amount.",
