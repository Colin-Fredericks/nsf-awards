 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Dr. Huseyin Abut, San Diego State                        University, to collaborate with Dr. Oguz Manas, Aegean University,              Izmir, Turkey.  They will study applications of vector and matrix               quantization to image coding, image classification, image                       enhancement, and recognition problems in digital signal processing.             They will also establish a signal processing graduate course and a              laboratory in Izmir.                                                                                                                                            The researchers' goals are to extend linear prediction theory to                include low-rate image coding and image classification problems.                They will reformulate autoregressive analysis and windowing                     techniques to cover multidimensional signals.  They propose to use              information from the multidimensional signal studies to do image                coding below 0.5 bits per pixel, and to apply vector and matrix                 linear prediction concepts to image classification and segmentation             problems on which there has been relatively little research.  The               tools of digital signal processing developed in this research have              applications in studying speech, seismic activity, imaging and                  machine vision, and in designing aids for the handicapped.  This                award will help the researchers continue their collaboration on                 image classification and recognition using vector linear prediction             coefficients.",
