 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with the seismic design of arch bridges which                nonlinearly even in the elastic range under earthquake loading.  To             develop an earthquake-resistant design method the groundwork - laid             by prior research - the formulation of a geometrically and materially           nonlinear curved beam element, a nonlinear dynamic analysis                     procedure, a computer code, and a preliminary behavioral study of               several representative steel arch bridges is used.  This project,               representing a culmination of the research efforts, aims to produce             seismic design rules and tools for steel arch bridges.                                                                                                          Design rules and other practical tools are developed for both linear            and nonlinear situations.  A user's manual for the computer program             developed will be prepared and made available for general use such              as in the design-analysis iteration of an arch bridge of unusual size           or configuration.  The research would positively impact bridge design           practice.",
