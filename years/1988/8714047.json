 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. Harley Johansen and a graduate student from             the University of Idaho to collaborate with Dr. Arvo Naukkarinen of             Oulu University, Finland, in a comparative study of community                   development in Finland and the U.S.  The objective of their research            is to understand better the process of business growth in rural                 communities and how various development strategies can enhance this             process.  Rural community development in Finland and the United                 States has similar goals, but in each country development is pursued            by significantly different strategies.  This collaborative research             will examine how Finland's centralized program of regional planning             policy has worked to stimulate economic development of rural                    communities, and how this kind of external assistance and funding               compares with the predominantly local development efforts found in              American small towns.  Research will involve data collection in                 Finland to replicate a study conducted in the U.S. among a national             sample of 100 small towns that were surveyed in 1981 and 1986.                                                                                                  Economic development in rural locations is an important goal among              most countries today.  A variety of strategies for economic growth              in peripheral regions has evolved along with a greater understanding            of the complexity of development problems.  This research will                  provide insights into how the process of mobilization and promotion             of growth in small towns works, how external help can create growth             in less developed areas which do not have local resources for                   development, and whether external funding and assistance can create             preconditions for sustained growth.",
