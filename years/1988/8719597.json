 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will develop theory for food webs that                    pertains to the terrestrial communities on small islands in the                 eastern Caribbean.  A prominent feature to the animal component                 of the communities on these islands are the Anolis lizards.                     These animals largely replace the ground-feeding insectivorous                  birds so familiar in the woods of North America.  As a result,                  the abundance of anoles in natural habitat is typically 1/4 to 1                lizard per m2, making them conspicuous even to a casual observer,               and inviting the suspicion that they play a large role in                       community dynamics.  Previous research focussed on these lizards,               primarily with respect to learning how lizard species interact                  with one another, and to learning how these interactions in turn                affect the evolution and biogeography of lizards.  The new                      research will reach out from the level of the lizards within the                food web to the species above and below them.                                           It is proposed to analyze models for food webs that take                account of scale differences, in space and time, that are natural               to the different levels in a web.  It is also proposed to                       continue the census of the Anolis lizard populations on St.                     Maarten into a second decade, in anticipation of proposing new                  experimental field studies as the theoretical research nears                    completion.",
