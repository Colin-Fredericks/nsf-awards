 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Urban League (NUL) will form a Preschool Science                   Collaborative with Educational Equity Concepts, the Boston Children's           Museum, American Association for the Advancement of Science and                 Association of Science Technology Centers to develop, field test,               produce and disseminate physical science activities for preschool               children and to provide training for parents and teachers of this age           group.                                                                                                                                                          Materials that will be produced by the Collaborative include a center-          based science activities manual, activities booklet for use by                  parents and play spaces or corners for science explorations.  A                 promotional videotape will be developed to highlight various parts of           the training for parents and teachers and to promote the use of                 materials in all preschool centers.  The materials will be field tested         in twelve Urban League affliates representing a broad cross section of          participants.                                                                                                                                                   The preschool program is a component of NUL's Education Initiative which        is interested in improving science education for preschool children from        low income or single family households.  It will receive the benefits of        all the support resources that are available through NUL.  The                  directors, staff and subcontractors are highly qualified to conduct this        project.                                                                                                                                                        With the increasing number of children involved in early education, the         project should be extremely valuable in increasing our understanding of         what is happening to young children in preschools, particularly,                minority children.  This proposal clearly addresses the need for science        literacy among teachers, staff and parents of preschool children and            will refine, document and test a curriculum which consists of science           eduction activities.  The program will help to build skills of both             teachers and parents, working cooperatively, to stimulate critical              thinking in young children.                                                                                                                                     The project's goals are consistent with those of the Instructional              materials Development Program.",
