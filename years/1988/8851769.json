 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project goal is to upgrade the quality of the undergraduate            physiology laboratory by purchasing four 4-channel datagraph recorders          which have the capacity to measure many of the important physiological          parameters that are emphasized in the physiology courses.  Previously           only some of these phenomena were included in laboratory exercises due          to equipment limitations.  The scope of the laboratory portion of the           physiology courses (which have served approximately 340 women students          in the past five years) is being greatly enhanced.                                                                                                                   The data graphs are being used, for example, to demonstrate blood          pressure regulation, cardiac alterations in response to varying                 stimuli, and variations observable on the electrocardiogram when the            subject is at rest or exercising.  Previously there was no true                 exercise component to the lab experiments, not even in the areas of             cardiovascular or respiratory physiology.  The addition of these                instruments to the laboratory permits the development of two important          new exercises.                                                                                                                                                       The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
