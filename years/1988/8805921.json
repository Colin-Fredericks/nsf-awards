 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to investigate questions of uniqueness,                    stability, consistency, asymptotic behavior and analytic and                    numerical inversion of operators that arise in mathematical                     models of several inverse problems.  While the research is                      motivated by reconstruction problems in medical radiology, the                  operators under study (Radon transforms, x-ray transforms and                   generalization) are of importance in numerous other applications.                    The main topics for investigation are: the further                         development and testing of a computationally efficient cone beam                reconstruction algorithm with sources on a circle; the study of                 stability effects of data truncation in the algorithm and the                   cone beam reconstruction problem in general, and a singular value               analysis of operators arising in this problems; a group theoretic               study of filtered backprojection inversion and approximate                      inversion formulas in, and applications of wavelet theory to,                   integral geometric inverse problems.                                                 Successful completion of the project should lead to a                      computationally efficient algorithm for cone beam reconstruction,               a mathematical understanding of the stability of the algorithm                  and the inherent stability or instability of the problem.  Other                benefits include a theoretical understanding of the underpinnings               of filtered backprojection inversion formulas and the structure                 of operators arising in integral geometric inverse problems.",
