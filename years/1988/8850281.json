 "awd_abstract_narration": "The College of Arts and Sciences, Oklahoma State University, will               implement a three week Young Scholars Program.  The program is designed         for thirty-six high achieving, high-potential students, grades 9-12.            Those who attend will better understand the ways that scientists think          and work, will recognize the many opportunities for them in science,            and will experience the excitement of interacting with scholar-mentors          and other outstanding students in an enriched academic environment.                                                                                             All students will attend morning presentations, workshops, and tours.           The schedule is arranged so that the first week of morning sessions             deals with information and research, focusing on statistics and                 mathematics for the scientist.  The second week will be devoted to the          social implications of scientific study and advancement -- specifically         ethical issues.  The last week of morning sessions will cover career            options, from a variety of perspectives -- discussions with counselors          and advisors, completing a career evaluation examination, hearing               educators and professionals describe their work, and exploring the              sites where scientists go about their jobs.                                                                                                                     In the afternoons, the students will learn to use the laboratory safely         and effectively to complete assignments under the close direction of            university faculty.  In groups of twelve they will work for one week in         the field of chemistry, life sciences, and physics -- rotating each             week so that every student visits all laboratories.  The academic work          in the afternoon sessions will be rigorous, informative, and                    productive.",
