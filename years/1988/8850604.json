 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Denver Audubon Society will, over a three year period, provide the          training and materials necessary to disseminate their Urban Education           Project to six or more cities across the country.  Their outdoor                education program is \"hands-on,\" locally supported with funds and               volunteers, and targeted to include inner-city children who will be             served in locales close to their homes and schools.                                                                                                             NSF funding will support project staff, provide initial curriculum              materials, and insure close contact with the developing programs.  About        20,000 elementary children and nearly a thousand adult volunteer leaders        will participate in the program over the three year period.  At the end         of the project, the new programs will continue without further                  assistance, and will serve as models for other community programs.              Over the three year project period, more than $380,000 in local funds           and in-kind support will be provided, nearly equalling the NSF support.                                                                                         Participating cities include:  Boston, MA; Louisville, KY;  Birmingham,         AL;  Prescott, AZ; Arlington, TX;  Gainesville, FL;  Seattle, WA;  and          Broward County, FL.",
