 "awd_abstract_narration": "A conference to stimulate science and mathematics faculty at outstanding        liberal arts colleges to become actively involved in the scientific             preparation of teachers by redesigning science and mathematics courses          will be planned and convened by the Consortium for Excellence in Teacher        Education (CETE) and Middlebury College, the home institution of the            director of CETE.  Membership in CETE is comprised of the following             institutions: Brandeis University, Brown University, Connecticut                College, Dartsmouth College, Harvard University, Middlebury College,            Mount Holyoke College, Princeton University, Smith College, Swarthmore          College, University of Pennsylvania, Vassar College, Wellesley College,         Wesleyan University and Yale University.  The conference will seek to           produce collaboration among scientists, mathematicians, and educators in        modernizing course content, incorporating recent educational research           results, and in the case of science courses, providing hands-on                 experiences at CETE and 31 other liberal arts institutions located in           the eastern half of the United States.  Participants will also examine          other components of teacher preparation programs and define the role            that liberal arts institutions have in preparing mathematics and science        teachers.  A major report: Undergraduate Teacher Education and the              Liberal Arts: Creating Models of Excellence will be published as a              result of the conference.  The conference should result in strengthening        and deepening science and mathematics education at liberal arts                 colleges.  Cost sharing by CETE and Middlebury College is 12.6%",
