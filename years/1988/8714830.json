 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Jose A.              Zadunaisky of the New York University Medical Center, and Dr.                   Brahim Lahlou of the Faculte des Sciences, University of Nice, in               the area of ionic transport.  In particular, mechanisms and                     regulation of ionic transport by the so-called \"chloride cells\" of              fish gills will be studied.  In those species that permit it,                   changes from a fresh to a salt water environment, or vice versa,                cause the secretion by these cells of chlorine ions, which modifies             the electrical conductance of the skin of the gills to change.  The             hormonal process which regulates this secretory change, as well as              how that change facilitates adaptability, is little understood.  In             this study, skin cells from the gills of an adaptable species will              be isolated and mounted in test chambers, in which their electrical             properties can be monitored.  Hormones and other factors will be                added to the cell preparation, and the response of the cells to                 various changes in the composition of the fluid in which the cells              are immersed will be studied.                                                                                                                                   The French and American groups have a long history of fruitful                  collaboration in this field.  The results of this research may                  provide new information concerning basic processes of ion transport             and membrane permeability, and may also provide a better                        understanding of the regulation of absorption by complex epithelia              in animals in general.",
