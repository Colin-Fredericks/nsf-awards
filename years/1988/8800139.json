The meeting will cover the latest advances in the                   fields of NMR and ESR with emphasis on free radicals, iron-                     sulfur proteins, photosynthesis, metalloproteins, contractile                   systems, nucleic acids, protein-lipid interactions, enzyme                      mechanisms and NMR spectroscopy of plants and animals.  In                      addition nine proposed workshops are planned to discuss the                     latest developments in techniques and methodology of magnetic                   resonance.  Previous conferences have played an important and                   indispensable role in promoting the development and                             application of various magnetic resonance theories and                          techniques to biology during the past two decades.  Both ESR                    and NMR have led to detailed knowledge about the dynamics,                      structures and organizations of the various components of                       biological systems.***//",
