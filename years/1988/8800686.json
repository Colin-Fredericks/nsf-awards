 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fluctuations in fish recruitment can be precipitated by                 relatively small variations in mortality rates, growth rates or                 stage durations in the early life stages of fish.  The analyses                 of growth rate variability which may be more reliable than                      survey estimation of mortality rates, can provide important                     insights into the problem of fluctuating recruitment levels.                    To understand recruitment, it is essential to identify which                    variables (growth rates, temperature, nutrition) significantly                  affect larval survival, and subsequent recruitment into the                     adult population.  The use of microstructural otolith analyses,                 as well as stable isotopic composition of both otoliths and                     body tissues, will be used as indicators of past environmental                  temperatures and food conditions.  And, through the execution                   of controlled laboratory experiments, variables which may alter                 the microstructure of otoliths and the chemical composition of                  otoliths and of body tissues will be investigated. In addition,                 the rearing of larvae will provide a unique opportunity for the                 study of growth, feeding, physiology, and settlement during                     this important, but elusive phase.  The refinement and                          application of emerging methodologies of otolith analyses will                  not only further develop and advance the technology, but will                   also provide answers to applicable fisheries problems.",
