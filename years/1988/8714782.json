 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are two foci of this proposal.  First, research on fundamental            models                                                                          of distributed computing will be continued. The foundations of                  communication                                                                   protocols will be investigated using game automata, logics of knowledge         and                                                                             time, and other suitable tools.  The long range goal is to help develop         mathematical models and theories for protocols which will have the same         footing as the current accepted mathematical models and theories have           for                                                                             sequential and parallel models.  The second focus is to begin a new             research                                                                        effort into the connectionist models of computation.  There is hope,            and                                                                             even some evidence, that the new connectionist models will                      revolutionize                                                                   the way we compute.  There are a number of obvious differences between          traditional models of computation and connectionist models.  The goal           of                                                                              this research is to investigate how deep these differences are.  A              comparison                                                                      of the traditional parallel models of computation and the connectionist         models                                                                          will be used to determine if indeed the connectionist models are                an improvement over the traditional ones.",
