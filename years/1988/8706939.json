 "awd_abstract_narration": "The spotted hyena, Crocuta crocuta, is unique among mammals in                  exhibiting many behavioral differences between males and females                that are reversed from normal mammalian sex-role patterns.  Of                  particular interest is the observation that females are far more                aggressive than males, and socially dominant to them.                                                                                                           Drs. Holekamp and Frank will carry out a 3-year field study of                  behavioral development in spotted hyenas.  The objectives of the                research are to (1) document the emergence in infants, and                      maintenance in sub-adult hyenas, of behavioral differences                      between males and females, and (2) test several hypotheses                      suggesting factors promoting expression of such dimorphic                       behaviors as dispersal and dominance interactions.  The study                   animals comprise one large hyena \"clan\" in the Masai Mara                       National Reserve, Kenya.  Age, sex, kin relations, and social                   status are known for all clan members.  Data collection will                    involve radio telemetry and four behavior-sampling protocols:                   scan samples, focal-animal observations, critical-incident                      samples, and standardized behavioral tests administered at the                  study site.                                                                                                                                                     The research will generate useful information in at least three                 ways:  It will (1) provide comparative data on behavioral                       development available for no other social carnivores, (2)                       facilitate interpretation of data obtained in a concurrent study                of behavioral endocrinology and development in captive hyenas,                  and (3) permit Drs. Holekamp and Frank, in conjunction with the                 captive study, to determine whether any of the same social,                     ecological, and physiological variables known to influence                      development of sex differences in behavior in rodents and                       primates also operate in this species.",
