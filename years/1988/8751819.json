 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will involve 90 high school mathematics teachers, 30 each           year over a period of three years, with inservice opportunities to              update their knowledge of topics in discrete and continuous mathematics.        There is to be an intensive summer course in applications provided by           the project staff and enriched by visitors from diverse occupations. The        participants are to prepare papers on applications of mathematics that          they have studied and about which they will teach to their students. The        participants will prepare multiple copies of their applied lessons for          distribution to the other participants and other interested parties.            There is to be a demonstration class for participants which involves            staff from the project working with teachers in their own classrooms.           Also, there will be presentations by the participants for their peers           dealing with issues from the main topics of interest.                                                                                                           Developing out of the project will be a network of teachers who                 encourage the sharing of information about the applications of                  mathematics with other teachers in the network. One of the principle            investigators will conduct an extensive program of classroom visitations        to provide support to the participants during the school year. There            will be a hot line available from the teachers directly to the PI for           help or information dissemination. There will be videotaping of                 highlights of various presentation by project staff, scientific                 visitors, as well as the participants' presentations to be used for             further dissemination. There is the intent to establish a resource              center for offering the participants a broad range of materials on              applications of mathematics and top provide extensive references. The           participants are to be selected from among those recommended by the             school districts that have committed to the project.",
