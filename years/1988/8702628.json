 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports a U.S. scientist as a guest scholar         at the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) where he will            conduct research on the intake motion of air through the inlet port of          cylinders of internal combustion engines.  The study will cover                 techniques for solving a system of quasi-one-dimension, unsteady,               first-order partial differential equations governing the intake-fluid           motion; development and testing of algorithms for the numerical                 computation of these equations, defining the relevant boundary                  conditions in the numerical scheme and possible weighted combinations           of stable and unstable finite element schemes to reduce numerical               diffusion.                                                                                                                                                      Scope:  The P.I. has done considerable work in the area of engine               combustion analysis.  He has visited the host institute (ARAI) in 1986          where similar analytical work and experimental work on turbulence               intake flow is being carried.  The planned visit is likely to help his          research to produce a better modeling system for intake-fluid motion.           It is likely to increase future scientific-collaboration between India          and the U.S.",
