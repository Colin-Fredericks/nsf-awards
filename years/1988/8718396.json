 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate fundamental processes that are                    likely to influence the behavior of nitrogen in tropical rain                   forest streams.  Very little is known about hydrologic                          interactions between stream water and soil water or the potential               influences such interactions could have on the nitrogen cycle in                tropical ecosystems.  Preliminary data collected in montane rain                forest watersheds in Puerto Rico indicae that soil water carries                large amounts of dissolved nitrogen as ammonium into the riparian               zone.  Very little ammonium or nitrate is found in stream water,                however, suggesting that nitrogen is removed from solution before               it enters bulk stream flow.  It is important to determine whether               the nitrogen removed from solution is exported from the ecosystem               in a gaseous form by nitrification or denitrification or whether                it is recycled internally by plant uptake.                                                                                                                      It is hypothesized that in these tropical streams: 1) available                 stream-side inorganic nitrogen supports an active nitrification-                denitrification couple and that 2) this couple has a major                      influence on in-stream nitrogen chemistry.  Furthermore, it is                  hypothesized that flow paths through the stream-side zone will                  have a predictable influence on nitrogen dynamics.  To                          investigate these hypotheses work will be performed: 1) to                      established transect of observation wells on stream reaches with                differing stream-side hydraulic characteristics and measure                     initial concentrations of inorganic and organic nitrogen at these               sites; 2) test the effects of nitrogen enrichments on nitrogen                  chemistry at these sites; and 3) estimate the potential for                     nitrification and denitrification in laboratory soil and sediment               systems, then quantify specific mechanisms of nitrogen loss with                nitrogen-15 tracer techniques.  This combination of field                       measurements, field manipulations, and laboratory experiments                   will enable us to examine the relative importance and spatial                   characteristics of nitrification, denitrification, and plant                    uptake in typical tropical stream ecosystems.",
