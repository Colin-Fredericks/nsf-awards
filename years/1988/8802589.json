 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the area of analytical and surface chemistry                 and in the subfield of interfacial processes.  The thrust of this               experimental program is the testing of recently developed                       theoretical models which provide explication of the fundamental                 molecular interactions that underlie irreversible adsorption from               solution.  The adsorption of molecules from solution onto a                     surface is said to be reversible when the kinetics of the                       adsorption and desorption processes are comparable.  In systems                 where irreversible adsorption is observed, the kinetics of                      desorption are significantly slower than the kinetics of                        adsorption.  This implies that molecular-level changes take place               in the adsorbed layer subsequent to adsorption; such implication                has significant fundamental and applied importance.  Infrared and               photoexcited emission spectroscopy will be used to study both the               structures of irreversibly adsorbed layers and the kinetics of                  their formation and dissolution.  Additionally, surface                         ellipsometry will be employed for fast kinetic studies that are                 necessary to follow the surface phase change that converts                      reversible to irreversible behavior.  Studies of the effects of                 pressure and solution conditions and also of substrate composition              on adsorption behavior will be pursued to help to define the                    molecular details of these interfacial processes.                                                                                                               This important but largely unexplored phenomenon of irreversible                adsorption is important not only to an enhanced understanding of                fundamental molecular interactions at interfaces, but also to                   technologically important areas such as tertiary oil recovery,                  surface lubrication and wear, photocatalysis, and the interaction               of implantable prosthetic devices with their in vivo                            environments.",
