 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, considerable attention has been paid by economic         geographers and spatial economists to the operation of spatial markets.         Most of our understandings of spatial competition assume independent            entrepreneurs rather than franchises of larger corporations.  Study of          the behavior of multi-locational companies, which must simultaneously           develop strategies at both national and regional or local levels, can           provide new insight into some of the more significant yet neglected             aspects of spatial competition.  Such work will ultimately make                 possible the development of theory which is no longer restricted to the         analysis of space economies under conditions of perfect or near perfect         competition.  Specifically, Dr. Sheppard examines the relationships             between selected processes of macro-level corporate strategy and                micro-level behavior of the firm in the context of spatial competition          in multi-location corporations, typified by the gasoline distribution           and retailing industry.  Separating supply side issues of distribution          from demand issues of consumer behavior, he will develop mathematical           models of these relationships to provide a basis for simulation                 routines.  The simulations will in turn be used to examine realistic            situations.                                                                                                                                                          This examination of spatial price competition and market share             amongst multi-locational corporations has the potential to make major           contributions to our understanding of the spatial dynamics of economic          activities and to the development of theory in economic geography that          incorporates the institutional context of economic relations and                applies to realistic situations.  It will provide a foundation in the           field of economic geography for the capability of theoretically                 informed international comparative analysis.",
