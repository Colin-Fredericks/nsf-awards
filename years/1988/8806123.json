The                    topics to be represented include: 1) Control of Gene Expression                                                                                                 During Development, 2) Cellular and Molecular Aspects of Limb                   Development and Regeneration, 3) Neuronal and Muscle Development                                                                                                and Regeneration, and 4) Embryonic Organization and Pattern                     Formation. The primary emphasis will be on participation by                     graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and undergraduates since                                                                                               this Conference provides an ideal setting for first-time                        exposure of students to a critical audience outside their own                   laboratory.  Some of the speakers, however, will be established                 investigators in order to insure the quality of the platform                    presentations.                                                                  %%%                                                                             The purpose of the meeting is to provide a forum for exchange of                                                                                                information on all aspects of developmental biology.  The                       Regional Developmental Biology Conference constitutes an                                                                                                        important supplement to regular meeting of professional societies                                                                                               for several reasons.  Because it is smaller, less formal, and                                                                                                   less rigidly structured than a national meeting, the Regional                                                                                                   Conference provides an environment that encourages active                                                                                                       participation by graduate students and post-doctoral fellows,                                                                                                   including informal interactions with established investigators.                                                                                                 Moreover, because the conference is generally held at a                                                                                                         university facility close to the home institutions of the                                                                                                       participants, the cost does not prohibit attendance by students                                                                                                 and investigators  with limited budgets for travel.",
