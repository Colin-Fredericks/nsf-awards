 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research project is to establish \"mixing                  parameters\" that will quantify the degree of mixing that is                     introduced by a perturbation to a flow.  Mixing devices are often               used to enhance heat transfer rates.  The research approach will                be to make experimental measurements of the flow characteristics                and the degree of mixing that occurs in a channel containing                    three different arrangements of large-scale protuberances.                      Velocity measurements will indicate the magnitude of the                        secondary motions, as well as the magnitude and length scales of                the turbulent fluctuations.  The level of mixing that has                       occurred in the different flows will be quantified with both                    spatial and temporal probability distribution functions of the                  temperature field.  These experimental measurements will be used                to link two global mixing parameters to the actual mixing levels.               One of the parameters indicates the extent of convective mixing                 by gross secondary motions, and the other indicates the magnitude               of turbulent diffusion.  A successful choice of generalized                     mixing parameters could have a major impact on the field of heat                transfer since it will provide a means for comparing the                        effectiveness of various devices on mixing, and possibly provide                a predictive technique for the augmentation of heat transfer.                                                                                                   Increasing heat transfer rates is a critical problem for                        engineers designing devices that are limited in performance by                  their temperature, such as high-power computer chips and gas                    turbine engines.  Cooling flows may not be sufficient, and so                   devices that mix the flow are often used to enhance the heat                    transfer.  While mixing is known to increase heat transfer, there               is no general parameter that indicates the level of mixing in a                 flow and how that mixing augments the heat transfer rates.  In                  this fundamental study, experiments will be conducted to                        establish relevant \"mixing parameters\" based on the important                   physical mechanisms.  Experimental measurements of a simulated                  electronics cooling channel with different mixing devices will be               made to evaluate the ability of the \"mixing parameter\" to predict               mixing levels and resulting heat transfer.",
