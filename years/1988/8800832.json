 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal address a specific problem within a group of problems             of considerable interest in geotechnical engineering.  The group of             problems all relate to efforts to develop a general stress-strain-              time theory for soils, e.g., to develop a constitutive model.  Such a           model is required for solution of any problem in which the state of             stress in soil is changed and we need to estimate deformations, e.g.,           when we construct buildings, bridges, dams, etc.  The specific                  problem to be addressed by this research is the analysis of what                happens in soils around driven pile foundations as a function of                time.                                                                           Piles are long thin structural members that are driven into the                 ground and used to provide support for structures.  Driving of the              piles causes large strains in the soils in the vicinity of the piles            and results in large changes in soil properties which, vary radially            outwards from the pile.  Further, excess pressures develop in the               water filling the non-solid parts of the soil, and this water then              flows outwards in a time-dependent fashion.  As the water flows, the            soils densify and become stronger, thus causing an increase in the              load capacity of the piles.  Engineers count on this increased                  capacity when they design the foundation, but if the build up in                capacity is too slow, or the construction too fast, it is possible to           have failures in the foundations.                                               The problem is particularly severe with offshore oil production                 structures where piles may be up to ten feet in diameter and more               than 2000 feet long, and be designed to carry loads of as much as               5000 tons per pile.  No load testing has ever been economically                 possible for such large piles so the design is based on tests on                small piles augmented by theory.  This proposal is concerned                    mainly with the theoretical part of this problem.                               The theoretical part of the study involves an attempt to develop                a general model to describe the time-dependent response of the                  soil near deep foundations, to the changed conditions caused by                 the installation and subsequent loading of the foundation.  There               is also an experimental part in which the principal investigators               will perform tests with small penetrometers to simulate the                     action of a pile.  Analyses to find the soil properties that must               have existed in order to explain penetrometer performance is                    another aspect of this research.",
