 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigation covers a novel general purpose transport              model, embodied in an artificial intelligence based computer                    code, and its initial application to the solution of the                        radiation heat transfer problem critical to the analysis of                     crystal growth in a semitransparent ampoule exposed to heater                   cores with non-unity view factors.                                                      The computational methodology is based on a discrete                    particle model of transport being solved using a recursive tree,                a common tool used in the implementation of expert systems, and                 is suitable for solving a wide range of transport problems.  Use                of a recursive tree facilitates the convenient computational                    description of complex interactions and geometries common to                    contemporary transport problems.                                                        The development and availability of this modeling technique             and its embodiment in a well documented, portable and                           conveniently user extensible computer code results in advances in               radiation heat transfer and fluid mechanics problems.",
