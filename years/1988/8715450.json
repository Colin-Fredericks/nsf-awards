 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is an experimental investigation of the fundamental               dynamics of tsunamis (seismic sea waves) as they reach a shoreline, as          well as the ensuing run-up and drawdown processes. It is a                      continuation of the research initiation award CES-8503436. The goal is          to develop a better understanding of the mechanisms of destructive              tsunami effects in a coastal zone.  A unique laser-flow-visualization           laboratory facility developed under the initiation award is used for            generating and studying tsunamis formed as bores in the nearshore               region. Observations of viscous and surface-tension effects provide             insight into scale effects associated with physical models. Impulse             forces associated with the tsunami transition from a bore to the                run-up mode are being investigated through direct force measurements,           together with the laser-induced flow-visualization technique.                                                                                                   Combining these observations with available field observations, the             emphasis of the experimental research  is to guide theoretical efforts          toward a more realistic modeling of the mechanics of destructive                tsunami action in coastal areas.",
