 "awd_abstract_narration": "Limited dependent variables (LDV) models derived from economic                  theory frequently do not impose theoretically justifiable                       restrictions on correlations among the unobservables.  At                       present, however, classical estimation of LDV models with freely                correlated unobservables is generally infeasible because it                     requires the evaluation of multi-dimensional integrals.  Of                     particular interest are such problems that arise in panel LDV                   models and LDV models with measurement errors.                                                                                                                  This project develops and implements simulation methods for                     numerical integration and implementation to facilitate solution                 of the previously intractable computational problems.  This is                  achieved by developments along three directions:  First, the EM                 algorithm of Hartley (1958) is combined with simulation methods                 to overcome discontinuity problems in estimators studied.                       Second, techniques are provided to simulate directly from                       conditional densities.  These techniques are important for the                  implementation of the Method of Simulated Moments (McFadden,                    1988).  Third, new simulation estimators are devised that are                   continuous in the unknown parameter vector.                                                                                                                     These econometric methods are employed to analyze three classes                 of economic problems.  First, determinants of incidence and                     duration of external debt crises and IMF conditionality programs                in LDC's are studied using panel dynamic LDV models.  New                       solutions to the long-standing problem of \"initial values\" are                  provided by estimating the conditional distribution of the                      initial values.  Second, collective bargaining models are used to               study the occurrence of strikes.  These issues are analyzed                     econometrically by LDV models with imperfectly measured                         qualitative and continuous variables.  Finally, game-theoretic                  models of tacitly collusive behavior are tested through                         econometrically similar methods.  These working practical models                will illustrate the utility and tractability of the new methods                 employed.",
