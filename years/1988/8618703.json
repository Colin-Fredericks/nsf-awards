 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves support for the Chief Scientist of the               Salton Sea Scientific Drilling Project.  In Phase I of the                      project the research borehole, State 2-14, reached 3,219 m deep,                encountering temperatures <355oC and metal-rich brines containing               23 wt% TDS.  The drill cores obtained demonstrate a transition                  from unconsolidated sediments to greenschist facies metamorphism.               More than 40 different groups of investigators participated,                    funded by an interagency agreement (NSF, DOE, USGS).                                 The Phase II program will focus on reservoir engineering and               geochemical sampling.  A new well (Wilson 1-12) will be drilled                 approximately 1.5 km north of the State 2-14 with a target depth                of 900 to 1,800 m where temperatures of 210-305oC should be                     reached.  Rock cuttings, temperature, pressure and wireline logs                will be obtained and a short-term flow test of the first                        producible zones penetrated will permit sampling lower salinity                 fluids from the shallow reservoir.  The Wilson 1-12 will                        then be used as a disposal well for long term flow tests (up to                 30 days duration) of the deep reservoir in the State 2-14.  The                 new data and samples obtained from these two wells will conclude                the original objectives of the SSSDP.                                                The work to be performed in this project includes: (a)                     scientific input to planning and implementing sampling and                      testing of the two wells; (b) liaison with the DOE, the Science                 Experiments Committee and the interagency committee, as                         necessary; (c) obtaining, describing and curating drill cuttings                from the Wilson 1-12; (d) coordination of on-site scientific                    sampling and measurements, as necessary; (e) collection of fluid                samples for other investigators who cannot be present; and                      (f) editing the conference proceedings on the scientific results                of Phase I of the SSSDP.",
