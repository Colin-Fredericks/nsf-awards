 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to develop and demonstrate a system for in-               process characterization of a signature representing the properties             and thus the stamping and forming characteristics of copper alloy               strip.  The development will be accomplished by combined application            of three techniques (acoustic, eddy current, and X-ray diffraction)             for non-intrusive characterization of polycrystalline metal alloys.             These non-contact techniques were specifically selected for their               complimentary nature and real time capabilities.  Selection was the             result of a prior NSF grant.  Each of the techniques selected for               the combined measurements is sensitive to different sets of                     characteristics and thus will provide a sensitive system for                    measuring interdependent changes in these characteristics.  The                 three techniques will accomplish interrogation of different volumes             of the subject material due to the various depth of probing offered             by the teamed system.  An experimental approach will be employed to             develop and demonstrate the system.  Relations will be developed                relating the teamed signature to the mechanical properties and                  stamping and forming characteristics of the copper alloy strip.                      Electronic copper alloy strip was selected as the class of                 materials and the fabrication of switches and contacts as the                   forming process on which to focus.  The methodology developed by                this work for combining various measurements should have generic                value and permit application to other materials and processes.  The             combined application of the three measurement techniques is novel.                   This research should lead to in-process measurement of                     properties and fabrication characteristics of wrought metallic                  alloys which should result in significant improvement in                        productivity and quality.",
