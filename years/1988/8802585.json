 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this project is the creation of a                 framework for the planning of complex tasks (involving temporal                 and spatial hand-object relationships) in dexterous manipulation.               The hand-object interaction will be exploited to direct a goal                  oriented manipulation strategy which can produce the                            functionality required for a general purpose manipulation system.               The proposed approach provides an effective integration of the                  hand and the object.  It recognizes the independent nature of the               forces that the object`s surface may transmit, and the                          manipulator`s ability to generate those forces.  The proposed                   control architecture is based on Minsky`s Society of Mind                       paradigm.  The manipulation problem is decomposed so that                       discrete \"agents\" can plan the optimal placement of finger                      contacts on an object.  The goals of the different agents are                   rationalized at a higher level so that a coherent hand strategy                 is achieved.  Although this architecture can, in principle, be                  applied to any dexterous hand, the Utah/MIT hand has been                       specifically targeted for experimentation.",
