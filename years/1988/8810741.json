 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the rise of complexity of the modern state, it has become                  increasingly obvious that better methods of administration are                  needed.  Not only must the bureaucracy become more efficient, but               the implications of government policies must be analyzed.  In                   contrast to the practice in the United States where decisions on                policy and the use of social sciences in reaching these decisions               have been made on an ad hoc basis, several European countries                   have given the scientific study of government administration and                policy enactment a special position.  France, for example, has                  established a special academy for the study of administration.                  France's current socialist prime minister and his immediate                     conservative predecessor along with a large proportion of their                 cabinets are graduates of this academy.  In Germany, a special                  science called the \"sciences of state\"  (Staatswissenschaften)                  was established to address the administrative problems of the                   modern state.  This science has no counterpart elsewhere and                    includes aspects of economics, statistics, politics, public                     administration, public law, public finance, agriculture,                        forestry, mining, and \"technology.\"  This grouping of disciplines               originated in the 18th century as a curriculum to train state                   officials in the administration and reform of society.  Dr.                     Lindenfeld will trace what happened in the 19th century as these                disciplines became re-defined with changing political and                       economic conditions.  In order to carry out this study, he will                 analyze published sources (journals, textbooks, monographs),                    comprehensively survey listings of \"Staatswissenschaften\" in                    German university catalogs between 1820 and 1914, examine                       ministerial and university archives, and look at individual                     correspondence of leading proponents of the field.  The results                 will provide several case studies on the value of such a                        practically oriented field for the organization and operation of                a modern state and provide a valuable contrast to the American                  \"system\" of ad hoc reforms of administration.  This study will                  also contribute to our knowledge of German history where the                    issue of German attitudes towards modernization and modernity is                still debated.",
