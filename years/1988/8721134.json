 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program                  supports experimental and theoretical research by Prof. Andrew                  Streitwieser, University of California at Berkeley, aimed at                    analyzing the chemical structure and reactivity of carbanions.                  Carbanions are negatively charged fragments of organic                          molecules such as hydrocarbons and occur as transient                           intermediates during a wide variety of chemical reactions in                    the laboratory, in the body, and in industrial chemical                         processes.  Thus, the chemical reactivity of carbanions may be                  said to determine the path of many chemical changes.                                                                                                            Dr. Streitwieser's research will include measurements of                        kinetic acidities of weak carbon acids by the study of hydrogen                 isotope exchange rates, including benzene in aqueous sodium                     hydroxide and cyclic hydrocarbons with lithium and cesium                       cyclohexylamide in cyclohexylamine.  Equilibrium acidity                        studies will be continued, particularly for dianions and for                    carbanions not stable in THF.  Examples of the latter include                   pentafluorobenzene and other halogenated hydrocarbons.                          Following observations of low second pKa's for arylacetic                       acids, measurements of concentration effects will be made to                    analyze effects of aggregation of both mono- and di-salts.                      Theoretical work will focus on ab initio computations of                        electronic structures and geometries of carbanions and their                    lithium and sodium salts.  Calculations will also be used to                    estimate the transition structures of carbanion reactions, with                 particular emphasis on the previously noted systems, and on                     metallated hydrazones, oximes, and imines whose important                       stereochemical properties are not yet well understood.",
