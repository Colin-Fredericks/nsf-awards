 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although the Department of Botany is the smallest of four                       scientific departments at Field Museum, it administers the fifth                largest herbarium in the Western Hemisphere.  The botanical                     collections include 2.4 million specimens, not including                        unprocessed and unmounted material, and this number increases by                approximately 20,000 per year at present mounting rates.  During                the past five years, incoming accessions averaged over 31,000 per               year, with an average of 21,500 mounted and inserted into the                   herbarium per annum.                                                                                                                                            Since its founding, the Department of Botany has focused on the                 floras of North, Central and South America.  The early strength                 of the collections in the Neotropical area permit encyclopedic                  projects such as the Flora of Guatemala and Flora of Peru to be                 conducted there.  Today, the collections and research interests                 focus on tropical America, both in active research programs and                 acquisitions of new accessions.  The current interest held by the               biological community in tropical biodiversity makes the herbarium               at Field Museum a crucial information resource.  Collection,                    locality, ecological and taxonomic data provide critical clues                  toward the solution of global problems such as deforestation,                   disease control, and hunger.  The possible applications of                      information held within the herbarium, and the varied means                     through which it might be tapped, are only now being examined.                  More and varied uses are being found for the plant collections in               the herbarium, and the information associated with each specimen                will increase in value with time.                                                                                                                               This project provides partial support for curatorial and mounting               activities in the Department of Botany for the next three years.",
