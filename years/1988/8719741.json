 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is the initial phase in a project which seeks to                     understand the molecular aging of brian receptor proteins.  Dr.                 Duffy has chosen a receptor protein recently reported to be the                 precursor to the amyloid deposits found in aging mammalian                      brains.  Preliminary studies by others indicate that the gene is                highly conserved across species and appears to be expressed in                  many different cell types, including neurons.  In this initial                  phase, Dr. Duffy will survey a variety of cell types, including                 endothelial cells, glial, neurons and fibroblasts to see if the                 protein is expressed in sufficient quantities for biochemical                   studies.  Quantitation will be performed by isolating the protein               using modern FPLC procedures devised for membrane proteins.                     Purification of this receptor protein will be followed using                    antibodies raised to various regions of the human protein, based                on the DNA-derived sequence.  Dr. Duffy will supplement these                   antibodies by the production of monoclonal antibodies to the                    purified receptor.  While these studies to find a suitable model                system are in progress, Dr. Duffy will study the necessary                      elements of amyloid formation using a series of peptide analogues               to the 40 amino acid amyloid fragment.  The effect of different                 amino acids on the structure of amyloid will be monitored using                 EM, x-ray and NMR methodologies.",
