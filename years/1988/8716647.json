 "awd_abstract_narration": "Uridine kinase is the rate limiting enzyme in the salvage                    of pyrimidine nucleotides, and in many cells or tissues it                      may be the only means for synthesizing the nucleotides UMP                      and CMP.  Our work on the enzyme from mouse tumor cells shows                   that it is an allosterically regulated dissociating enzyme.                     The enzyme is also inducible by the action of growth factors                    or mitogens.                                                                                                                                                       We have developed methods for the complete purification of                   uridine kinase, have prepared antibody to the enzyme, have                      completed the early phases for cloning the cDNA for uridine                     kinase, and have obtained human and mouse lymphoma lines                        mutated at the uridine kinase locus.                                                                                                                               With the above we plan to systematically investigate                         structure-function properties of the enzyme by completing the                   cloning and sequencing of the cDNA.  We will prepare                            truncated cDNAs expressing shorter enzyme fragments which wil                   be measured for loss or change of function.  The mutant cell                    lines also express enzyme with smaller subunits than normal:                    these will be characterized to determine what kinetic/                          functional properties have been altered.  Also, different                       types of cells or tissues each express only one uridine                         kinase protein, but of varying size.  We will seek to                           determine if there are multiple genes, of which only one is                     expressed in a given tissue, or if a single gene product is                     subject to variable processing mechanisms.",
