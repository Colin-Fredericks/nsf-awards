 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a seminar, \"Quaternary Extinctions,\"                    organized jointly by Drs. Richard G. Klein of the University of                 Chicago, Richard Wright of the University of Sydney, Australia and              Atholl J. Anderson of the University of Otago, New Zealand.  Twelve             participants from the U.S. will join 12 scientists from Australia and           three from New Zealand between 6 and 11 August 1988 at the University           of Sydney.  The purpose of the seminar is to understand why massive             faunal extinctions occurred in both Australia and the Americas near             the end of the Pleistocene.  Participants will discuss:  (1) the                chronology of extinctions, as revealed by geomorphic or other proxy             evidence and especially by radiocarbon dating; and (2) the                      archeological, paleobiological, geochemical, and geomorphic evidence            for a coincidence between extinctions and climatic change or between            extinctions and important events in human prehistory, including the             first appearance of people in the Americas and Australia.  A wave of            bird extinctions that swept the Pacific in late prehistoric times               provides an interesting potential analog for the late Pleistocene               extinction events, and its pertinence will be addressed particularly            by New Zealand participants.                                                                                                                                    This joint U.S.-Australia-New Zealand seminar will enable the first             in-depth comparison between the American and Australian extinction              events.  To date, American and Australian/New Zealand scholars                  working on this question have, for the most part, worked in isolation           from one another.  Interregional comparisons will undoubtedly provide           new insights as to whether the extinction of large numbers of animal            species near the end of the Pleistocene resulted primarily from human           activity or from climatic change.",
