 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates knowledge base machines, that is,              computer systems which support large amounts of knowledge in                    flexible form and allow efficient retrieval and reasoning.  The                 approach taken is to apply techniques recently developed for text               retrieval systems (such as signature files and special hardware for             unification based on cellular logic) to knowledge base management               systems.  The combination of software development and hardware                  innovation through Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) is                       particularly promising.                                                               The importance of this work is that large knowledge bases are             increasingly being constructed, and it is critical to develop much              more efficient means of accessing and utilizing the knowledge in                these systems.  This award is being funded as one of the 1988                   Research Initiation Awards for outstanding new investigators in the             Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) Directorate.",
