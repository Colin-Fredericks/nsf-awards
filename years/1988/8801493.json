 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multicellular development in plants involves a long causal                  chain between genome and macroscopic phenotype.  Cell behavior is               a key intermediate stage.  One the one hand the genome provides                 the basis for the cell behavior.  On the other, the cell                        behavior, when integrated through time and space, produces the                  successive developmental stages.  Dr. Green specialize in these                 later aspects of the causal chain.  Dr. Green studies the                       development of the shoot in terms of the directional                            reinforcement, by cellulose, in the walls of growing cells.                     Cells maintain, or reorient, the direction of cellulose synthesis               at mitosis.  A biophysical theory to explain the origin and                     spacing of leaves, phyllotaxis, is being developed.  Its main                   tenet is that growth of recently formed leaves influences the                   apical dome by stretching its cells which then establish new                    reinforcement patterns on the dome.  This can explain the                       placement of subsequent leaves.  Now he proposes to test                        experimentally the apparent key relationship- between cell                      stretch and reinforcement behavior by altering organ stretch                    patterns and studying cell responses.  He also proposes to find                 out if the present theory can be extended to additional                         phyllotactic patterns and if it can be applied to the generation                of form in leaves.  Sufficiency of the biophysical explanations                 will be tested by a finite element program which correlates                     physical forces and cell responses in model meristems.  A general               biophysical theory for shoot development should result.                          %%%                                                                                Research in this project centers on the way that plants                     inherit their geometrical features. The best known examples of                  pattern in plant shoots are the spiral lines seen in the heads of               sunflowers and the helical lines made by the scales on a pine                   cone. These spiral patterns are also found in the leaf patterns                 of most plants growing in temperate zones.  Obviously, plants                   have a \"developmental engine\" that produces leaves in a pattern                 specific to the plant. The present research is concerned with the               cellular basis of the formation of these patterns. The patterns                 are generated by a cycle of activity at the stem tip. At the stem               tip, leaves or other appendages, arise at points of                             discontinuity in the reinforcements patterns around cell                        surfaces. These reinforcement patterns are a result of cellulose                microfibrils.  Once a leaf is establishes, the growth of its                    base act of the adjacent tissue, stretching it. This causes a                   response in neighboring cells which create new discontinuities.                 Thus surface irregularities lead to organs and the organs make                  irregularities. The cycle can go on to perpetuate a fixed                       pattern. This research is to expand this interpretation of all                  patterns and to examine the apparently key connection between                   physical stretch and the cell response which alters                             reinforcement direction.",
