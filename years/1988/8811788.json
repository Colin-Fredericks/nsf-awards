 "awd_abstract_narration": "The essential role of proteases in cellular control mechanisms                  warrants the identification of the proteases involved.  We                      propose to investigate processes dependent upon protease action                 in the dimorphic fungus Mucor racemosus by combining biochemical                and molecular biological techniques.  During spore, swollen                     spore, and budding yeast-to-hyphal conversions, increases in                    aminopeptidase as well as carboxypeptidase levels were observed.                Preliminary studies indicate that a 39 kilodalton protease                      (carboxypeptidase; CP2) is expressed in hyphal cells, but not in                spore or yeast cells.  We propose to isolate and study CP2 by                   using biochemical and protein chemical methods.  The elucidation                of the basic biochemistry of CP2 will provide a basis for                       developing hypotheses about its physiological functions.  In                    addition, these studies should lay the foundation which will lead               to our cloning and characterizing the CP2 gene.  These                          investigations should increase the understanding of the                         relationship of protease to biological control processes in                     general and could provide information about the control of                      morphogenesis.                                                                                                                                                  These studies, using a fungal model system, are important to our                understanding of the growth of this organism.  In the long term,                these studies have implications for our understanding of protein                synthesis and metabolism, and nutrition in many organisms.                      Protein synthesis, function and transformation is vital in all                  organisms, yet we know little about the important biochemical                   events and their regulation.  These studies are aimed at                        increasing our understanding of these important processes.",
