 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is a renewal of an earlier study of                          accretionary processes and related phenomena on the Barbados                    Ridge accretionary complex.  This work began as a joint program                 between scientists at Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory in                  the  U.S. and the University of Birmingham, in the U.K.                                 The principal objective of work under this extension is to              further explore fluid expulsion features, heat flow and pore                    water geochemistry near the tow of the Barbados accretionary                    complex, which deep ocean drilling and geothermal surveys are                   shown to be prevalent on the lower slope of the complex.  The                   objective is to quantify the flux from and define the geometry                  of pathways for fluid flow.                                                             The proposed research will be carried out on a cruise that              is already planned for University of Birmingham scientists to                   work on the R/V CONRAD.                                                         %%%                                                                                     When oceanic lithosphere is subducted, some of the                      sediment lying on top of the lithospheric plate is scraped off                  and forms the accretionary wedge complex.  Deformation of the                   accretionary wedge complex is often associated with the                         expulsion of pore fluids and sites of pore fluid expulsion have                 been shown to be locales of biological communities.  This                       project is directed towards understanding the nature of pore                    fluid chemistry and fluid pathways in a variety of environments                 on an accretionary wedge complex that is readily accessible to                  east coast scientists.",
