 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electrochemical methods are becoming increasingly important in the              studies of chemical, biomedical and environmental sciences.                     Laboratory experience is being offered in the principles and                    techniques of contemporary electroanalytical methods to chemsitry               majors and other science students enrolled in instrumental analysis             courses.  The BAS 100A electrochemical analyzer capable of performing a         wide variety of controlled potential techniques and computer data               handling is being utilized in inorganic and organic trace analyses,             kinetics and mechanism studies.  The voltammetric techniques are being          taught via an integrated electrochemistry workstation in a simple,              rational and stimulating manner.  Students who are generally more               familiar with spectrochemistry and chromatography, are also using               electrochemical techniques to equal advantage in solving analytical             problems in their independent projects and undergraduate research.  In          addition, students in an environmental chemistry course are applying            the electrochemical techniques to investigate \"speciation\" of metals            and anions in electrochemical samples.
