 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Dr. Winterer of Scripps Institution             to participate in a study of the morphology, sediment history,                  and geochemistry of guyots which are located between the Japan                  Trench and the Hawaiian Islands. This area of the Pacific Ocean                 is known to be unique and is characterized by numerous seamount                 chains, atolls and guyot groups which began forming during a                    Cretaceous period of extensive volcanism. Data to be collected                  during a field program aboard the Thomas Washington include                     reflection seismic profiles, gravity and magnetics across                       individual guyots as well as sampling of these features. These                  data will be used to examine questions on the age sequences of                  volcanism, Cretaceous Pacific Plate motions, lithosphere                        flexuring and elastic/thermal thickness, geochemical affinities                 and mantle sources of volcanics, seamount paleolatitudes,                       thickness and internal stratigraphy of guyot reef caps, and the                 timing and causes of reef drowning. These data will be used to                  examine the hypothesis that the older northwest end of this                     \"Darwin Belt\" of seamount chains was underlain in Cretaceous                    times by the type of mantle and thin, hot lithosphere that now                  underlies the active, southeast part of the belt.                                       This is a cooperative project involving scientist at                    Scripps Institution, Texas A & M University and the Massachusetts               Institute of Technology. Data from this project will be important               in planning future ocean drilling in this region.",
