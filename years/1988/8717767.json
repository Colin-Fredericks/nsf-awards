 "awd_abstract_narration": "A very important feature in the construction of organic compounds is            optimizing yields for the many steps involved.  A number of important           variables for these reactions, e.g. temperature, concentrations, rates          of mixing, etc., ideally should be evaluated for each step in the               synthesis.  This project in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry            Program is developing robotic techniques which the chemist will find            useful in maximizing yields.                                                                                                                                    The Purdue Automatic Synthesis System (PASS) is being developed as a            resource for the synthetic organic chemist.  When completed, PASS will          feature eight variable-temperature reactors, on-line quantitative               analysis by HPLC and GC, automated handling of bar-code labeled                 samples, and dual robotic arms all operating under the control of a             hierarchical computer network.  By using a menu-driven user interface,          the chemist can define the capabilities of the system and the goals of          the experiments which will be automatically executed.  Experimental             designs such as grids, screening procedures (fractional factorials,             Plackett-Burman), fitting schemes (central composite, Box-Behnken), and         self-directed methods (Simplex or Uniplex) will be available.  The              goals of this project are completion of the PASS hardware, developing           the control software, and exploring the prospects for including                 artificial intelligence into PASS.",
