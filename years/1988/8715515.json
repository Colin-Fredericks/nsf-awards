 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Professor                Roger Craig of the University of Massachusetts Medical School and               Professor Raul Padron of the Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones            Cientificas (IVIC) in Caracas, Venezuela.  The objective of this                research is to study the structural mechanism of contractile cells in           muscle and nonmuscle tissue.  These cells are able to contract by the           sliding of contractile filaments past one another without any change            in filament length.  The sliding force is generated by the cyclic               interaction of myosin crossbridges with actin filaments and is                  powered by the splitting of ATP during each crossbridge cycle.  Using           ultrarapid freezing techniques, the investigators are able to arrest            the crossbridges at transient points in the cycle and directly                  examine, via an electron microscope, intermediate crossbridge states.                                                                                           The physiological techniques and apparatus for freezing the muscles,            as well as the facilities and expertise for image processing of the             micrographs will be done at IVIC while the U.S. side will carry out             most of the freezing and the subsequent electron microscopy of the              samples.  This research should provide insights into the molecular              basis of cellular movement and a better understanding defects in                structure that occur in diseased states.",
