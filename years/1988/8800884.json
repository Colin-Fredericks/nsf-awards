 "awd_abstract_narration": "We have discovered that for most practical magnetic materials, a                combination of third-harmonic and fundamental flux can reduce the               excitation current and core losses significantly below the levels               found with the fundamental flux alone.  The third harmonic can result           naturally or can be applied.  This effect is greater under more                 saturated conditions.  Before applying this phenomenon fully to                 improve the performance of electromagnetic apparatus--primarily                 transformers and rotating machines--by either reducing losses and               improving efficiency under rated conditions or increasing the rating,           a thorough understanding of how materials will perform under the                influence of third-harmonic flux is absolutely needed.  As an                   immediate goal, a theoretical and experimental investigation in the             following form is proposed: 1) mathematical models to describe with             useful engineering accuracy how core losses and excitation current              vary with varying amounts and relative phases of fundamental and                third-harmonic flux; 2) useful mathematical circuit models for devices          (transformer and rotating machines) that accurately represent coupling          caused by core material nonlinearity between fundamental and harmonic           circuits; 3) experimental studies related to the mathematical models;           and 4) evaluation of potential improvements and their cost                      effectiveness.  This fundamental knowledge will enable further                  improvement of the performance of electrical machines and                       transformers.",
