 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flora North America is a long-term multi-investigator                   project designed to provide consistent and comparable information               about the vascular plants (ferns, conifers, and flowering plants)               of North America north of Mexico in both published and                          computerized form.  The project is a cooperative effort among                   botanists and other scientists in more than twenty institutions                 in the United States and Canada; the Missouri Botanical Garden                  serves as the organizational center for the project, with Dr.                   Nancy Morin as convening editor.  Funding of the first stage of                 work will support preparation of taxonomic synthesis for the                    estimated 600 species of ferns and conifers, with treatments                    contributed by thirty botanical specialists; support for                        postdoctoral research on the Cyperaceae (sedge) family; conduct                 of a workshop to evaluate current uses and future requirements                  for floristic data; and initial development of a national                       computer database of floristic information.                                             Taxonomic study of all plant groups will entail critical                examination of specimens as well as synthesis of the literature                 and will involve a two-tiered review, by an Editorial Board of                  leading floristics researchers and by extramural experts.                       Consequently, authoritative information on the vascular plants of               continental United States, Canada, and Greenland (estimated to                  include 17,000 species), describing and evaluating their full                   range of variation, will be available in comparable and fully                   retrievable form for the first time. The computerized database is               envisioned as an expandable, relational repository of data on                   characteristics about the plants, allowing correlation and                      analysis with geographical and other physical parameters. The                   published floras and developing computer database will benefit                  research in systematics and evolutionary biology, including                     ecology and biogeography, and will serve as practical references                in biology, wildlife and land management, horticulture,                         agriculture, and conservation biology.",
