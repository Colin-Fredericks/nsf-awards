 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is a first step toward developing a mathematical             model that will predict the distribution of permanently frozen soil             (permafrost) in areas of irregular terrain over large areas (hundreds           and thousands of square miles).  Permafrost distribution can now be             determined only by expensive and time-consuming boring and subsurface           temperature measurements in the field, processes which are especially           refractory in rugged terrain.  Professors Nelson and Outcalt are                developing a means for linking topoclimatic (near-ground-level)                 measurements of freezing and thawing degree-day sums to the occurrence          of permafrost.  If they are successful in measuring topoclimate                 accurately and in establishing the relationship, permafrost occurrence          will be deducible from easily-obtained topoclimatic measurements.  Our          understanding of the basic processes involved in permafrost formation           and occurrence will also be increased.  This first stage of their long-         term project will test their instruments and measurements under                 laboratory and field conditions.",
