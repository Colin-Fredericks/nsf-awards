 "awd_abstract_narration": "A continuation of research at (inter)national accelerator                  laboratories performing experiments in the area of intermediate                 energy physics is proposed.  Particle experiments are performed                 at the TRIUMF accelerator in Canada.  Presently underway is a                   measurement of radiative muon capture in hydrogen.  This                        measurement has never before been made due to the small                         branching ratio, a few parts in one-hundred-million.  The                       hydrogen measurement will provide a clean determination of the                  induced pseudoscalar coupling constant of the semileptonic weak                 interaction.  The nuclear RMC measurements, data taking                         completed, are now being analyzed.  They check on                               renormalization effects in nuclei.                                                   The other part of the program centers on photonuclear                      experiments with a tagged polarized gamma ray beam.  These                      experiments have been initiated at the Laser Electron Gamma Ray                 Source (LEGS) being constructed at Brookhaven National                          Laboratory.  This is a unique new facility in which every                       photon, at a rate of ten million per second is tagged and                       polarization of roughly ninety percent both linear and circular                 is expected.  The first experiments will study deuteron                         photodisintegration by detecting the recoil proton.  The second                 set of experiments will study Compton scattering and neutral                    pion photoproduction from protons and deuterons with polarized                  photons.  The recoil proton or neutron and photon will be                       detected in coincidence.  These measurements enable the                         determination of the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of                  the nucleons.",
