 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major long range goal in the study of muscle contraction is to                explain the physiological responses of muscle fibers in terms of                the kinetics and energetics of the interaction of actin and                     myosin.  The proposed work will approach this goal by measuring                 the mechanics of contraction of single permeable skeletal muscle                fibers under a variety of conditions.  These data will be used                  to refine models of the complex chemomechanics of the contractile               interaction.  Our previous work has characterized the effect of                 ligands on the shortening of fast skeletal fibers.  An extension                of this approach to slow muscle and to lengthening of fast and                  slow fibers will produce new data defining the interaction of                   MgATP and other ligands with the contractile proteins.                          Additional correlations linking muscle physiology to the                        biochemistry of the acto-S1 interaction will be determined by                   comparing the response of active fibers to the kinetics of the                  acto-S1 interacton using a series of different nucleotides                      modified at either the base or the ribose ring.  In an extension                of previous studies, using recently developed methods, studies                  originally performed at 10 degrees C will be performed at more                  physiological temperatures.  Preliminary results show that the                  response of the fibers to alterations in MgATP or pH may be quite               different at higher temperatures.  Together the data obtained in                the above studies will lead to a more detailed model of the                     energetics of the cross-bridge states involved in substrate                     binding and in product release.                                                                                                                                 The results of this research will contribute to our understanding               of the basic biochemical mechanisms underlying muscle                           contraction.",
