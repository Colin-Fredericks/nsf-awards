 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funding for the operation of a centralized               marine aquarium facility that serves as a shared, core resource                 for seven ongoing research projects at the Marine Biomedical                    Institute and other departments of the University of Texas,                     Galveston.  These laboratories are engaged in basic research in                 the neural sciences, studying aspects of anatomy,                               electrophysiology and biophysics, pharmacology, biochemistry,                   and behavior in vertebrate and invertebrate aquatic species                     collected by and/or maintained in the aquarium.  Projects                       include:  studies on the electrophysiological and pharmacological               effects of natural and synthetic egg-laying-related peptides on                 identified neurons in Aplysia, electrophysiological and                         behavioral studies to identify and characterize the neuronal                    circuits that underlie rhythmic swimming behavior in glutamate                  and dopamine on isolated horizontal cells from the retina of                    catfish, anatomical and electrophysiological studies on                         vestibular modulation of locomotion using stingrays, biochemical                and electrophysiological studies on the identification and                      actions of a novel peptide transmitter in Aplysia that influences               the processing of peptides in the atrial gland and CNS neurons                  that regulate egg laying and influence the bag cell                             neuroendocrine system, and immunocytochemical, biochemical and                  physiological studies of central neurons in Aplysia that regulate               bag cell activity.  The facility also supports projects that are                involved with electrophysiological, morphological, and                          pharmacological analyses of the neural regulation of locomotion                 in lamprey and stingray spinal chord.",
