 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will test the general hypothesis that a                      specialist frugivore (Phainopepla nitens) provides superior seed                dispersal for desert mistletoe (Phoradendron californicum) than                 does a group of generalist foragers.  The project will examine                  components of seed dispersal that can be expected to vary with                  the quality, measured in terms of costs incurred by the plant, of               the dispersal agent.  Such components of dispersal include                      proportion of seeds handled, survival of handled seeds, and                     survival of dispersed seeds.  Complexities of the dispersal                     system, including impact of host tree species, seed clumping, and               time of year on germination and seedling establishment will be                  examined experimentally.  Because each of the components can be                 measured in terms of seeds wasted for each established seedling,                researchers will quantitatively compare the cost of dispersal                   provided by a specialist with that provided by a group of                       generalists.                                                                         This study will indicate how a dispersal mutualism actually                influences plant reproduction.  While seed dispersal by either                  specialists or generalists is technically mutualism, the study                  will distinguish strong from weak interactions between the birds                and plants.  This will be accomplished by examining the combined                effects of fruit defense, seed dispersal, and seedling                          establishment for mistletoe reproduction.",
