 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Michael L. Corradini,                Department of Nuclear Engineering, University of Wisconsin to pursue            with Dr. Moohwan Kim, Mechanical Engineering Department, Pohang                 Institute of Technology (POSTECH), for a period of 24 months, a program         of cooperative research on the effect of interfacial structure on film          condensation and aerosol transport in the presence of a noncondensable          gas.  Two major test series will be conducted by the PI at the                  University of Wisconsin, (1) an air/steam-water series will be used to          characterize the effects of interfacial waves on the condensation heat          transfer coefficient and (2) a repeat of these tests with aerosols              included in the gas mixture to investigate the effect of steam                  condensation on aerosol transport under various air-steam ratios.  The          companion research effort at POSTECH will be directed toward analyzing          the experimental data and comparing the results with a condensation             model developed by the Korean collaborator.                                                                                                                     In addition to the importance of the project as a basic research study,         this research is important to an understanding of how passive                   condensation can assist in the removal of radioactive aerosols from             air/steam-water mixtures in severe nuclear reactor accidents.  This             project will add an international cooperative dimension to ongoing              research at the University of Wisconsin supported by the National               Science Foundation under Grant No. MEA8351983, a 5-year Presidential            Young Investigator (PYI) award.  This project is relevant to the                objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to         increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists            and engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas,            skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual          benefit.",
