 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Nicholas Strausfeld is an extremely gifted scientist who               has been gathering a volume of information on the organization of               the insect brain.  His previous work has focused on the                         neuroanatomy and functional organization of the brain and                       thoracic nervous system of dipterous insects, in particular the                 blowfly.  In his new research program he shall exploit a cardinal               feature of arthropod brains: namely, the presence of a manageable               number of large nerve cells with characteristic forms, which are                readily identifiable in all individuals of a species and which                  can be unambiguously related to specific motor neuron pools                     innervating identified muscles used in a specified locomotor                    function.  The ultimate goal of this new line of research is to                 resolve the functional organization of neurons that mediate                     polarized-light orientation.  To this end the project is                        restricted to the analysis of clearly defined and                               neuroanatomically identifiable sensory systems leading to                       identified motor neurons and muscles.  The physiological studies                are specifically designed to test the activities of premotor                    descending neurons in response to polarized light in the context                of other visual and mechanical cues, such as would normally be                  encountered.  The research will test current hypotheses                         concerning polarized-light-sensitive networks.  This work is                    important because it seeks to functionally detail a complete                    neuronal circuit from sensory input to muscle movement, a circuit               in which the anatomy of the neurons has already been beautifully                described.",
