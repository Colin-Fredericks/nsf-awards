 "awd_abstract_narration": "Novel methods for integrating optical interconnect elements such                as waveguides, etalons, and photorefractive media, are key                      elements to the development of new algorithms, architectures, and               compact processors for optical computing and neural network                     applications.  Proposed, for the first time, is the experimental                implementation of new GaAs-based integrated optical logic                       networks that corporate orthogonally intersecting rib waveguides                and selectively defined nonlinear aluminum gallium arsenide and                 indium gallium arsenide superlattice etalon regions.  Continuous                wave and pulsed tunable infrared dye laser techniques will be                   used to demonstrate data encoding and arithmetic logic in coupled               waveguide/etalon arrays which transmit optical data in both a                   pipelined and parallel fashion, simultaneously.  The operation of               the network is based upon the local interaction of three optical                beams, two of which propagate in the sample plane and overlap in                a region of saturable absorption, while a third control beam is                 used to set the output optical logic state.  It is shown that                   crossbar networks can be used as logic gates or passive intensity               and polarization modulators, depending upon the wavelengths and                 intensities of the data streams within the optical waveguides.                  Possible techniques for nonlinearity enhancement and the                        integration of volume storage elements will also be explored.",
