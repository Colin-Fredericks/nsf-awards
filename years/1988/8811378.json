 "awd_abstract_narration": "In preliminary experiments with Chironomus eggs, a bioassay for                 anterior determinant activity has been established.  The activity               is necessary for head and thorax formation.  It is localized                    anteriorly in the egg and is associated with a relatively small                 (250-500nt) cytoplasmic poly(A)+RNA.  More narrowly defined size                fractions containing the activity will be isolated by gel                       electrophoresis and used to prepare a size-restricted cDNA                      library.  If sense RNA transcribed in vitro from this entire                    library is active in the bioassay, the library will be subdivided               progressively until individual sequences with anterior                          determinant activity are identified.  Alternatively, the bioassay               will be combined with a hybrid-depletion procedure. The principle               of this procedure is to selectively remove certain RNA sequences                from a biologically active complex mixture of RNA molecules.                    This is accomplished by solution hybridization with cloned cDNA                 and subsequent digestion with RNase H.  These steps have been                   tested in preliminary experiments and can be carried out with                   batches of several hundred cDNA clones at a time.  If the                       depleted RNA mixture is no longer active, then the previous                     activity must have resided in one or more of the removed RNA                    sequences.  These can then be identified by progressive                         subdivision of the batch of cDNA clones used for depletion.  The                Chironomus RNA sequences identified as anterior determinants will               be compared to similar sequences in other organisms, in                         particular to known Drosophila transcripts involved in defining                 the anteroposterior polarity.                                                   %%%                                                                             It appears that the earliest information about the polarity of an               organism in laid down in the egg cytoplasm.  By the time an egg                 is fertilized, it is already determined which will be the head                  and tail end of the organism. Dr. Kalthoff is exploring how this                positional information is laid out in the egg and what molecules                contain this information.  He is using insects for the model                    system in which to carry out this investigation due to the fact                 that there are mutants available in insects which affect this                   aspect of pattern formation.",
