 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two phenomena occurring in particulate flows, namely, heat                      transfer during collisions between particles and surfaces, and                  the interaction of the particles with the momentum and thermal                  boundary layers will be studied.  Experiments will be performed                 using particle diameters between 1 to 10 mm, low and high thermal               conductivity particles, and laminar and turbulent flows.  Flow                  visualization, particle tracing, and Laser Doppler Anemometry                   will be used for the velocity measurements.  The rate of change                 of sensible heat of a collector (particle/wall interaction) and                 the change in local rate of surface heat transfer                               (particle/boundary-layer interaction) will be measured in the                   heat transfer experiments.  In addition, analytical/numerical                   study of the elastic impact will be made by allowing for variable               surface areas, heat transfer through the surrounding gas (gap                   contribution), material property differences between the particle               and the surface, particle spin, and surface roughness.  These                   studies will determine the role of particles in heat transfer                   from dilute particulate flows (such as in drying and the                        freeboard portion of the fluidized beds) and will supply the                    fundamental knowledge needed for understanding and prediction of                dense phase systems.                                                                                                                                            Many particle systems, such as dryers, fluidized beds and                       particle processing (mechanical or chemical loops) require                      transfer of heat between fluid/particle mixtures and confining or               submerged surfaces.  Two of the major heat transfer mechanisms                  are the direct transfer of heat between the particles and these                 surfaces (conduction), and direct heat between the fluid and the                surfaces.  The latter is influenced by the motion of the                        particles.  Presently, the conduction contribution is not known                 for practical cases where the particle surface is not smooth, and               when the particle undergoes a spin and arrives at the surface                   obliquely.  The extent of the disturbances caused in the flow                   field, by the motion of the particles, is also not yet known.                   This study aims at furnishing these needed fundamental data on                  the influence of particles on surface heat transfer rates.",
