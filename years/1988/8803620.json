 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project uses the fern Ceratopteris as an                                   experimental plant system that provides several advantages                      for such studies, including: a variety of confirmed mutants                     derived from the same salt sensitive wild type genotype, the                    ability to rapidly characterize the genetic basis of the                        various mutants, the ability to precisely determine                             quantitative responses to stress, and the ability to                            efficiently carry out physiological and genetic studies on                      both a simple haploid gametophyte and a developmentally                         complex vascular sporophyte phase of the life cycle.  Initial                   studies show that while the effects of single genes on                          tolerance may be modest, specific combinations exhibit                          synergistic effects, resulting in high levels of tolerance.                     The physiological and genetic complexity associated with                        natural salt tolerance is most likely based upon similar gene                   interactions.  The availability of the described mutants and                    the advantages of this plant system provide a unique                            opportunity to study fundamental aspects of salt tolerance in                   plants.                                                                         %%%                                                                             The development of crops with enhanced tolerance to salt and                    other osmotic stresses is an important objective in dealing                     with the worldwide problem of excess salinity on agricultural                   land.  However, the complex basis of salt tolerance is                          incompletely understood.  Fundamental genetic and                               physiological studies are needed.",
