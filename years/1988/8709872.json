 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ice nucleators, which initiate ice formation at temperatures above              those at which ice formation would normally occur, have become                  important  research topics in a wide range of scientific disciplines            ranging from atmospheric science to agriculture (crop damage resulting          from ice nucleating bacteria) to cryopreservation.  We have studied the         biology and biochemistry of blood proteins with ice nucleator activity          that are important components of the ability of certain insects to              survive the freezing of their body fluids.  It has been postulated that         the nucleators cause ice formation in the blood prior to ice formation          in the tissue thereby facilitating formation of a supercooled state             within the cells and a prevention of ice crystal formation in the               cells.  This project continues those studies and is particularly                concerned with blood lipoproteins produced by freeze tolerant larvae of         the cranefly Tipula trivittata.  The major research effort focuses on           what makes this lipoprotein an ice nucleator.  The lipoprotein is quite         interesting because of certain similarities in composition with the             bacterial ice nucleator which is involved in serious freeze related             damage to certain agricultural crops.  Overall, the results should              increase our understanding of the regulation of cold-hardiness and              freeze tolerance in insects.",
