 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II                        molecules are important cell recognition molecules for the immune               system.  They are characterized by a very high degree of                        polymorphism within a species.  Because the T cells of the immune               system depend upon the MHC polymorphisms for the discrimination                 of self and nonself, it is important to understand how the                      observed polymorphisms relate to the function of the MHC                        molecules.  In previous studies this laboratory has shown that                  one of the four polymorphic regions in the class II A-beta                      polypeptide specifies the epitopes recognized by antibodies.  A                 model of the three-dimensional structure of the class II molecule               has been proposed based on the recently determined x-ray crystal                structure of the HLA A2 class I molecule.  In this model the                    region that has been determined to specify the antibody epitopes                is a series of residues between two conserved alpha-helices.  The               structure of this region has not been predicted, but its position               in the molecule  suggests that it would be accessible to solvent                and thus to antibody molecules and potentially also to the T cell               receptor.  Of the other three polymorphic regions in the beta 1                 domain, two are likely to be inaccessible, while the other is                   likely to be accessible.  In the studies now proposed, the role                 of each of the polymorphic regions in determining the epitopes                  recognized by T cells will be analyzed.  The naive T cell                       responses to a panel of cell lines expressing limited and defined               alterations in the class II I-A molecule will be quantitated by                 limiting dilution analysis of responder cell frequencies.  The                  set of cell lines expressing variant I-A molecules has been                     produced by site-directed mutagenesis and DNA-mediated gene                     transfer.                                                                            These studies should indicate which of the polymorphic                     regions of the MHC class II molecule determine epitopes                         recognized by T cells.  The detailed information on the                         functional protions of the class II molecule that will be                       obtained in these studies can then be correlated with the                       details of the structure of the molecule as they become                         available.",
