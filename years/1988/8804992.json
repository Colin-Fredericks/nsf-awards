 "awd_abstract_narration": "The coupled chemical reactions that perform photosynthesis,                although not common to all organisms, are among the most crucial to the         existence of life on this planet.  Although photosynthesis has been             studied intensively for many years, detailed structural and functional          information at the molecular level about how the proteins and membranes         that make up the photosynthetic apparatus are assembled is just                 beginning to become available.  Such information should prove valuable          in understanding not only photosynthesis itself, but also the structure         of highly ordered membranes and the mechanisms of electron transfer             reactions.  This, in turn, should prove important for the future                development of biotechnology in the areas of membranes and                      electrochemistry.                                                                    This award will provide funds to a group of investigators at               Arizona State University for the purchase of an advanced picosecond             spectrophotometer, an NMR and other equipment to be used for primary            protein structure determination.  The research to be performed includes         physical, chemical and genetic studies of the photosynthetic apparatus,         including the individual steps of electron transfer that follow photon          capture.  Other related structural studies of non-photosynthetic                proteins are also planned.  These investigators are among the most              outstanding now working in the area of photosynthesis.  In addition to          this award, they have recently been selected to receive one of three            Plant Research Center awards.",
