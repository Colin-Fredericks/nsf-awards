 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Kroodsma will carry out four interrelated studies of vocal                  development and its consequences among passerine (perching)                     birds.  These four developmental studies are important for                      understanding the neural control, the evolution, and the                        functions of acoustic signals among birds.                                                                                                                      1.  In contrast to true (oscine) songbirds, flycatchers seem to                 lack the ability to imitate vocal signals.  Comparison of song                  development by (suboscine) flycatchers and by oscine songbirds is               a critical first step to understanding the consequences of                      strikingly different modes of song development and the possible                 differences in the neural control of vocal signals in these two                 suborders of passerine birds.                                                                                                                                   2.  Laboratory experiments on song development with towhees will                reveal the processes by which interacting birds develop songs                   that are either similar or dissimilar to those in their acoustic                environment.                                                                                                                                                    3.  Paruline warblers use different songs in different contexts.                Studies of their song systems will help in understanding the                    relationship between vocal development and geographic variation                 in songs, the selective forces on the structure of acoustic                     signals, the responses of males and females to these songs, and                 how warblers use this remarkably complex communication system.                                                                                                  4.  A study of wren vocal behavior will examine the possible role               of song development and cultural evolution in maintaining genetic               isolation between two song populations in an area that they both                inhabit.                                                                                                                                                        To do this research, Dr. Kroodsma relies on a combination of                    field and laboratory studies, and chooses the most suitable                     species for each set of questions.  The results should yield                    important insights into the relationship between song development               and the functions of vocal behaviors of birds.",
