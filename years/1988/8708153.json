 "awd_abstract_narration": "Surface infrared spectroscopy will be applied in this study                of gallium arsenide anodic oxidation.  The technique will be used               both for the characterization of pre-oxidized gallium arsenide,                 and for investigation of the oxide as it is being formed.  The                  surface infrared spectroscopy will be applied as an in-situ,                    multiple internal reflection geometry to directly measure the                   chemical composition and rate of growth of anodic oxides at the                 interface between gallium arsenide and the growth electrolyte.                  This will enable determination of the reaction mechanisms of the                oxide growth, the chemical kinetics of the reactions, and the                   composition of the oxide layer produced.  In addition, the                      effects of process parameters on kinetics and on composition will               be investigated to determine optimum growth conditions.                              Advantages of native oxides as insulating layers on                        semiconductors include simplicity of processing, dependable film                adhesion and system purity.  The anodic oxidation process for                   gallium arsenide has been demonstrated as very promising.                       Previous studies have shown that the process is kinetically                     controlled, however the chemical kinetics and mechanisms of the                 oxidation reactions are not yet known.  The successful                          passivation of gallium arsenide by native oxides has been a                     barrier to their full scale application in integrated electronics               and optics.",
