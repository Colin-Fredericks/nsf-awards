 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. E. Hadjimichael is an important contributor to the                     field of electromagnetic processes in nuclear physics.  He                      proposes to study photoreactions and electroreactions of                        few-nucleon systems in order to learn about the off-shell                       nature of nucleon-nucleon interaction phenomenon as they                        manifest themselves in electromagnetic and weak currents.  He                   also plans to investigate neutrino and antineutrino reactions                   with the deuteron, so as to check the sources of exchange axial                 currents and to test the standard model of electroweak                          interactions.                                                                        Major new experimental facilities are planned at CEBAF                     and BATES for studying the electromagnetic processes of nuclei                  by electron and photon scattering.  The proposed research is                    important for developing an understanding and explanation of                    the experiments which will be performed at these facilities.                    The present level of theoretical research in this area is                       sufficiently low so as to pose serious problems for the field                   given the substantial investments in new experimental                           facilities.  Relevant research in this area should be                           encouraged.",
