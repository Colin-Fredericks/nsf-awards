 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mr. Weisend proposes to review the status of cryogenic research in the          People's Republic of China (PRC), one of just three countries which             have successfully developed a cryogenic third-stage space rocket.  Mr.          Weisend hopes to visit several of China's major cryogenic                       laboratories--under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and at various              universities--and discuss their research programs with Chinese                  scientists and engineers there.  He hopes also to visit one of China's          industrial cryogenic facilities.  He would visit the sites over two             weeks, during vacation periods at Xi'an Jiaotong University, where he           will spend a post-doctoral year during 1989.                                                                                                                    Mr. Weisend's study would address three questions:                              What are the current and future areas of research in Chinese                    cryogenics?                                                                     Where is that work being done and who are the key researchers?                  Where are the results of that research published and can those results          be made accessible to the U.S. cryogenic community?                             Mr. Weisend hopes that his report will increase information exchange            between the U.S. and Chinese cryogenic communities and perhaps lead to          cooperative research.                                                           Mr. Weisend would distribute the results of his study through the               University of Wisconsin-Madison (UWM) cryogenics group's national               mailing list, which includes all major U.S. cryogenic researchers in            industry, government, and academia.  A condensed version of the report          would be submitted as an article to CRYOGENICS.  The report would also          be announced in COLD FACTS, the quarterly newsletter of the Cryogenic           Society of America.                                                             Mr. Weisend expects to receive his Ph.D. in December this year in               cryogenics from the Department of Nuclear Engineering and Engineering           Physics at UWM.",
