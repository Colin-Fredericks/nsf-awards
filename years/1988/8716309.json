 "awd_abstract_narration": "High-frequency (<0.01-10 Hz) fluctuations are prominent                 characteristics of light in shallow, marine environments.  High                 frequency fluctuations have been shown to have significant                      effects on photosynthesis and primary production by terrestrial                 plants and, more recently, by marine microalgae.  The proposed                  research will examine effects of high-frequency light                           fluctuations on the photosynthetic physiology and productivity of               the benthic macroalga, Chondrus crispus.  Plants will be                        acclimated under a variety of constant and fluctuating                          irradiance, C-assimilation, and growth rates will be compared for               the different treatments.  The mechanisms of fluctuating light                  effects will be examined by comparing light-harvesting                          characteristics, carboxylating enzyme activity, light absorption                kinetics, and pool sizes and turnover rates of metabolic                        substrates.  Results of laboratory experiments will be related to               environmental conditions by comparing responses of plants grown                 under different in situ light regimes.  Overall, the proposed                   research will provide comprehensive information about effects of                high-frequency fluctuations and response mechanisms in a marine                 alga from a light environment which is both highly variable and                 definable.",
