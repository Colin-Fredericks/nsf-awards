Collisions that change the orbital angular momentum of                 the target atom will be studied at lower energies than before,                  down to a few eV.  Measurements will investigate a recently                     confirmed strong-coupling effect in which several units h of                    angular momentum may be transferred in sufficiently slow                        encounters.  Charge transfer from Rydberg target atoms into                     Rydberg projectile states will also be investigated at lower                    energies in order to make a definitive comparison between                       ground-state hydrogen and Rydberg-state targets.  Other effects                 will be investigated that are related to slow-ion collisions:                   the behavior of highly excited states in pulsed or transient                    electric fields and the behavior near anticrossings within or                   between n manifolds.",
