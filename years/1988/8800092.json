 "awd_abstract_narration": "The outermost atmosphere of the earth consists of hydrogen,                the lightest gas, which is produced by the dissociation of water                vapor and methane in the altitudes of above 500km, where the H                  atoms travel on free ballistic orbits out to distances of as much               as 10 earth radii before returning.  Some of the H atoms have                   sufficient energy to escape the earth completely, and it is in                  this way that the primitive earth lost the large amounts of                     hydrogen to make possible the present oxygen rich atmosphere.                        The hydrogen provides a background medium through which                    energetic charges particles trapped in the earth's magnetic field               (the ring current and Van Allen belts) travel, and collisions                   with the H atoms are the main loss process for the trapped ions                 energized during magnetic storms.  The energetic neutrals                       resulting from such collisions travel on straight line                          trajectories, and can provide, with suitable detectors, \"images\"                of the ring current in an analogous way to photons entering a                   camera.  Collisions with low energy ions are an important cooling               process for the very numerous low energy ions that also populate                the near earth space threaded by the earth's magnetic field (the                Magnetosphere).  Thus it is important to know the distribution of               hydrogen around the earth (the Geocorona) to be able to model the               interactions with the ions; interpret \"images\" in energetic                     neutrals; and quantify the escape rate.  This information can be                obtained by ground based observations with Fabry Perot                          interferometers, and a number of observers and theoreticians at                 three universities (Wisconsin, Michigan, and Alaska) and the                    Aerospace Corporation have formed a group to carry out                          simultaneous measurements from sites ranging from Puerto Rico to                Spitzbergen, to determine the latitude variation, and the height                distribution of the Hydrogen.",
