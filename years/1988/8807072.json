 "awd_abstract_narration": "To ensure the vitality of the Nation's technological enterprise, it is          necessary to maintain the quality, effectiveness and distribution of            the human resource base in science and engineering in general, and in           computing technology in particular.  Toward the fulfillment of this             objective, it is crucial to increase the minority presence in the field         by stimulating computer science research and education at minority              institutions such as Atlanta University (AU).  With the development of          a viable infrastructure via the NSF-CISE Program, AU hopes to play an           important role in establishing a regional base for such activities and          promoting computer science research and education at other HBCUs.                                                                                               Through this project, AU will develop a comprehensive five-year plan            for improving the academic program, research and computing facilities           with emphasis on the following:                                                                                                                                 (1) Reorganization of research via creation of a limited number of              research clusters around the existing nuclei of research interests;             (2) Improvement of the existing academic program and curriculum                 development in advanced courses related to research areas;                      (3)  Enhancement of the existing computing facilities and creation of           special-purpose laboratories;                                                   (4)  Creation of a viable faculty base; and                                     (5) Creation of linkages and partnerships with other major                      universities, government laboratories and industry.",
