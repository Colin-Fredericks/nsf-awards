This meeting will consist                of two parts:  1) a series of \"Pre-meeting Workshops\" to be held                prior to the main meeting (June 19-21) at Kibbutzim in the                      vicinity of Jerusalem and 2) the main meeting to be held in                     Jerusalem (June 21-24).                                                                                                                                         This meeting will focus on bridging the gap between basic                       molecular and cellular approaches to the developing nervous                     system and the study of neurological disorders of known ontogenic               etiology.  It is hoped that this combination of basic                           developmental neuroscientists and researchers in more clinically                oriented fields will help to generate new approaches to the study               of normal and abnormal neural ontogeny.",
