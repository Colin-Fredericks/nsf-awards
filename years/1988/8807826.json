More specifically the goals of the research are to:                 1) identify the analytical methods that provide the best                        discrimination among soil humic samples; 2) quantify the range of               chemical and functional variation in soil humics at the local and               interregional scales; 3) determine how the variation is related                 to environmental differences in plant species composition, soil                 drainage, season, and other soil physical.chemical parameters;                  and 4) develop a quantitative model that accounts for the                       chemical behavior of humic substances in two study watersheds.                                                                                                  The two watersheds to be studied are the Big Moose/Pancake.Hall                 Creek in the Adirondacks of New York and the Camp Branch                        watershed in the Cumberland Plateau of Tennessee.  They provide                 contrasting combinations of forest cover, soil orders, and                      climate.  The hydrologic transport and major ion chemistry have                 been well studied and so the results of the humic acid study can                be integrated into a well understood biogeochemical framework.                                                                                                  State\u001a.\u001aof\u001a.\u001athe\u001a.\u001aart empirical and modeling techniques will be used           in the humic acid research.  For example, XAD\u001a.\u001a8 adsorption                    chromatography will be used to isolate hydrophobic and                          hydrophilic acids from material samples.  The ILWAS model, a                    geochemical model recently developed for acid rain research,                    will form the basis for representing ecosystem\u001a.\u001alevel behavior of              humic substances.                                                                                                                                               The significance of this research is related to the fact that                   many of the key reactions and processes affecting the                           biogeochemical behavior of elements are controlled by soil humic                substances.   For example, soluble organic acids, including                     humic and fulvic acids exert a major influence on the rates and                 stoichiometries of mineral weathering, phosphorus and                           nutrientcation availability, and leaching in surface soil                       horizons.  This research should further our understanding of                    factors controlling biogeochemical cycling in forests and provide               an enlarged scientific management basis for these systems.                                                                                                      Dr. Cronan has a very good record of productivity in research on                forest soils.  The institutional support available to him is                    adequate.",
