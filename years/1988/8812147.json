 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop parallel algorithms for the description               of problems in wave propagation.  A series of models based on the               two-dimensional wave equation will be considered.  These are:                                                                                                        i)  the simplest representation of wave motion, as described               by the acoustic wave equation                                                                                                                                       ii)  wave propagation described by the homogeneous                          formulation of the spatial displacements, and                                                                                                                      iii)  the corresponding heterogeneous formulation for spatial                displacement.                                                                                                                                                   Geometrically complex subsurface models can be investigated by                  the latter formulation.                                                                                                                                              In each case parallel algorithms based on finite difference                approximations will be implemented.  The artificial boundaries to               the physical domain can be replaced by a damping boundary layer                 or numerically absorbing boundaries.  The accuracy and efficiency               of the algorithms will be compared with their serial                            counterparts.                                                                                                                                                   Additionally, the pseudospectral method, which may be supposed to               have greater accuracy, will be implemented for each of these                    models.  Its accuracy and efficiency will be compared with the                  finite difference solutions.",
