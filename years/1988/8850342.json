 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Hands-On-Science Outreach (HOSO) program, with support from NSF, has        established more than 15 sites across the country where it operates             after school science enrichment classes taught by local community               resource staff using materials and training provided by HOSO.  With             steady growth, these outreach sites have over three years reached more          than 10,000 children with multi-session science programs.  In the 87-88         school year 681 classes at 15 sites were offered, while the parent              Hands-On-Science (HOS) program in Montgomery County, Md provided 532            classes.                                                                                                                                                        HOSO will extend the results of the first three years, establish new            sites, strengthen existing ones and develop an overall plan for economic        self-sufficiency.  Additional curriculum materials will be developed,           manufacturing and distribution methods will be improved, and experiments        with more cost-effective teacher training implemented.   Planning               options will include whether to emphasize centrally managed and operated        program sites, or to expand the model of local \"franchises\" that operate        independently, but are supported by HOSO as an initiator, developer and         supplier of materials and training.  Other project support from user            fees and private grants will total more than $ 300,000.",
