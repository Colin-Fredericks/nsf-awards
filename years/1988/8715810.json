 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knowledge of Late Quaternary environments of the desert                 southwest has expanded greatly in the past twenty years, due                    mostly to the introduction of paleobotanical studies of packrat                 middens.  Paleoecological reconstructions of the Chihuahuan                     Desert regions of western Texas have been developed by Van                      Devender (1985) for the past 40,000 years, documenting a series                 of vegetational responses to environmental changes during and                   after the Wisconsin Glaciation.  Van Devender has made a series                 of 110 insect fossil assemblages available for detailed                         investigation.                                                                          In this research, these assemblages will be used to test                hypotheses concerning modern analogs for past insect faunal                     assemblages, the relative rate of insect response to                            environmental change in comparison to that of the vegetation, and               the origins of the modern Chihuahuan Desert insect fauna.  In                   addition, the taphonomy of insect fossils in packrat middens will               be examined and modern insect habitat and distribution data will                be collected.                                                                           Experiments on live-trapped packrats will test their                    acceptance and/or preference for various large-sized beetle                     species.  The insect fossil samples cover the same time span as                 the paleobotanical record, and derive from the same midden                      samples.  This provides site-by-site and sample-by-sample                       paleobotanical data and radiocarbon chronologies for correlation                with insect fossil data.",
