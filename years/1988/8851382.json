 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Advanced Workstation Applications and Graphics Laboratory includes          a number of scientific workstations in a network with peripherals such          as printers, plotters, a video recorder and associated software.  The           system is expandable and could include as many as 40 workstations.  The         laboratory network is connected to a campus network to extend access.           The laboratory is expected to: 1) improve instruction in the sciences           through detailed visual displays of molecular structures, simulations           of complex systems, complex mathematical surfaces and functional                relationships; 2) provide students with the tools for computer                  graphics and other applications requiring complex, high-speed                   computations such as CAD, map preparation from large data bases, and            modeling of electronic andmolecular structures; 3) provide students             with state-of-the-art instruction in computer graphics; 4) prepare              high-quality, sophisticated courseware which requires high-resolution           graphics.  The grantee provides funds for this project that are an              equal match for the NSF award.",
