 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conodonts of middle Ordovician age collected by he PI as part              of a biostratigraphic project were found to have tissue preserved               in and below their basal cavities.  This 450 million year-old                   material from eastern Australia appears to be the oldest known                  fossil tissue.  The horizon with the conodonts also contains these              remains of several other groups with tissue preserved.  These                   groups include trilobites, gastropods, inarticulate and articulate              brachiopods, corals, sponges, bryozoans, and fish.  Some prelimi-               nary microscopy has been begun on the material already collected.               Discussions with members of the Institute of Molecular Biology at               the University of Oregon have led to offers of facilities                       necessary for gel electrophoresis protein analysis, residual                    protein immunological  analysis, protein sequence determination,                amino acid analysis, transmission electron ultrastructure studies,              and other techniques to obtain the most biochemical information                 from the preserved tissues.  During the first year, the work will               a) aim to determine the extent of the tissue-rich fossil horizon                in the field, b) attempt to discover the reasons for the                        exceptional preservation, c) establish the biochemical condition                of the organic remains, and d) explore the suitability of the                   various known methods for analyzing the remains.  During the                    second year this information will be applied to as many groups as               possible to gain the maximum biochemical and taxonomic knowledge                about the organisms present in the deposit, many of which belong                to major groups that are now extinct.",
