 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of chemical modification of                       surfaces.  The primary thrust of this research effort is to                     investigate in detail the chemical reactions by which the                       surfaces of silica can be chemically tailored with silanes to                   produce products and processes of broad scientific,                             technological, and industrial importance.  Among these are                      chromatographic stationary phases for the efficient separation of               products in chemical and biotechnological manufacture, and                      catalysts for the economically and energetically favorable                      synthesis and processing of materials.                                                                                                                          The research strategy will focus first on the solution chemistry                of the alkoxysilanes that are used in surface modification                      processes.  The thermodynamics and kinetics of physisorption of                 these alkoxysilanes on silica will then be studied by                           thermochemical and chromatographic techniques to elucidate the                  role of such \"pre-reaction encounters\" in the overall sueface                   modification process.  The extent to which the reactions of                     alkoxysilanes with silica surfaces can be catalyzed, either as                  solution/solid or as gas/solid reaction systems, will then be                   explored.  Finally, the results of these studies will be utilized               to develop dynamic computer models with which the silane                        modification of silica surfaces can be more fully understood and                with which optimal reaction conditions for desired surface                      modification processes can be predicted.",
