 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports participation of 12 U.S.                    scientists in an Indo-U.S. joint workshop on material                           processing, thin films and applications.  The objectives of                     the workshop are to identify fields of research of mutual                       interest in the area of material synthesis, process                             development and applications, and to plan outlines of joint                     research projects by institutes in the two countries.  Topics                   to be covered include:  Deposition technologies with emphasis                   on plasma assisted techniques; material properties for thin                     and thick films including tribological, optical,                                optoelectrical, and semiconductor properties; and current                       technological applications of candidate materials in specific                   fields, including mechanisms of failure of coatings and                         relation to material properties.                                                                                                                                Scope:  The workshop is in an area of great interest to the                     U.S. and India and where applications are being developed                       worldwide at a rapid rate.  The topics of the workshop are                      current, and the U.S. P.I is a leader in research in this                       field.  Other proposed U.S. participants are well established                   researchers who, along with the Indian counterparts, should                     ensure a successful outcome of the meeting.  A report of the                    results will be produced.",
