 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-stationary and transient transport effects are expected to play             crucial roles in determining the performance of ultra-small electronic          devices.  This is especially true for structures fabricated of III-V            compound and alloy materials.  The nature of carrier transport in such          structures demands the use of sophisticated modeling and simulation             techniques in order to describe and predict experimental observations           and device performance.  We will address these modeling challenges by           developing a moment-equation simulation tool as well as making                  enhancements in our existing Monte Carlo code.  A prime objective and           contribution of this research will be the development of an efficient           coupling technique for the two simulation approaches.  Details of the           nature of suitable and compatible boundary conditions will be                   explored.  We will also make a detailed assessment of the validity and          utility of the moment-equation approach for ultra-small device                  simulation.  Our target material systems will be In(x)Ga(1-x)As,                In(x)Al(l-x)As, and InP, chosen because of the increased technological          importance of these materials in opto-electronic communication                  systems.  In order to fully exercise these simulation tools, we will            focus our attention on a device characterized by both small geometries          and large, rapidly varying fields, the heterojunction bipolar                   transistor or HBT.  Our work will lead to an improved understanding of          HBT device physics and new device designs exhibiting higher cut-off             frequencies.  These designs will exploit the transport phenomena                studied with the new simulation tools.  The coordinated implementation          of the Monte Carlo and moment-equation tools and the assessment of the          moment-equation approach in a device content will hasten the                    development of useful and efficient simulation tools suitable for               device design.  This simulation effort will also provide the necessary          background for our future experimental investigations of carrier                transport in HBT-related structures.",
