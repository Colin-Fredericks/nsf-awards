 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will continue an ongoing analysis of                      cutaneous gas exchange in vertebrates and the means by which it                 may be regulated.  One critical question concerns how effective                 changes in blood flow can be in regulating cutaneous gas                        exchange; resolution of this question requires a precise                        distinction among the ways in which changes in bulk blood flow to               the skin might be manifested at the microcirculatory level.                     Variation in cutaneous microcirculation, (2) tube hematocrit,                   (3), capillary recruitment, (4) the spacing of recruited                        capillaries, and/or (5) spatial and temporal heterogeneity in 1-                4. These five variables will first be quantified while oxygen                   uptake is measured in an isolated perfused skin preparation; this               preparation will yield information on how experimental variation                in these five variables is related to the magnitude of cutaneous                gas exchange.  A complementary study will characterize the five                 variables in vivo to determine how they actually vary in an                     intact animal.  Another critical question concerns the resistance               of diffusion boundary layers about skin in water:  Is their                     resistance large, negligible, or somewhere in between?  A second                series of experiments will directly examine the extent to which                 oxygen diffusion boundary layers may limit cutaneous gas exchange               with animals of different flow regimes.  In an experimental                     preparation, the absolute and relative resistances of the skin                  and the oxygen diffusion boundary layer will be quantified.                     These issues are important ones because, although skin is one of                the primary gas exchangers of vertebrates, our knowledge of                     cutaneous gas exchange is as yet too sketchy to achieve a general               and comprehensive understanding of vertebrate gas exchange.",
