 "awd_abstract_narration": "This developmental psychology project studies the perceptual,              cognitive and social behavior of infants and children using a variety           of techniques.  The methods include naturalistic observation,                   correlation, and experimentation.  Behavior is recorded on video tape,          observations are coded and entered into a computer for analysis.                                                                                                     The award upgrades the existing developmental psychology                   laboratory with a video camcorder, a remote control video system, a             personal computer and printer and ancillary equipment.  Students at the         introductory and advanced levels, the majority of whom are women,               participate in research studies where they receive hands on experience          testing young children.  The additional equipment enables students to           study a wide range of developmental questions and learn a variety of            data collection techniques as well as learning up to date statistical           and computer programming skills.                                                                                                                                     The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
