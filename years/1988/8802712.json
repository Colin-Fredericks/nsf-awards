 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emma Previato will continue her research into integrable                   systems of differential equations and moduli problems in                        algebraic geometry. She will be studying some of the soliton                    equations which arise naturally in physics. In particular she                   will work with the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations. These model                various standing wave configurations and demonstrate many                       symmetries. Previato will be investigating the geometrical                      aspects of this theory. Since the special qualities possessed by                these integrable systems are algebraic in nature, her work will                 have impact in both differential and algebraic geometry.                             The major objective of the research is to embed integrable                 systems in moduli spaces in order to gain information on the                    latter's function theory and properties as projective varieties.                This offers potential applications to the study of moduli spaces                for vector bundles on curves as well as the possible discovery of               some new and interesting finite dimensional integrable systems.",
