 "awd_abstract_narration": "The FCCSET Committee report on a National High-Performance                 Computing Initiative was delivered to the United States Congress                on November 20, 1987, although the basic content of the section                 on Networking had been widely known since early summer.  The                    report recommends creation of a national data network to support                scientific research and scholarly activities in a three-tiered                  approach that coordinates and expands existing networks of the                  Federal Agencies that support research, while carrying out the                  research, development, and pilot deployment of the \"gigabit                     network\".                                                                            Community support, in the broadest sense, will be needed to                carry out so large a project successfully.  In this proposal,                   Richard Mandelbaum of NYSERNET, Inc. proposes to hold a large-                  scale planning conference with collaboration from EDUCOM, to plan               various aspects of design, construction, and use of the network                 including, for example:                                                                   * appropriate level of access,and relationship to                                 commercial X.25 networks;                                                     * suitability of SURANET or NYSERNET as a model for a                             national net;                                                                 * models of industrial participation; and                                       * funding mechanisms, including the partition of                                  funding among the Federal government, state and local                           governments, and end-users.                                              Participants will include university presidents and                        provosts; representatives of industry, especially                               telecommunication companies, financial institutions, and firms                  with large R & D investments; and government officials from                     national laboratories, public utility commissions, state boards                 of regents, and legislative committees.",
