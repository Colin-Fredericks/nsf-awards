The academic courses, which include experience with microcomputers              especially designed for the teachers are (1) Utilities; (2) LOGO; (3)           BASIC; (4) Applications to K-8 Curriculum; (5) Computer Concepts in             Programming; (6) Data Structures; (7) Application to High School                Curriculum.  The K-8 teacher will take courses (1) through (4); high            school teachers will take (1) through (3) and (7); while Advanced               Placement programming teachers will take (1) through (3), (5) and (6).          Courses will be offered during six weeks of the summer and bi-weekly            meetings on Saturday during the academic year for the local teachers.           In the two academic years, monthly on-site visits to in-state teachers          will be made.  There will also be a computer network and newsletter             for all participants.  Moreover, ten workshops per year will be held by         the lead teachers, who are given released time by their schools to help         colleagues meet certification requirements.  Academic credit will be            awarded by Western Carolina University (WCU) for those who complete the         work.",
