Also to compare the                   spectroscopic properties of these cytochrome bc1 complexes                      with the functionally analogous chloroplast cytochrome b6f                      complex.                                                                                                                                                        Emphasis is placed on unique aspects of bioenergetics in                        these bacteria or on the simplicity of processes in these                       bacteria compared to the analogous one in mitochondrial                         respiration.  A number of spectroscopic (e.g., resonance                        Raman and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy),                        biochemical (e.g., chemical modification of specific amino                      acids and photoaffinity labeling) and genetic techniques will                   be utilized in an attempt to provide details at the molecular                   level about these electron transfer reactions that are                          central to energy transduction in photosynthetic bacteria.                      %%%                                                                             The energy needed for cell metabolism is generated                              through several different mechanisms.  In this study,                           electron transport linked to an electrochemical gradient will                   be studied in a photosynthetic bacterium.  This is a                            convenient experimental system because electron transfer can                    be started and stopped by turning light on or off.",
