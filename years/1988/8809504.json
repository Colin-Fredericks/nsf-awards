 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electrical stimulation has been used effectively to excite                      nerves, muscles and brain nerve cells.  A more difficult problem                is to inhibit the firing of neurons using electrical stimulation.               A method for blocking neuronal firing would be extremely                        important any time abnormal neuronal firing interferes with the                 normal physiological functions such as in spasticity and in                     epilepsy.  Electrical fields have been used to block neuronal                   firing in axons.  Moreover, electrical fields applied in several                parts of the brain have been shown to modify the excitability of                neurons.  This research project proposes that these electrical                  field techniques be studied for the purpose of controlling                      abnormal neuronal firing in neural tissue.                                                                                                                      Preliminary experiments have shown that neuronal firing can be                  blocked when low-intensity, long current pulses are applied with                electrodes.  Neural recording techniques as well as computer                    modeling methods will be used to understand the mechanisms.  The                in vitro brain slice preparation will be used for this project,                 since it is possible to directly position the electrodes in the                 tissue to ensure a proper orientation of the electrical field.                                                                                                  The short-term impact of this project is to provide an                          understanding of the role of electrical fields in controlling                   abnormal neuronal activity.  The long-term impact of this project               is to generate the background knowledge for the design of the                   method for controlling and blocking abnormal epileptic                          activity.***//",
