 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cardiac function is controlled by neurotransmitters,                            neuromodulators, and drugs that bind to specific receptors                      located on the cardiac membrane.  These receptors interact with                 various effector mechanisms to regulate cellular activity.                      Adenosine is locally released in the heart and acts on specific                 extracellular, membrane.bound receptors to cause decrease in the                rate and force of contraction of the heart.  Furthermore, the                   rate of adenosine release in the myocardium is increased during                 exercise, hypoxia/ischemia and in the failing heart.  However,                  little is known concerning the pharmacological and biochemical                  characteristics of adenosine receptors and adenosine receptor:                  effector mechanisms in cardiac cells.  The long term goal of this               project is to elucidate the mechanisms by which activation of                   adenosine receptors lead to the regulation of cardiac function so               that pharmacological interventions affecting this system can                    ultimately be used to modify cardiac function.  There are two                   specific aims: (1) Extensive pharmacological and biochemical                    experiments will be performed to further characterize the                       adenosine receptor(s) in the heart.  These experiments will                     utilize three approaches: (a) ligand binding studies with both                  agonist and antagonist radioligands; (b) photoaffinity labelling;               and (c) affinity chromatography and receptor purification.  These               experiments will determine if more than one type of adenosine                   receptor exists in the heart and whether the cardiac adenosine                  receptors are the same or different from adenosine receptors in                 the CNS.  (2) Additional experiments will determine which                       effector system(s) is/are activated by cardiac adenosine                        receptors to result in the physiological changes induced by                     activation of adenosine receptors.  The mechanisms by which                     cardiac receptors modulate cAMP levels in the heart will be                     probed and the possibility that adenosine receptors couple to                   other effector systems will be examined.  The results are                       anticipated to provide fundamental insights to the processes by                 which adenosine receptors control cardiac function.",
