 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microarthropods influence rates of soil organic matter                  decomposition and nutrient release in forest ecosystems.  Their                 most important effects are assumed to occur through interactions                with the microflora.  Although microarthropods generally increase               decomposition rates of litter, their effects on nutrient fluxes                 in the forest floor have not been well documented.  This is                     especially true for nitrogen, which is often immobilized in                     decaying litter during the initial stages of decomposition.  This               one-year project will test and develop the methods for the long                 range study and will focus on:  1) identifying and quantifying                  potential non-target effects of naphthalene using both field and                laboratory approaches, 2) completing a one-year field study of                  the effects of microarthropod exclusion on litter decomposition                 rates, the microbial decomposer community, and nitrogen dynamics                in litter and soil pools, and 3) using 15N in conjunction with                  the litterbasket technique to quantify the effects of                           microarthropod exclusion on immobilization and movement through                 the forest floor profile of exogenous sources of nitrogen.                      Experiments will also be completed on the 15N labeling of litter                for use in long-term studies of decomposition and nitrogen                      mineralization.                                                                         //",
