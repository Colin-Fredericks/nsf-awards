 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aspects of design are increasingly being supported by                  computer-aided engineering (CAE) systems.  Most design activity                 is subject to the satisfaction of at least one design standard.                 CAE systems are most commonly developed by interpreting and                     reforming the provisions of standard into assignment statements                 and then hard-coding them into the system.  Such systems are                    inflexible (valid for one standard only), frequently invalidated                by changes in the standard, and subject to misinterpretation                    errors.  If, instead, the standard is declaratively represented,                and then presented to the CAE system to be manipulated (using                   tools provided by a knowledge-based standards processing system),               invalidation and misinterpretation would be lessened.  The design               system would also be more flexible, in that it could be made                    valid for another design standard by supplying the system with                  the representation of that standard.  A prototype of such a                     standards processor was developed in previous research by this                  principal investigator.  This prototype proved that standards                   could be separated from their usage, but it still requires much                 more research and development to be usable in computer-aided                    engineering system development.                                                      The objectives of this research are to completely recast                   the declarative representation of design standards as an                        object-oriented model, and to expand and modify the knowledge-                  based standards processor to address insufficiencies in the                     prototype.",
