 "awd_abstract_narration": "The advent of systematic studies of space plasmas by large-                scale and sophisticated computer simulations has brought in an                  exciting era to S/T research and has become an important                        component of the discipline.  This grant will support a numerical               study closely corroborated with analytical theory and                           observations.  It will continue research on the generic problems                of driven reconnection, current interruption, and magnetic energy               release and their manifestations in magnetospheric and solar                    plasmas.  This work is based on the following hypotheses: (i)                   Energetic substorms are primarily a process characterized not by                a spontaneous tearing process, but by driven linear and                         nonlinear instabilities.  Solar flares are the source of magnetic               wind disturbances, which induce the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability                in the magnetopause and in turn trigger substorms; (ii) The onset               of coronal flares is quite rapid and violent and is often a                     process (once again) driven by adjacent current carrying coronal                loops or photospheric mechanical motion; (iii) this mechanical                  motion is a manifestation of a more global motion of flux loops                 or matter beneath the photosphere through magnetic buoyancy and                 convective instabilities.  One example of such coupling: the                    twisting of current ropes beneath the photosphere causes buoyancy               of the ropes and conversely the emergence of loops in sheared                   magnetic fields gives rise to twisted loops.  It is intended to                 piece together the dynamic interplay of these physical processes                using insights obtained from simulation studies.  The overall aim               is to understand the basic plasma physical processes at the sun                 and their impact at the earth.",
