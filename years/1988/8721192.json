A consortium is proposed, integrating              individual missions of five principal investigators, together with              extensive support from consultants and collaborators, into a combined           geological-paleontological project, organized so as to bear upon the            pattern, conditions and consequences of the great radiation of                  metazoans during that time.  Major problems to be addressed include the         fidelity of the geological and fossil record during the transition, the         biostratigraphy and correlation of sections, the paleoenvironmental             settings represented, the fossil associations and paleobiodistributions         to be found, and the patterns of diversification of major metazoan              clades.  Methods include field work at key sections (including the US,          Australia, China and the USSR); laboratory analyses of samples and              specimens; compilation and evaluation of many stratigraphic sections;           compilation and analysis of databases of photoautotrophs, of shelly             invertebrates at the species level, and of the early radiations of all          phyla, classes and orders, living and fossil; and computer modelling of         the dynamics of the faunal radiations, turnovers and compositional              changes found during the transition.  Collaborators will provide                expertise on paleogeographical, paleomagnetic, geochemical,                     ichnological, taphonomic, statistical and computer modelling, as well           as on sedimentological and paleontological topics which lie beyond the          competence of the principal investigators.",
