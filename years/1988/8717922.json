 "awd_abstract_narration": "The question of where larvae develop remains unanswered                 for virtually all deep-sea invertebrates.  They must either                     ascend great distances to feed in surface waters and tolerate                   extreme changes in temperature, pressure, and other factors, or                 they must develop in a region which is too deep to support the                  small plants on which their near-shore counterparts feed.  In                   preliminary studies using manned submersibles, adults were                      collected and spawned, and the resulting larvae reared in the                   laboratory.  Contrary to predictions, the majority of species                   studied were planktotrophic (feeding) rather than                               lecithotrophic (non-feeding).  Moreover, the lecithotrophic                     species had buoyant eggs that probably develop at the surface.                  These findings were significant, as most previous studies of                    deep-sea reproduction were conducted using preserved material.                          This research proposes to compare developmental patterns                and rates, larval nutrition and dispersal potential for several                 echinoderm species (primarily sea urchins and starfish)                         occuring from shallow shelf habitats to the lower bathyal zone                  in Bahamian waters.",
