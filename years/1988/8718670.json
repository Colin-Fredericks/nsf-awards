 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to East Carolina University will allow a team of                     researchers to study small scale fishermen in Puerto Rico.                      They hypothesize that different degrees of involvement in wage                  labor will result in different levels of diversification,                       investment, and capital formation among fishing households.  The                cognitive orientation of the fishermen will be analyzed to see                  how it constrains their choices among economic alternatives.  The               project will interview about 200 randomly selected fishing                      households to get basic census ecological and economic data.                    Smaller subsamples will be selected for the collection of judged                similarity data that will be analyzed by various multivariate                   techniques to elicit the underlying cognitive structure.                                                                                                        This project is important because since WWII the world has seen a               sharpening of the international division of labor, with                         underdeveloped countries experiencing a growing working class.                  The economic activities of small scale proletarians in such                     societies are important in the overall economy, yet we know                     little about them.  The effects of these economic activities in                 the local economy, and their impact on the tropical marine                      environments are important topics that this research will help us               to understand.",
