 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses physical processes associated with melting               and melt segregation in the mantle, and how these processes affect              the geochemical properties of erupted lavas.  It is a natural                   extension of earlier work on mantle convection in that there is a               wealth of geochemical data with which to constrain and test                     various aspects of mantle dynamics, but in order to effectively                 use this data one must first understand how melts relate to their               mantle source both physically and chemically.  A two-dimensional                finite element numerical code will be used to study a hierarchy of              two-phase flow models involving melting and melt segregation: (i)               Melt segregation and trace element fractionation from a chemically              uniform source with spatially variable degree of melting.  The                  purpose is to illustrate and understand the complexity, including               time dependence, of the trace element concentrations in the                     \"melts\" segregating from such a source.  (ii) Melt segregation and              mixing from a source having heterogeneity in both chemistry and                 degree of melting.  This model will be applied to the time                      dependent geochemical properties of lavas from Hawaii and also as               a framework for modeling melt segregation for a source with                     ubiquitous heterogeneities, as seems to be required by the                      geochemistry of near-ridge seamounts.  (iii) Models for melting                 and melt migration under midocean ridges.  This type of model will              be used to study the implications of crustal thickness and major                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                element chemistry being quite insensitive to spreading rate while                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               the variability of trace element ratios and isotopic ratios is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  related to the rate of spreading.
