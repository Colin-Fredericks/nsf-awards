 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfields of spectroscopy and separation                   science.  Electronic spectroscopy affords a sensitive means of                  quantifying solutes.  Because faster time scales are now                        accessible to electronic spectroscopy, this tool can be more                    readily used to obtain structural information.  In particular,                  the size and shape of a solute determine its rotational diffusion               behavior.  Rotational diffusion studies of medium-sized organic                 molecules in common solvents require both picosecond spectroscopy               and the resolution of multiple exponentially decreasing response                signals.  Professor Wirth and her students will measure the three               components of the rotational diffusion constant of the solute                   tetracene which will enable an assessment of the extent to which                structural information can be derived from this approach.                       However, if the solvent has short-range structural order, the                   presence of the solvent could potentially limit the solute                      information that is obtained.  To address this issue, Professor                 Wirth will also study the effect of solvent structure on solute                 rotational diffusion.  The results of these studies are expected                to be valuable both to analytical spectroscopy and to an enhanced               fundamental understanding of liquids.",
