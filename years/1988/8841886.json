 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is part of the SUPER - Subarctic Pacific                     Ecosystem Research Program.  The Principal Investigator, Landry,                has moved from the University of Washington to the University of                Hawaii.  This is a change-of-institution action for the Principal               Investigator's award.                                                                   The project focuses on understanding the food web                       relationships and other upper ocean processes leading to the                    population dynamics of phytoplankton and zooplankton in the                     Subarctic Pacific, for comparison with the North Atlantic in                    which similar work had been done. Initially, work in the                        Subarctic Pacific centered on the larger size fractions of both                 phytoplankton and zooplankton and on the notion that                            phytoplankton growth was continuously balanced by zooplankton                   feeding (the Major Grazer Hypothesis).  Unusual characteristics                 of the surface water mass allowed the maintenance of higher                     zooplankton abundance in the euphotic zone, thus allowing                       zooplankton to closely track any phytoplankton increases.  The                  lag seen in the North Atlantic System is not seen.                                      The results of the initial SUPER Program, indicate that                 zooplankton numbers/feeding capabilities are 10X too low to                     account for the balance of populations, and that the copepods                   must have a direct feeding connection to microzooplankton                       (heterotrophic flagellates and ciliates).  The Major Grazer                     Hypothesis is not an accurate paradigm of the ecosystem dynamics;               an alternative Limited Mixing/Micrograzer Hypothesis has been                   forwarded and tests of this new hypothesis are now underway.                    This involves comparisons of phytoplankton (all sizes) production               rates with zooplankton (all sizes) grazing rates, and a                         quantitative assessment of nitrogen dynamics as a basis for                     estimates of phytoplankton production capabilities.",
