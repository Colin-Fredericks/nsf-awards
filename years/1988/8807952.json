 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides funds for two different items of                          specialized research equipment.  The first includes various                     pieces of equipment to build a static vapor-liquid equilibrium                  cell.  This equipment would allow for the measurement of                        vapor-liquid equilibrium in classes of mixtures, of both                        industrial and academic importance, that are not currently                      possible at the University of Delaware.  The second item is a Sun               Workstation for use in theoretical and modelling related to phase               equilibrium studies, as well as a gateway for use in                            supercomputer work.  Uniqueness/Innovation:  The vapor-liquid                   equilibrium data to be obtained are for new mixtures of interest                in process modelling, developing and testing new thermodynamic                  models, and determining the applicability of group contribution                 methods.  Current equipment restricts studies to mixtures whose                 relative volatility is approximately ten or less.  The new phase                equilibrium equipment would allow for a large extension of this,                and, thus, allow for consideration of many mixtures that cannot                 now be studied.                                                                                                                                                 Currently, the data obtained are being used to determine new                    group contribution parameters and to test the industrially                      important group contribution method.  In addition, some data are                used directly by industry for example, by DuPont in the design of               a process to make a new polymer and by Chevron in reservoir                     simulation.",
