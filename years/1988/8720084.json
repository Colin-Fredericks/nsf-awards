 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to support research to find                        principles of organization that can account for experimental                    data on the cellular level and on various higher levels.                        Specific objectives include:  clarifying the dependence of                      learning on synaptic modification, elucidating the principles                   that govern synapse formation or modification, constructing a                   molecular model for synaptic modificaton, constructing network                  models that can compute, learn, associate, and reproduce such                   higher level cognitive acts as abstraction, language acquisition,               and speech recognition.  By testing critical theories, the                      principal investigator will attempt to obtain a better                          understanding of the basic biological mechanisms by which the                   cental nervous system learns and organizes itself and acquires                  its capacity for mental acts.                                                                                                                                   The principal and coprincipal investigators are well funded and                 well versed in a wide variety of techniques and theoretical                     frameworks germane to the research proposed.  They are well                     qualified to conduct the research.  The interaction of                          theoreticians and experimentalists will allow the coupling of                   theory and experimentation, a major strength of this proposal.                  Support is recommended.",
