 "awd_abstract_narration": "An insect society, such as an ant colony, represents a                  critical test case for general theories of evolution, as Darwin                 himself recognized.  Ant workers are sterile, and in general                    their sole means of reproduction resides with their mother queen.               A fairly common yet unstudied characteristic of ants is that a                  colony can split up into several discrete nesting units, a                      process called polydomy.  When this happens, workers in colony                  subunits without the queen are released from her influence, and                 can proceed to behave in ways to maximize their own fitness.                    Thus studying polydomy, the process of colony fractionation, is                 important to a  full understanding of social evolution.  Polydomy               is best studied by applying hierarchical selection models.  In                  these formulations, evolution proceeds on several levels:  the                  entire colony; different nesting units that comprise the colony;                and individual workers and queens within those nesting units                    represent levels in the selection hierarchy.  Dr. Herbers will                  study the process of colony fractionation among primitive ant                   species in Australia, where polydomy is just now beginning to                   evolve.  A combination of field studies, laboratory aggression                  assays between members of different nests, and biochemical                      analysis will allow her to determine when and how often colonies                split up.  Furthermore, measuring the fitness of all individuals                within nests will provide insight into the nature of selection at               each level in the hierarchy.                                                            This is a proposal for a Career Advancement Award under the             aegis of the Research Opportunities for Women.  It is likely to                 result in a significant enhancement of the scientific field as                  well as Dr. Herbers' own career.",
