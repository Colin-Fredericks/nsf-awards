 "awd_abstract_narration": "Congress, in the Conference Report accompanying the FY 88                       Appropriations Act, recommended that NSF use $1.5M \"for proposals               to use computing capabilities not available at national                         supercomputer centers\".  It was further stated that \"all research               directorates should be invloved in funding supercomputer time                   required as part of research\".                                                                                                                                  In accordance with this direction, all the program directors at                 the Foundation were notified in mid-February 1988 that such                     computer time would be supported per the above Conference                       Committee recommendation, and that they should respond by 4/1                   with any requests for such time.  By this cut-off date twenty                   three requests for time were received, all for use of the Cray 2                at the Minnesota Supercomputer Center (MSC).  The total requests                exceeded the allocated resources available so some reduction of                 the request total was negotiated with the individual PD's.                                                                                                      The research directorates involved in this grant are BBS, CISE,                 ENG, GEO, and MPS.  The total request is for 2000 hours of                      computer time, which, at the rate quoted by MSC, equals the $1.5M               recommended by Congress.",
