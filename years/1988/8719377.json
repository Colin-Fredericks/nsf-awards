 "awd_abstract_narration": "A properly functioning brain requires development of the most                   highly precise connectivity known among cells.  Assembly of such                specific neural circuits during development depends on two very                 different kinds of mechanisms.  First, individual neurons (nerve                cells) carry molecular labels that determine the outlines of the                circuit to be assembled; the mechanism called chemoaffinity                     allows the growing processes of a cell to \"recognize\" the                       molecular label on the proper target cells.  Second, there are                  ways in which this assembly from chemoaffinity can be modified.                 Nervous systems are dynamic structures, and the wiring diagrams                 may be affected by competition between cells for available                      contact sites, by internal irregularities and by different                      environmental circumstances acting on the animal.                                                                                                               This project is a high resolution examination of the dynamic                    aspects of circuit assembly.  A model system, the cricket, has                  been chosen because it contains large identifiable single neurons               that have been well defined for their detailed structure,                       specific connections, and physiological properties.  In crickets,               the growth stages are well defined, and regeneration of processes               allows examination of connection formation at a variety of                      stages.  Some of the defined circuits in the cricket are                        relatively simple structures that are very accessible for                       physiology and anatomy.  The synapses, which are the functional                 sites of communication between nerve cells, will be examined to                 see whether the physiological transmission of signals changes                   during maturation, whether there are changes at the                             ultrastructural in these synapses during reorganization, whether                the incoming process controls the strength of the synapse, and                  whether the strength of different terminals depends on                          competition of some sort.  Results will have an impact on both                  developmental biology as well as neuroscience; the need for fine                tuning of connections is a hallmark of all nervous systems.",
