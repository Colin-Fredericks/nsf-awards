 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry provides                     support for the research of Dr. Edward Clennan, University of                   Wyoming. The work focuses on reactions of singlet oxygen. This                  form of oxygen is an excited or energetic one. A number of                      biological processes related to aging are thought to involve                    singlet oxygen and a fundamental understanding of its reaction                  chemistry is, thus, closely linked to important biological                      problems.                                                                                                                                                       Mechanistic studies of the reactions of singlet oxygen with                     electron rich dienes and with sulfides will be studied. The                     synthesis of substrates to probe singlet oxygen reactions for                   electron transfer and anchimeric assistance effects will be                     undertaken.  The effect of solvent, temperature, and additives                  on product distributions formed in the reactions of these                       substrates with singlet oxygen will be examined.  Low                           temperature NMR will be utilized to detect intermediates and                    the emission of singlet oxygen at 1200nm will be monitored in                   the presence of these substrates in order to obtain important                   kinetic information. Intramolecular trapping of singlet oxygen                  intermediates will be pursued with sulfoxide trapping groups.                   Intramolecular trapping has the advantage that symmetry                         information on the intermediate can be ascertained. The effect                  of substitutents on the trapping ability of the sulfoxide                       groups will be carefully examined.",
