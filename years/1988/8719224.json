 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a two-year program of work to simulate the global                  distributions of 222Rn and 210Pb in the troposphere, using a                    three-dimensional model.  Radon-222 (half-life 3.8 days) is                     released to the atmosphere by soils; it decays to 210Pb (half-                  life 22.3 years), which is rapidly incorporated into aerosol                    particles and is removed by deposition.  The 222Rn/210Pb system                 is an excellent tracer of vertical mixing, advection of                         continental air over oceans and polar regions, and long-rang                    transport of aerosols.  Long-term time series of measured                       concentrations are available from a large number of sites                       around the world.  Successful interpretation of the                             observations with a 3-d model will advance significantly our                    understanding of long-rang transport of pollutants in the                       troposphere.  The 3-d model to be used in this study has been                   shown previously to provide excellent simulations of the                        distributions of long-lined tracers(CFC's 8.5Kr). The first                     effort will be to model 222Rn distributions over North America.                 Model results will be evaluated by comparison with observed                     time series of 222Rn concentrations in the United States.                       Transport of pollutants from the boundary layer to the free                     troposphere will be investigated.  Global simulations of 222Rn                  will be used to study long-range transport in the southern                      hemisphere, on the basis of extensive time series of                            concentrations measured at subantarctic and antarctic sites.                    The latter part of the project will involve global simulations                  of 210Pb, with emphasis on interpreting observations over                       North America, the Pacific Ocean, the Arctic, and the Antarctic                 Results from the 210Pb study will support an investigation of                   long-range transport of continental aerosol over oceans and                     polar regions.",
