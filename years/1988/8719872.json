 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adaptive responses to physiological stressors like hypoglycemia,                hypotension, and exposure to cold are mediated by changes in                    neuroendocrine activity.  The relationships between these                       environmental stimuli and cell responsiveness at the molecular                  level are central to an understanding of biological adaption                    throughout development and to mechanisms of phenotypic expression               in maturity.  Many of these relationships require tissue-                       specific gene control in which factors initiating transcription                 are critical determinants of physiological function or of choices               made during development.  Indeed, in this context, the next                     logical step in elucidating mechanisms of transcription control                 requires identification and isolation of factors which bind to                  regulatory sequences of DNA (i.e. at promoters or enhancer                      sites).  Dr. La Gamma has identified a transsynaptic mechanism                  through which co-localized preproenkephalin and catecholamine                   transmitter genes (tyrosine hydroxylase) are related                            differentially in the rat adrenal medulla.  Dr. LaGamma proposes                to conduct experiments to describe an approach to identify and                  characterize putative regulatory molecules in this native                       eukaryotic tissue.  He will employ transcription \"run-off\"                      assays, the DNA \"shift\" assay, and the exoIII protection assay to               identify transsynaptic regulatory proteins that alter expression                of enkephalin and tyrosine hydroxylase genes.  Future work is                   planned to partially purify adrenomedullary nuclear proteins in                 conditions where preproenkephalin gene transcription is altered.                Once purified and characterized, future work may lead to the                    development of synthetic molecules in this and other systems that               can read large scale sequences of DNA and produce new research                  tools for use in molecular biology, diagnosis of disease, and                   even new chemotherapeutic strategies.  In this way, the role of                 environmental stimuli on nervous system function can begin to be                explained or modified at the cellular and molecular levels.",
