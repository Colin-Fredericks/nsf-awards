 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I                          project is in the general area of analytical and surface                        chemistry and in the subfield of electrochemistry.  The                         thrust of this experimental activity is to evaluate the                         feasibility of utilizing new, high surface area carbon and                      graphite anodes as electrodes for oxidative                                     electrosyntheses.  The number of stable, inexpensive anode                      materials available for use in electrosynthetic processes                       is quite limited.  This Phase I activity capitalizes on new                     technology that has recently been developed by The                              Electrosynthesis Company.  These materials have been found                      to be stable in strongly acidic media at high oxidation                         potentials.  The efficacy of these materials relative to                        noble metals is being evaluated for use in four                                 industrially important electrochemical processes:                               electrosyntheses of sodium perchlorate, persulfate, ozone,                      and dimethyl sebacate.                                                                                                                                          These new electrode materials could provide equivalent or                       better performance than platinum, thereby resulting in                          lower cell capital and operating costs for the production                       of the desired chemicals.  The potential commercial                             importance of this project is substantial in that                               replacement of a strategic material (platinum) is                               addressed.",
