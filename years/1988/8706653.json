 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research proposed focuses on developing algorithms and system               software for a high-performance multicomputer system.  A multicomputer          system consists of a large number of interconnected computing nodes             that asynchronously cooperate via message passing to execute the tasks          of parallel programs.  Each network node, fabricated as a small number          of VLSI chips, contains a processor, a local memory, and (preferably) a         communication controller capable of routing messages without delaying           the computation processor.  The recent appearance of commercial                 multicomputer systems (i.e., hypercubes), with rudimentary software             support, allows testing of many new ideas in operating systems,                 algorithms, communication, and parallel programming.                                                                                                            Because there is no global memory, a multicomputer system supporting            computations that dynamically create tasks must schedule those tasks on         idle nodes using information local to the area where the tasks were             created.  Problem partitioning and new algorithm designs for                    communicating tasks must be explored if multicomputer systems are to be         used effectively.  In addition, communication software capable of               efficiently routing messages to their destination are needed.  The PI           has partially tested, via analysis and simulation, many techniques and          ideas for resolving these problems in scheduling and routing.  Picasso,         a hypercube operating system with modules for dynamic task scheduling           and adaptive message routing, is being developed to experimentally              explore the interaction of task scheduling, adaptive routing                    algorithms, and algorithm design.",
