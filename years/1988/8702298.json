 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study proposes to evaluate the changes in the serum levels of              progesterone, etradiol, LH, FSH and prolactin during the estrous cycle          of the Djungarian hamster during pregnancy and during a pregnancy block         induced by mating with 2 males.  The first experiment will elucidate            the gonadotropic hormones during the estrous cycle with focus on the            events surrounding ovulation, since this is the only short cycle rodent         known that does not exhibit an increase in serum levels of progesterone         on proestrus.  The second experiment ascertains the gonadotropin and            steroid changes in sera on proestrus associated with mating to a single         male (normal pregnancy).  Hormonal patterns will also be determined in          early pregnancy.  In addition the effects of mating to a single male on         the number of ova shed and the timing of ovulation will be determined.          The third experiment will ascertain the effects of mating females with          2 males on hormonal patterns. The double mating (with 2 males) causes a         pregnancy block even though ovulation and behavioral estrus return 4            days later (no pseudopregnancy or prolonged cycle is observed).  A              histological assessment of the morphology of the corpora lutea and              classification (staging) of follicles during the cycle, early pregnancy         and pregnancy block will be assessed in order to characterize the               luteal-follicular shift associated with the pregnancy block and                 subsequent return to estrus.  These studies will provide insight into           the effects of mating with one or two (or no) males on hormonal                 patterns and thus allow the development of a hypothesis as to the               hormonal mechanisms associated with the pregnancy blockage.",
