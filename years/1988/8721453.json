 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research studies the speech of several generations of                      Spanish-English bilinguals in Los Angeles, California, and of a                 control group of Spanish speakers in two communities in Mexico                  from which there is large-scale emigration to Los Angeles.                      Questions addressed include precisely how the Spanish of the                    immigrants changes under the direct influence of English and what               changes are the result of internally motivated processes, what                  type of lexico-syntactic transfer occurs at each point across the               bilingual spectrum, what types of compensation are developed in                 response to loss and simplification, and how changes proceed both               in the linguistic and the social systems.                                                                                                                       Empirical answers to these questions are of concern not only for                linguistics but for social policy and education as well.                        Comparison of the speech of immigrants in Los Angeles with the                  speech of people who stayed behind in Mexico clarifies the issue                of which changes are the result of Spanish/English bilingualism                 and which are processes with their roots in the language of the                 feeder communities.",
