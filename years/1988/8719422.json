 "awd_abstract_narration": "The terminal nerve is a cranial nerve found in all classes                 of vertebrates.  Peripherally, this nerve connects to the nasal                 epithelium.  There is very little hard evidence which tells us                  the function of the terminal nerve.  However, this nerve has been               previously implicated in sensory and motor functions and just                   recently it has been implicated in the control of certain                       reproductive processes.  One hypothesis is that the chemosensory                component of this nerve detects sexual pheromones and facilitates               reproductive behavior by releasing LHRH into brain areas                        controlling sexual activity, reproductive reflexes and                          gonadotropin secretion.  Dr. Leo Demski has been studying the                   terminal nerve and will continue his work by taking advantage of                unique features of the system in stingrays, its separation from                 the olfactory tract and its large ganglion which has                            characteristics suggesting neurosecretion directly into cerebral                vessels.  Sophisticated neuroanatomical and developmental                       techniques will be employed to define the precise functions of                  the terminal nerve.",
