 "awd_abstract_narration": "A 200 MHz Gemini Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance                   Spectrometer is being integrated into the undergraduate chemistry               curriculum for chemical analysis.  Chemistry laboratory instruction is          being improved in six regularly offered courses, one interim course,            and the undergraduate research program of the department.  Students are         being introduced to the FT-NMR in the sophomore organic chemistry               course and receive hands-on experience with this state-of-the-art,              computer-controlled laboratory instrument as juniors and seniors.  The          high-field NMR technique produces simplified proton NMR spectra                 allowing for a more thorough interpretation of spectra by the students          and thereby enhancing their ability to use NMR in the identification            of compounds they have prepared.  They are also becoming familiar with          Carbon-13 NMR as an important tool for structural elucidation of                substances.  Computer control of the instrument is allowing for                 collection, manipulation, and rapid analysis of data including two-             dimensional NMR.
