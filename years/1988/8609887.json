 "awd_abstract_narration": "The flow cytometry/cell sorting facility of the University of Wiscon-           sin, Department of Zoology will expanded and upgraded.  This facility,          established initially with funds from the National Science Foundation           augmented by supplemental funding from the University of Wisconsin and          the National Institutes of Health, now serves the campus-wide research          community.  New advances in technology as well as the increased use of          flow cytometric techniques in a broad range of research studies drive           the need to upgrade the facility.  The facility as a whole serves               broadly many types of research work in immunology, physiology, develop-         mental biology regulatory biology, cell biology, molecular biology and          genetics.  The staff serve as a major source of expertise for the               design of experiments utilizing flow cytometric techniques, and the             facility has as one of its key functions the carrying out of ex-                ploratory and feasibility studies.  A new analytical sorter will be             obtained with 50% cost sharing between NSF and the University of                Wisconsin.  The facility has been place on line to University central           facility, via a DECNET, allowing general user access.//",
