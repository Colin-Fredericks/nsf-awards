 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a series of small U.S.-French workshops on              the topic of input-output analysis of household consumption.  The               workshops will be organized by Professors Wassily Leontief and Faye             Duchin of the Institute for Economic Analysis, New York University,             and on the French side by Dr. Bernard Real, Groupe de Recherche sur             les Besoins, University of Social Sciences, Grenoble.  The                      workshops aim to establish a framework for a detailed                           representation and analysis of the changing structure of households             and their activities, which will eventually be integrated within                the input-output model of the productive sectors of the economy                 already developed by the Institute for Economic Analysis.                                                                                                       Specifically the workshops will develop guidelines for a detailed,              quantitative description of households and their activities and                 will develop a methodology for projecting future household                      consumption activities reflecting different technological                       innovations by the following steps:  1) establishment of an                     operational concept of household consumption activities and units               of measurement; 2) a systematic and comprehensive classification                scheme for households; 3) analysis of household activities in terms             of a set of processes and the technological requirements for                    carrying out these processes; 4) application of the methodology                 developed in the previous steps to the U.S. Consumer Expenditure                Surveys for 1982-83; and 5) a series of field studies concerning                adoption of innovations by households.  These steps will provide                the framework for a model capable of analyzing technological change             in different types of households.  Under this proposal a prototype              framework will be developed for a limited number of households and              process categories capable of expansion to a more comprehensive                 model in future work.  The qualifications of the U.S. and French                participants are outstanding.  Professor Leontief is a Nobel                    laureate, who continues to dominate the research in input-output                technology.  The results of this joint project should provide                   valuable information for economic researchers working on the                    subject of the impact of automation on labour.",
