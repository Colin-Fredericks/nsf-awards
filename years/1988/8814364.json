 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development and use of a new heat flux gage system that is                  made using microfabrication techniques is proposed.  The goal is                to produce a system that has the capability to accurately measure               time-resolved heat flux in unsteady flows.  To accomplish this,                 novel heat flux gages have been designed that are small, have                   high frequency response, and are capable of measuring very high                 convective heat flux rates.  By using high-temperature metals and               ceramics as the gage components, operation over a wide                          temperature range can also be achieved (0 to 1000 Degrees                       Celsius).  In addition, a new calibration system has been                       designed for the gages by making use of their very fast time                    response.  The gages will consist of a thin layer of insulating                 material with many thermocouples positioned across it to form a                 differential thermopile.  The overall thickness of approximately                1 micrometer will give negligible flow and thermal disruption                   with response times on the order of 5 microseconds.  The surface                size will be on the order of 0.2 mm by 2 mm.  This will be                      achieved using thin film techniques associated with                             photolithography as commonly used for miniature electronic                      circuits.  The measurement capabilities of the gages will be                    demonstrated in unsteady flows over a frequency range of 10 to                  10,000 Hz and for flow velocities from low speed to supersonic.                                                                                                 The combination of all of these characteristics in one heat flux                gage would make this a major advancement in heat transfer                       instrumentation.  Measurements would be possible that simply                    couldn't be made previously.  The high frequency response allows                direct measurement of time-resolved heat flux to observe the                    details of turbulent flows, the details of rotor wake effects at                operating speeds of gas turbine engines, the details of the two-                phase flow in fluidized beds, the effects of tube vibration in                  heat exchangers, and numerous other applications.  Although it is               very commonplace to make detailed fluid dynamic measurements of                 such unsteady flows, the capability to make corresponding                       unsteady heat transfer measurements has not been well developed.                In addition, applications where the high heat flux capability are               important include fundamental and applied heat transfer in such                 diverse fields as boiling and condensation, hypersonic flow, flow               in shock tubes, high-sped turbomachinery (including gas turbine                 engines), processes using jet impingement heat transfer, and                    high-speed planes and rocket nozzles.  As can be seen, much                     further research would be made possible by the development and                  demonstration of this heat transfer measurement capability.",
