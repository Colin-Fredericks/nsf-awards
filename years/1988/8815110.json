The U.S. Coordinator is Dr. Tschango John Kim, Professor and             Associate Director, International Programs and Studies, University of           Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who is a member of the ARSC Organizing            Committee.  He will be assisted in the selection of participants by             Dr. Goeffrey J. D. Hewings, Professor and Head, Department of                   Geography, University of Illinois, Dr. Peter Gordon, Associate Dean,            School of Urban and Regional Planning, University of Southern                   California, and Dr. Koichi Mera, Professor of Commerce, Tokyo                   International University.  Drs. Kim and Mera have overall                       responsibility for organizing the ARSC.  The Local Organizing                   Committee is being Co-Chaired by Dr. Phisit Pakkasem, Deputy Director           General, National Economic and Social Development Board, and                    Dr. Hiranya D. Dias, Department of Human Settlements Development, Asian         Institute of Technology, Bangkok.                                                                                                                               The major theme of the conference will be Socioeconomic Development of          the Southeast Asian Region, especially focusing on applications of              regional science methods to regional development problems in developing         countries.  The major objective of the ARSC is to identify a priority           research agenda in regional science in the Southeast Asian region.  In          addition to the benefits to be derived from the exchange of scientific          information in formal sessions, the ARSC will provide two days of field         visits to industrial and cultural sites in Thailand.  The 10 developing         country scientists, partially supported by this project, will be                selected from Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, and              Bangladesh.  Other scientists from South Asia, the Western Pacific Rim,         and Europe are expected to participate.  Selection procedures will give         special attention to assure participation of a significant number of            younger U.S. scientists.  The coordinators of this international                conference are highly respected regional scientists with extensive              experience in organizing international cooperative activities. This             project is relevant to the objectives of the Science in Developing              Countries (SDC) Program which seeks to increase the level of                    cooperation between U.S. scientists and engineers and their                     counterparts in developing countries through the exchange of scientific         information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on         problems of mutual benefit.  Under the SDC Program, conferences may be          supported to explore the application of science and technology to               development problems.  This project supports the SDC Program in each of         these areas through the scientific exchanges and cooperative activities         proposed.",
