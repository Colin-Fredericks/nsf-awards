 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project involves research on intraband (as opposed to interband)            processes in semiconductor devices and related research on new device           concepts.  The research will include electronic and infrared                    measurements as well as device physics theory and modeling.  The                research will be oriented toward improved understanding of intraband            process in silicon and selectively doped A1GaAs/GaAs and toward                 concepts which could contribute to the development of (A) ultrafast             devices for logic, infrared data transmission, and oscillator                   applications, (B) new types of infrared detectors and (C) new means of          electronic implementation of neural networks.  Some of the proposed             work is exploratory while other aspects represent a continuation of             current research.  In accord with our predictions, intraband processes          involving tunneling and photoexcitation have been found to have                 special advantages in terms of electronic switching speed and the               ability to tailor infrared detectors for optimal response at                    particular wavelengths.  The research will deal with issues related to          picosecond switching and the analogous frequency domain for                     heterostructure devices.  The work will include analysis of                     corrections to the standard treatment of Tsu-Esaki tunneling as well            as electron-electron interactions and heterostructure interface                 roughness.  Infrared detector concepts involving nonlinear effects in           extrinsic silicon devices and heterostructures will be developed and            effects at impurity band interfaces will be studied.",
