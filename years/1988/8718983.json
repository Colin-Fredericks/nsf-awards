 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigation of quantum-mechanical many-body systems has                   been an important focus of theoretical researchers in statistical               physics.  They use Green's function Monte Carlo and path integral               Monte Carlo to provide detailed microscopic information about the               properties of quantum systems, especially quantum fluids and                    crystals.                                                                       They will continue to study the structure of two- and three-                    dimensional quantum fluids and solids and the nature of the                     melting-freezing transition at T = 0 and above.  They will                      emphasize the development of improved solid trial wavefunctions.                Studies of the changes in higher-order correlation functions as                 the system freezes will be continued.  They intend to calculate                 properties such as elastic constants in two and three dimensions                and the role of topological defects in two dimensions.  The                     computational results will be interpreted with the help of                      empirical and of density-functional theories.  They will also                   attempt to construct phenomenological density matrices to                       describe Bose fluids and to investigate pressure melting of                     Yukawa quantum systems.  Another new area will be the                           investigation into the properties of inhomogeneous systems,                     including slabs with liquid-vapor interfaces, quantum vortices,                 droplets having large angular momenta, impurities in liquid                     Helium 4, and two-dimensional systems adsorbed on a substrate.                  Studies will be continued of the effects of various proposed                    Helium-Helium potentials.",
