 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide 12 undergraduate faculty with hands-on                experience in three areas of ecology: 1) experimental assessment of             pollinator responses to amino acids in nectars, 2) telemetric                   monitoring in ecology, and 3) control of nitrogen fixation in aquatic           microorganisms.  Participants will be given appropriate reading                 materials and laboratory methods devised by the project directors.              Methods of instruction will include lectures and discussions but will           primarily depend on field and laboratory work with the project                  directors.  Associated with the studies in these areas, participants            will learn to devise hypotheses, conduct experiments, and analyze and           present the resulting data.  They will use computers for data analysis          and presentation and will learn to make 35 mm slides for oral                   presentations.  Finally, they will develop laboratory exercises for             their own courses and may be able to initiate new undergraduate                 research projects with their own students.  After using and evaluating          at least one of the laboratory exercises in a course, they will share           their results with the other members of the group.                                                                                                              In addition to the NSF funds, participants' institutions will                   contribute about 15% in travel costs, and the grantee institution will          contribute about 10% in additional operating costs.",
