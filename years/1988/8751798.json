 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a five year project in which thirty secondary science                   teachers from Howard County, Baltimore County and Baltimore City                will participate in a research program at two campuses of the                   University of Maryland, UMAB and UMBC.  The summer components                   will consist of a seven week, full time research practicum in the               biological/biomedical sciences and a seven session research                     colloquium.  The colloquium has three distinct foci:  principles                of research methodology, recent advances in specific research                   area and translation of research methodology into the classroom.                The classroom application will be the focus of monthly colloquia                during the school year.  Scientists from the University of                      Marlyand will act as mentors for the research and science                       educators from each LEA will direct the pedagogical aspects of                  the program.                                                                                                                                                    Six teachers will be phased in each year of the project with each               teacher participating for three years. School districts are cost-               sharing a good portion of the total cost to insure that this                    strategy for teaching science and the introduction of research                  methodology into the classroom is implemented. The project will                 lead to an increased understanding of content and appreciation of               biological knowledge, preparation for curriculum redesign and                   improvement, establishment of a cadre of \"master teacher\" with                  research experience, and increased interactions among                           participating teachers and faculty of the University of Maryland.",
