 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growth in complexity of computerized systems now requires                   professionals who are not just programmers, but who can also contribute         to the advance of Computer Science and to the implementation of                 advanced methods in their workplace.  To meet this need The University          of West Florida has recently reorganized its undergraduate programs to          emphasize the discipline of Software Enginering and the methodologies           for the analysis and control of software.                                                                                                                       To complement these changes more students should have an opportunity to         participate in research.  We propose the establishment of a site for            undergraduate research in Computer Science.  The initial period of              operation would be for two years with seven students being supported in         each year.                                                                                                                                                      Students would work on specific projects defined by faculty with                careful structuring to guarantee each student's active participation.           The objectives is to provide the student with an effective learning             experience, both in the specific area in which he is working and in the         methodology of Computer Science research.                                                                                                                       Student participants will be chosen competitively; qualified minority           and women students will be specifically encouraged to participate.              Equipment and faculty time are available to sustain the program.",
