 "awd_abstract_narration": "87-51730 Enrichment in Modern Physics is a two year program for 24 high         school physics teachers from the Central New York region.  This project         is designed to provide concentrated study in modern physics for                 underprepared teachers from rural school districts.  In addition,               teachers will receive training in pedagogical techniques that will              permit them to introduce modern physics topics in their high school             courses.  During the first three-week summer workshop participants will         receive training in atomic physics, solid-state theory, conductivity and        semiconductor physics.  During the second summer they will cover topics         in gravitational physics, astronomy, nuclear physics, and quantum               phenomena.  Both summer workshops include laboratory components aimed at        providing the participants with a number of inexpensive demonstrations          and hands-on activities in modern physics which can be used in high             school physics courses.  Participants will become part of the SUNY,             Cortland Physics Sharing Group which provides continuing in-service             support for physics teachers in the central New York region.  This              project has been designed as a model to address the urgent need to train        teachers to include modern physics in the high school physics course.                                                                                           The State University of New York at Cortland and several School                 Districts of Central New York have contributed an amount equal to 40% of        the NSF award.",
