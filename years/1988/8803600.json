 "awd_abstract_narration": "The October 1, 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake generated strong                ground motions that were recorded by numerous accelerograph stations            throughout southern California.  One station, located in Tarzana,               approximately 44 kilometers west of the earthquake's epicenter,                 recorded unusually high peak accelerations.  The peak accelerations,            which are high frequency motions, are between 4 and 10 times greater            than the peak accelerations recorded at nearby stations.  The Tarzana           accelerograph was calibrated shortly after the earthquake, and no               indication of instrument malfunction was apparent in the strong motion          accelerogram.                                                                                                                                                   This research project will investigate this anomalously high                    acceleration recording, on the supposition that it was a result of              soil-structure interaction between the accelerograph station and the            soil in which it is embedded.  Such an effect was found to exist in an          earlier study by the principal investigator at an accelerograph                 station that had a number of design features in common with the                 Tarzana station.                                                                                                                                                The purpose to this study is (1) to determine the extent of any soil-           structure interaction that may have contributed to the large recorded           accelerations, (2) develop reliable analytical models to predict the            soil-structure interaction effects at this station, and (3) remove the          soil-structure interaction effects from the accelerogram to obtain the          free-field motion.",
