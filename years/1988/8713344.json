 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide partial support for a cooperative research              project in agroecosystem modeling between Dr. Edward T. Elliott,                Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory, Colorado State University (CSU),           and other CSU scientists; Professor David C. Coleman, University of             Georgia; Dr. Lijbert Brussaard, Institute for Soil Fertility, Haren,            The Netherlands; and other Dutch colleagues.  The U.S. scientists have          developed two agroecosystem simulation models, one that simulates               detailed site-level information on a time scale of a year, and the              other that simulates large-scale and long-term changes in soil organic          matter, nutrient availability, and primary production as affected by            ecosystem management.  The Dutch investigators in this project are              actively pursuing experimental research and modeling that is similar,           yet complementary, to that being carried out by the U.S. researchers.           Both groups believe that comparison of model structures, outputs, and           conceptual bases for development of the U.S. and Dutch work will be             mutually beneficial.  Reciprocal visits to each other's research                facilities are planned.  Additional travel support for members of the           U.S. group is being provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.                                                                                             The simulation models described here are useful tools in synthesizing           and integrating knowledge of agroecosystems.  They are so designed that         new agricultural practices can be superimposed on the model structure           and the consequences evaluated.  Cooperation with the scientists in The         Netherlands will help improve and validate the U.S. models, and in              addition is expected to lead to the design of specific new experiments          that may be carried out on a collaborative basis.",
