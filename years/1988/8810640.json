 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is directed at the investigation of a tool that makes use         of knowledge about constraints to support the development of user views         and update propagation semantics for object-oriented database                   applications.  Informally, an object-oriented database system is a              system that combines the use of abstraction in semantic modeling with           programming language concepts such as abstract data types as a means of         protecting the semantics of data.  The proposed database design support         tool will actively make use of data semantics through an approach known         as constraint analysis.  Using constraint analysis, the effects of data         constraint are made explicit in the desing phase to support the                 specification of user views and database update operations.  The use of         constraint analysis as a design tool, however, assumes that data will be        accessed in a database environment supported by a sophisticated                 contraint enforcement system that enforces both inherent schema                 constraints and explicit constraints expressed using a constraint               language.  An expected result of the proposed research is the                   development of an object-oriented database system with a constraint             management and enforcement facility that allows data constraints to plan        an integral part in the specification of database software.",
