 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Engineering Research Equipment Grant will be used to upgrade the           MicroVAX II system of the Department of Electrical                              Engineering to serve both as a computational resource and as a                  local area network server for PC's, terminals, and new graphics                 workstations.  This will provide the Department with an efficient link          to a Cyber 205 supercomputer on campus which can be used                        effectively by faculty and students to extend their ability to                  perform research at a more advanced level.  The goal is to pursue               numerical procedures and techniques for the solution of 3-                      dimensional electromagnetics problems involving objects of both                 arbitrary shape and arbitrary material composition. Such problems               generally require 1) extensive volumetric geometric input data,                 which can only be practically generated and checked using                       graphics techniques in many cases, 2) massive computational                     resources for the numerical solution, and 3) extensive graphics                 output capability to represent results in a manner convenient for               interpretation, evaluation, and presentation.  Without the                      proposed graphic workstation capability, this type of advanced                  electromagnetics research cannot be easily pursued at the                       University.  Efficient access to appropriate computational                      resources is also necessary.",
