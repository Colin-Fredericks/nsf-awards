 "awd_abstract_narration": "Low frequency oscillations (LFO) of the atmosphere, a                      phenomenon with one-to two-month time scales, have captured the                 interest of researchers worldwide.  Much work has been                          concentrated on the tropics where the effects were initially                    discovered.  This research project will focus on higher latitudes               and, in particular, the stratosphere where this group has been                  the first to study LFO.  The research has four components:                           1) Global correlation maps similar to those obtained with                  MSU microwave analyses (90 mb temperatures) will be calculated                  for infrared SSU data in the middle and upper stratosphere.                          2) LFO vertical structure and propagation from the                         troposphere to the upper stratosphere will be studied with                      coherencies (in- and out-of phase correlations by wavenumber)                   using geopotential height fields and SSU data.  Lag-correlation                 Hovmoller studies will be used to investigate wavepacket                        behavior.  Tropics-higher latitude connections will be assessed                 with correlations between tropical microwave data and higher                    latitude/altitude geopotential height and SSU fields.                                3) LFO energy propagation and effect on the mean flow will                 be investigated with Eliassen-Palm flux divergence calculations.                An E-vector formulation will be used in regions of strong basic                 flow zonal asymmetry.  Comparison will be made with model                       predictions.                                                                         4) Recently reprocessed mesospheric radiance data fields                   will be used at Oxford University to search for the existence of                LFO above the stratopause.                                                           This research is important because it seeks relationships                  between processes in the high atmosphere and climate as                         manifested near the surface of the earth.  Such relationships                   should enhance our understanding of climate and our ability to                  predict its variations.",
