 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfields of mass spectrometery and gas                    chromatography.  Of the methods available for the trace analysis                of environmentally or biomedically important organic compounds,                 those based on high pressure, gas phase, electron capture                       reactions in combination with capillary column gas chromatography               have been shown to possess superior potential.  Two such methods                incorporate the High Pressure Electron Capture Mass Spectrometer                (HPECMS) and the Electron Capture Detector (ECD).  During the                   course of this project, Professor Grimsrud and his students will                further develop techniques which utilize the HPECMS and the ECD                 and will elaborate the underlying principles on which they                      depend.                                                                                                                                                         In spite of its great potential for trace chemical analysis, the                fundamental basis of \"Electron Capture Spectra\" observed by                     HPECMS is often not explicable in terms of electron capture                     processes, alone, because of poorly understood secondary                        processes.  One goal of this project is to improve the analytical               utility of HPECMS by revealing the existence and nature of such                 secondary processes and by determining the means by which their                 detrimental effects on analysis can be eliminated and their                     beneficial effects enhanced.  To this end, a specialized pulsed                 electron beam mass spectrometer will be constructed which will                  allow greater control and variation of experimental parameters                  than is possible with conventional, commercial instruments.                     Also, this research will extend the capability of the ECD through               the use of photon-induced electron detachments of negative ions                 within this device.",
