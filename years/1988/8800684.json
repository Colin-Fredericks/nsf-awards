 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study addresses the trophic position and productivity                 role of chlorophyll retaining ciliates in the ocean.  In order to               understand the trophic position of planktonic oligotrichous                     ciliates, factors that determine the ciliates' dependence on both               photosynthetic and phagotrophic modes of nutrition will be                      studied in a limited number of laboratory experiments.  The major               focus will be on documenting the incidence of chloroplast                       retention among ciliates in shelf, slope, and oceanic waters, and               compare it to existing data on its incidence in neritic waters.                 Productivity studies based on radiolabeled carbon will be used to               estimate the contribution of planktonic ciliates to primary                     production.                                                                          Ciliates are a type of protozoan that are common in aquatic                habitats.  They are considered to be part of the surface water                  fauna and to derive their food requirements from consuming other                planktonic organisms.  However, previous work by Stoecker has                   shown that about 40% of the oligotrichous ciliates in coastal                   waters retain chloroplasts derived from ingested algae.  Many of                these ciliates therefore, derive their nutrition from both                      photosynthesis (from the retained algal chloroplasts), as well as               from particle ingestion, and blur the usual distinction between                 plant and animal nutrition.  This work will investigate the                     factors that control the relative contributions of these two                    feeding modes to the nutrition of the ciliate, and determine how                extensive this unconventional feeding mode is in other parts of                 the ocean.",
