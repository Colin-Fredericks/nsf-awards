 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cytoplasmic microtubules are filamentous, sub-cellar organelles that            participate in a variety of important functions in eukaryotic                   organisms.  They play critical roles in cell division, in nerve growth          and regeneration, in cell shape determination, in the processes of              cytoplasmic transport, and in protein and hormone secretions.  Thus, an         understanding of the mechanism and regulation of microtubule assembly           may lead to new theraputic regimens for the treatment of cancer,                central nervous injury, and other diseases.  Study of the abundant              cold-stable microtubules present in the tissues of Antarctic fish should        lead to a greater understanding of the mechanism and regulation of              microtubule assembly in both cold-blooded and warm-blooded organisms.           The long range goal of Detrich's research is defining the adaptations           that are responsible for the assembly of stability and function of              cold-stable microtubule proteins.  The specific objectives of the               present award are four-fold:  1) Determining the structural domains of          antarctic fish tubulins that are necessary for microtubule assembly at          low temperature.  2) Characterizing the structural domains of tubulins          and microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) that are involved in the             MAP - enhanced assembly of cold-stable microtubules.  3) Sequencing             portions of the Alpha and Beta tubulins that are essential for                  microtubule assembly at low temperatures.  4) Cloning and sequencing            tubulin genes from an antarctic fish.  Research will be done mainly on          two antarctic cods, Notothenia gibberifrons and N. corricepts                   neglecta, and an ice fish, Chaenocephalus aceratus.  Field work will            be done at Palmer Station.",
