 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Girls Clubs of America (GCA) plans to develop over a three                  year period informal science learning activities to increase the                participation of women aged 14-18 in mathematics and science.  These            materials are part of an overall program, \"Operation SMART,\" that               is a major national commitment by the Girls Clubs of America to include         science and mathematics education as a major component of GCA activities        at all age levels.  Prior projects have developed and implemented               successful materials directed at elementary and middle school girls; the        present project extends this effort into the critically important high          school age years.                                                                                                                                               The materials will be developed by project staff in association with            developers at the Educational Development Center (EDC), piloted and             tested in four Girls Clubs sites along with training chapters                   nationwide.  A publisher will be identified for national distribution           and sales of activity materials sets and a book-length publication              designed for use by education programs of other youth-serving                   organizations.                                                                                                                                                  A partnership with the Business and Professional Women's Association            (BPW/USA) and its 3400 local chapters and with the AAAS Linkages Project        will create many non-Girls Club sites.  Dissemination to other youth-           serving organizations will be carried out through the National                  Collaboration for Youth.  As a result, Operation SMART's high school age        materials should reach several hundred thousand young women.                    Foundations and businesses will provide substantial additional project          support;  approximately 51% of the total $ l.4 million project budget is        requested from NSF.",
