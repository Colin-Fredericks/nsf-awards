 "awd_abstract_narration": "A transect of rainforest on Costa Rica's eastern slope                     extends from near sea level on the Atlantic coastal plain to                    2,600 m in the volcanic peaks of the Central Cordillera.  This                  land corridor constitutes the last intact tract of primary                      rainforest spanning such elevational extremes left on Central                   America's Atlantic Slope, providing an unparalleled site for the                investigation of pristine tropical streams.  Previous studies                   suggest that phosphorus-rich streams draining swamp forest at the               lower end of this continuum are important sites of nitrogen                     transformation via microbial denitrification.  Micronutrient                    limitation of algal growth has also been demonstrated.                                  This study focuses on factors controlling algal production              and nitrogen transformations in a lowland swamp forest stream.                  It will advance our understanding of biogeochemical cycles in the               Central American tropics and the numerous factors affecting algal               primary production.  Major objectives are:  (1) to measure                      seasonal variation in nutrient levels and diurnal variations in                 nutrient flux in selected stream reaches located within, above                  and below swamp forest; (2) to examine effects of nutrient                      additions, light and fish grazing on algal growth and primary                   production under different nutrient regimes above and below swamp               forest; and (3) to measure seasonal fluctuations in denitrifying                potentials of stream sediments under endogenous and nutrient-                   enriched conditions, within, above, and below swamp forest.",
