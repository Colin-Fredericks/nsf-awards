 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is a direct continuation of an ongoing, NSF           supported project, using the larvae of Haliotis rufescens (gastropod            mollusc) as a model for experimental analysis of the mechanisms by which        cells and organisms recognize and transduce exogenous chemical signals.         With previous support it has been determined that these larvae require          the receptor-mediated recognition of an exogenous GABA-mimetic                  oligopeptide (or GABA analogs) to induce metamorphosis; that the                receptors (R1) involved in this signal-recognition are located on cilia         that can be conveniently purified in quantities sufficient for                  biochemical analyses; that these receptors are subject to a ligand-             induced down-regulation; and that the receptor-mediated signal is               transduced by a cascade involving adenyl cyclase, activation of a               protein kinase, and the opening of membrane channels for chloride ions.         It has also been found that responsiveness to R1 receptor activation can        be amplified 1,000-fold by a second group of signal molecules (diamino          acids) that bind to independent receptors (R2) also present on the              purified cilia.  This signal amplification that results from R2 receptor        binding is transduced by a separate pathway involving a G protein,              phospholipase, diacylglycerol and a separate protein kinase.  The next          objectives of this study are to characterize further the cellular and           molecular mechanisms of action of the signal receptors, transducers, and        the amplifier described above.  Specifically, it is proposed to:  (1)           purify (by affinity-techniques) the R1 and R2 receptors, the receptor-          bearing cells and/or cilia, and the essential signal transduction               components (including the targets of protein phosphorylation) of both           the morphogenetic and amplifier pathways; (2) analyze the mechanisms of         R1 and R2 receptor interaction with, and responses to, the cognate              signal molecules in vitro; (3) resolve, reconstitute, and analyze in            vitro the receptors and signal transduction elements essential for the          function of both pathways, to determine their mechanisms of action at           the molecular level; and (4) determine the molecular mechanism and the          cellular level of interaction (i.e., signal amplification) of the               morphogenetic and amplifier pathways, through analyses to be performed          both in vitro and in vivo.                                                                                                                                           This research will provide the most complete picture yet available         of the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which chemical signals from         the environment are recognized and transduced, and the mechanisms by            which these processes are regulated, to contol the metamorphosis of             marine invertebrate larvae.  The results of these investigations also           will provide new, basic information on the mechanisms of action and             evolution of chemical signal receptors and their associated signal              transducers and regulatory pathways, as well as the mechanisms by which         these control physiological and behavioral processes, and responsiveness        to stimuli.  This information should be applicable to a wide variety of         hormonal and other signal- and receptor-dependent systems.",
