 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's of this proposal have recently demonstrated a record, room             temperature optical nonlinearity with picosecond response time in               mercury telluride.  They propose to continue their study of nonlinear           optical processes in semiconductor, with the specific goal of                   achieving even larger and faster optical nonlinearities for                     applications such as signal processing and far infrared generation.             Their effort will combine theory and experiment.  The experiments will          involve nonlinear optical mixing with carbon dioxide lasers.  The               following projects are proposed:                                                                                                                                     1.   Study the effect of band structure tailoring in                                 superlattices.  Our theories have shown that electronic                         processes in superlattices can exhibit large nonlinear                          optical effects.                                                                                                                                           2.   Explore hybrid optical electrical processes, especially                         effects near the thresholds of the Gunn instability an                          impact ionization.  An initial experiment has demonstrated                      optically triggered flip-flop in germanium.                                                                                                                3.   Continue our work on zerogap semiconductors, including far                      infrared generation and optimization of the large optical                       nonlinearity.                                                                                                                                              4.   Continue studies of nonlinear optical effects due to                            impurity levels in semiconductors.                                                                                                                         5.   Use nonlinear optical methods to characterize superlattice                      structures.  Specifically, the characteristic relaxation                        mechanisms of superlattices will be probed by four-wave                         mixing experiments.",
