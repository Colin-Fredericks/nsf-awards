 "awd_abstract_narration": "This department is using the present award to procure the                  equipment needed for teaching of modern nucleic acid research,                  providing students an opportunity to explore such modern research               techniques as recombinant DNA technology and protein analysis.  DNA             electrophoresis and protein gel electrophoresis units along with such           supportive equipment needed in work with recombinant DNA as a micro-            centrifuge, micropipetters, a UV transilluminator, speed vac, vacuum            oven, shaker incubator, sonicator, and cold cabinet are being used by           students in a new course, Molecular Genetics, as well as in two already         established core courses.                                                                                                                                            Students learn protein chemistry, DNA structure, RNA expression,           and other protocols used in recombinant DNA technology.  In a five-year         period about 250 undergraduates involved in an average of three to four         courses per student will have extensive hands-on experience with this           equipment.                                                                                                                                                           This project is one result of the university's positive steps              toward providing its students with classes in the rapidly expanding             field of genetic engineering and recombinant DNA technology.  A biology         faculty member with expertise in these fields, hired in 1987, is                designing the new Molecular Genetics course.  The grantee institution           is matching the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal           sources.",
