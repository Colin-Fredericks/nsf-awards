 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object of this research is to develop permanent magnet                 motors having significantly higher torque capability than the state-            of-the-art through the use of air-gap winding armatures and advanced            cooling techniques.  According to preliminary studies, the air-gap              winding motor has a performance factor more than twice as high as               conventional permanent magnet motors, two to three times as much                torque capacity as equivalently cooled conventional motors, and                 shorter mechanical and electrical time constants.  These high torque            and rapid response capabilities would enable such motors to compete             with electrohydraulic actuators as lower cost, faster response,                 direct actuators for robotic and control applications.  These                   characteristics, as well as high thermal capacity, suggest their                application as machine-tool servo motors.  The object of the Phase I            research is to further develop the electromagnetic, thermal, and                mechanical models of the air-gap winding motor, and to prepare a                detail design for a prototype air-gap winding motor.",
