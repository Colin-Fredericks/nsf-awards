 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many hemoproteins, ranging from oxygen-carriers and electron-                   carries to heme enzymes, utilize protoheme as their                             prosthetic group.  Since the primary and three-dimensional                      structures have been determined for a number of                                 representative hemoproteins, it becomes feasible to analyze                     and rationally predict a correlation between the molecular                      structure and biochemical functions.  Cytochrome c peroxidase                   (CCP) was the first heme enzyme whose crystal structure was                     determined.  This allows a direct structural comparision of a                   heme enzyme with well established hemoproteins such as                          myoglobin, hemoglobin and the cytochromes to examine the                        structural basis for their functional diversity.                                                                                                                Dr. Yonetani will investigate the spectroscopic, kinetic and                    enzymic properties of native and metal-substituted cytochrome                   c peroxidases and their interaction with cytochrome c.  He is                   especially interested in probing the electronic and                             structural features of cytochrome peroxidase, particularly                      the prosthetic group and its environment, that can be                           correlated with the unique reactivity of the enzyme with                        hydroperoxides.  This should further the understanding of the                   mechanism of electron transfer between two hemoproteins.",
