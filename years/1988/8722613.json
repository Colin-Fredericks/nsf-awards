 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in solid state                   physics between Dr. Werner P. Wolf, Yale University and Dr. J.F.                Gregg, Clarendon Laboratory, Oxford University, U.K.  Ultrasonic                waves have long been used to study magnetoelastic properties.  By               measuring the transit time of a short pulse, one obtains                        information about changes of length resulting from magnetostrictive             effects, and also about changes of elastic moduli corresponding to              changes in the magnetic state of the material.  Recent developments             of high frequency ultrasonic transducers, using sputtered ZnO                   films, have made possible magnetoacoustic studies at gigahertz                  frequencies.  A group at Oxford University led by Dr. Gregg has                 developed a cryogenic system for such experiments and is currently              using it to study magnetic phase transitions in rare earth                      insulators.  A group at Yale under Dr. Wolf has long experience                 with rare earth insulators and with phase transitions.  It is                   proposed to enter into a collaborative arrangement in which                     experiments done at Oxford will be analyzed at Yale.  Also, a                   number of collaborative experiments will be carried out jointly at              Oxford.                                                                                                                                                         The work will concentrate on magnetic systems in which a number of              basic phenomena can be studied.  These include transformations                  between time reversed antiferromagnetic states, involving                       metastability, nucleation and domain growth, and other order-order              and order-disorder phase transitions.  Unexplained effects                      previously observed in magnetoelectric experiments may also be                  resolved.  Further developments of microwave ultrasonic techniques              may be expected, and these could have important applications to                 devices involving four-wave mixing and phase conjugation.",
