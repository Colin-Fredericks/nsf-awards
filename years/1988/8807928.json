 "awd_abstract_narration": "A workshop on Research Issues in Software Engineering is to be                  organized. Approximately 25 persons representing academia, industry and         government will be invited.  There are at least three foci of the               workshop.  First the workshop attendees will need to identify the major         research issues in Software Engineering.  The workshop would                    concentrate on topics which represent activities that can be carried            out under NSF programs, i.e., research in an academic setting, but not          excluding industrial participation.                                                                                                                             The second focus will be on appropriate research paradigms.  Software           Engineering is a broad subject and no single paradigm will always be            appropriate.  The workshop will attempt to identify approaches to the           topics of research.  This means context as well methodology, i.e., is           the research best carried out by a single investigator, by teams, by            consortia, or by academic-industrial paternerships.   Issues of scale           will be also be considered.                                                                                                                                     The workshop also consider questions related to funding levels and              related issues.  The workshop will produce a comprehensive document             that addresses the issues and the proposed courses of action, provide           and assessment of the national needs vis-a-vis their impact on Software         Engineering research, and the perceived priorities on these issues.//",
