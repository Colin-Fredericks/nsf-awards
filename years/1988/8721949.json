 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project         between Dr. Marion Baumgardner of Purdue University and Dr. George              Varallyay of the Hungarian Research Institute of Soil Science and               Agricultural Chemistry is to study the spectral reflectance of soils in         two distinctly different pedogenic environments, one in the California          Valley and one in the Carpathian Basin.  Two hypotheses will be                 tested:  1) Variations in reflectance of salt-affected soils is related         to the quantity and quality of soluble salts present, organic                   constituents and their interaction; and 2) these relationships will be          different for soils from different environments.  Methods will                  emphasize the monitoring of change and development of prediction                models.  Results should contribute to our ability to track global               changes related to potential soil productivity and environmental                quality.                                                                                                                                                        This project in earth sciences fulfills the program objectives of               advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States         and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and share research          resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
