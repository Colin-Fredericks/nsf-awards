 "awd_abstract_narration": "This one-year project, which contains strong components in both                 mathematics content and methodology, will facilitate the use of                 computers in middle and high school classrooms.  Under the direction of         the Principal Investigator, ten superior secondary school mathematics           teachers will provide an inservice training program to sixty middle and         high school mathematics teachers from Utah, southern Idaho, and western         Wyoming.  During an intensive two-week summer session, these ten                teacher-leaders will offer a total of five courses in the structure of          the number system, geometry, algebra, probability and statistics, and           discrete mathematics.  These courses will combine instruction in                mathematics content with preparation in the use of materials that employ        the microcomputer as a teaching tool.  During the academic year, the            participants will be visited by the PI and will communicate with each           other via an existing computer network that contains hundreds of                computer-based classroom activities.                                                                                                                            The project will demonstrate a cost-effective method of conducting              inservice programs through the use of teacher-leaders as instructors.           The participants' schools will provide computers, modems, and other             support for the computer network, and Weber State College will                  contribute an amount equal to 10% of the NSF award.",
