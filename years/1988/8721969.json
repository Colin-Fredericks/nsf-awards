 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Bruce Ault is supported by a grant from The                        Physical Chemistry Program to investigate intermediates of                      chemical reactions which have been trapped in a matrix of solid                 Argon. Some of these studies may further our understanding of                   the chemical vapor deposition process used for making                           semiconductor devices.                                                                                                                                             Ault will exploit the unique capabilities of matrix                          isolation to study several classes of reactive intermediates.                   A significant portion of the effort will be directed toward the                 development of excimer laser multiphoton ionization as a                        photochemical means of generating reactive intermediates,                       including radical fragments, novel rearrangement products, and                  ions.  Two important classes of molecular complexes will also                   be characterized after formation through twin jet deposition.                   The first class consists of complexes between crown ethers and                  certain cations and neutral acids.  The second class consists                   of intermediate complexes of group III and V elements which are                 thought to play a major role in the chemical vapor deposition                   of semiconductor films.  Spectroscopic characterization of                      these complexes will lead to a better understanding of                          molecular interactions and the role of intermediate complexes                   in chemical processes.",
