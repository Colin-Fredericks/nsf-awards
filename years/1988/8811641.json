 "awd_abstract_narration": "The prime objective of this research is to design, fabricate, and test          an actuator for an artificial human hand.  Current artificial hands             have attempted to provide the required dexterity, however, the current          actuator systems employed are extremely limited and yield subpar                performance.  The key to creating effective artificial hands is a               light weight actuator.                                                          Actuators made from piezoelectric materials will be used to resolve             many of the problems of current systems.  These materials are light             and compact, and the piezoelectric actuator can be placed at the joint          thereby eliminating some important problems while producing better              control of the hand.                                                            A number of alternative designs for a piezoelectric actuator will be            developed.  Analytical models will be developed for each design and an          optimum design will be sought using the gradient search optimazation            technique.  Experiments will compare the performance of artificial              hand and the human hand.  Response time, dexterity, compliance and              controlability are characteristics that will be analyzed.  Issues               concerning the capability of groups of piezoelectric actuators to               function together and to handle reasonable payloads will be addressed.",
