 "awd_abstract_narration": "Providing parental care to offspring is the usual mode                     ofnurturing in birds.  However, in a variety of species, some                   females lay eggs in the nests of other individuals of their own                 species, which then rear the offspring.  There is increasing                    evidence that this intraspecific brood parasitism is a                          widespread phenomenon in birds.  However, the adaptive                          significance of this behavior remains unclear.  For almost all of               the seventy odd species where intraspecific brood parasitism been               documented, the identity of the parasitic females, or what they                 gain by laying eggs in the nests of other females, is unknown.                       The widespread occurrence of intraspecific brood parasitism                raises some fundamental questions about the costs and benefits of               providing parental care to offspring in particular, and about the               optimization of life history strategies in general.                             Tounderstand the ecological and evolutionary significance                       ofintraspecific brood parasitism in birds, a population of                      American coots in central British Columbia will be studied.                     Brood parasitism is common in this population and nearly a                      quarter of all nests were parasitized in 1987.  Research to date                has revealed that most parasitic females are territorial birds                  with nests of their own.  Thus, parasitic females can be trapped                at their own nests, individually marked, and their laying                       histories can be followed across years.  The costs and benefits                 of brood parasitism to these parasitic females, and the                         behavioral, demographic and ecological factors associated with                  the behavior will be examined.  Detailed studies like this are                  necessary if the broad patterns of intraspecific parasitism are                 to be understood.",
