 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cornell Theory Center, including the Cornell National                       Supercomputing Facility, proposes to conduct a two-week Supercomputer           Summer Institute for 25 young researchers.  The Institute will focus            on numerical techniques to exploit vector and parallel processing               through lectures and hands-on workshop sessions.                                                                                                                Attendees will bring with them their own computer codes which will be           used as the vehicle for training and education in optimization.  Each           attendee will be given 10 computer service units which can be used              after the Institute is over.                                                                                                                                    The Cornell Institute will be held directly following a regular one-            week session of the Cornell Remote User Training Workshop.  The                 workshop will insure a good grasp of the mechanics of using the                 Cornell facilities, and will take advantage of course material which            has been tested in previous sessions.                                                                                                                           The original proposal request funding in the amount of $55,951.                 Negotiation has succeeded in reducing the cost while maintaining most           of the original scope of work.  An award is recommended in the amount           of $30,000.",
