 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is based on an object-oriented                       semantic association model, which has been used in a prototype                  development of a distributed data administration system for                     supporting the integrated manufacturing facility of the National                Bureau of Standards.  This research aims to extend the model to                 allow user-defined operations and knowledge rules, which model                  integrity and security constraints, deductive rules, and domain                 specific expert rules, to be defined in object classes and                      instances.  Thus, knowledge rules associated with objects are                   integrated with their data so that rules are readily available                  when associated data are being processed.                                            A high-level object-oriented knowledge manipulation language               will be developed.  It allows the user to specify complex                       semantic patterns as search contexts and to concentrate on the                  objects of their interest without having to explicitly specify                  the traversal paths in queries.  A mechanism for applying                       relevant rule-based knowledge while processing a transaction in a               match-modify-execute cycle is proposed.  The proposed functional                integration of database and reasoning components allows tailoring               of techniques such as query optimization, transaction management,               integrity and security control, and concurrency control for use                 in the knowledge base management system environment.",
