 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project 2061: Education for a Changing Future is a long-term effort by          the AAAS to contribute in a significant way to the reform of K-12               education in science, mathematics and technology. Phase I of Project            2061 recommends the fundamental knowledge, skills and habits of mind            that all students should possess by the time they leave secondary               school.                                                                                                                                                         In this project, which is Phase II of Project 2061, the teacher                 enhancement component will address the broad content preparation of 125         school educators, 100 teachers and  25 administrators. These                    participant-teams will be selected from five school districts around the        country focussing on the provision of leadership for reforming the K-12         curriculum as it bears on science, mathematics and technology. School           districts, state educational facilities and universities will                   participate in this collaborative project.                                                                                                                      The goals of the project are to (1) improve teachers' ability to teach          science, (2) have significant input into the design of curriculum models        and (3) provide leadership for the reform of K-12 science, mathematics          and technology education.                                                                                                                                       In addition to this grant, an amount equivalent to at least 75%                 of the requested NSF budget is being contributed by other                       sources, principally, the Carnegie Corporation which funded all                 of Phase I of Project 2061.",
