 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal consists of different sections corresponding to                   different research areas in which x-ray diffraction is used to                  investigate basic problems of solid state physics.  They propose                perform a laser annealing study of silicon, and observe the                     disappearance of Bragg reflection during melting using a grazing                incidence technique in conjunction with time resolved counting.                 This work is actually in progress.  They also hope to determine                 the radial distribution function of the liquid phase, and to                    observe the photostriction effect, a lattice contraction during                 laser illumination due to high density of electron-hole pairs.                  The mechanisms of sliding Charge Density Waves (CDW's) in a blue                bronze crystal will be investigated using a Mossbauer diffraction               technique.  An experimental investigation on the properties of                  crystalline Helium is also proposed.  Diffraction studies of the                electron density of He in the solid state will be carried out,                  and structural defects will be investigated by means of white                   beam topography using a synchrotron radiation beam. A project on                use of multiple Bragg scattering for solving the phase problem in               diffraction, supported by a previous NSF grant, has been brought                to completion.  Since it represents a major breakthrough in                     diffraction physics, a full report is given in one section of                   this proposal.",
