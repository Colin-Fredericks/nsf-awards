 "awd_abstract_narration": "A proof of concept will be established (in Phase 1), and (in                    Phase II) a cost-effective portable computer-based system will be               developed for acquisition and processing of data needed to create,              on-site if desired, as-built drawings of facilities such as buildings           and space layouts.  Robust algorithms for checking the measurements             given and user interface graphics will give the needed reliability              for eventual commercial application.  The core of the system will be            based on a high-performance 32-bit single-board computer readily                available.                                                                      The computer will be supplemented with convenient commercially                  available transducers for measurement of distances, orientations and            specific reference locations.  Various options exist for these                  sensors; a number of particular approaches are discussed, such as an            ultrasonic transmitter-receiver, theodolite-type systems with direct            electronic readout of angles and distance, and laser-based systems.             An overall system with reliable data-acquisition from sensors, real-            time processing, analysis and graphical display of the physical                 location, will be designed to the prototype level in Phase I.",
