 "awd_abstract_narration": "A workshop on the role of fluids in sediment accretion,                 deformation, diagenesis and metamorphism at subduction zones will               be held in October 1988 at Il Ciocco, Italy.  The workshop will                 focus on (1) sea floor manifestations of fluid flow; (2) sources                and evolution of fluids; (3) geometry of flow and physical                      properties; and (4) the effects of fluids on tectonics in                       sedimentary accretionary prisms.  A major objective of the                      workshop is to develop scientific plans for an international                    program of cooperative research on the subject.  Participants to                the workshop will be invited experts, recommended by the                        organizing committee.                                                           %%%                                                                                     The problem of fluid flow in accretionary sediment                      environments is a subject of intense study by earth scientists                  today.  These environments occur at a number of places around the               world, in a variety of settings.  The material in accretionary                  prisms is incorporated into continental rocks and not much is                   known about this process, nor about the role of water in                        deformation and metamorphosis of them.  International                           coordination and cooperation are needed to develop the tools,                   facilities and ideas to study these problem efficiently and                     effectively.  This workshop will help these planning and                        coordination efforts.",
