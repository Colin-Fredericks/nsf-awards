 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this research is to enhance the similitude of             steel structures which can be attained using small-scale models.  A             second objective is to reduce the cost of small-scale model                     construction.  To attain these objectives a series of tests on beams,           columns, shear links, and an eccentrically braced frame constructed             using specially manufactured small-scale wide-flange sections are               proposed.  Central to this project is a novel method of manufacturing           wide-flange sections from individual plates by welding in an                    extensive fixture.  This method, which has been found successful in a           small pilot study, results in straight sections with excellent                  dimensional accuracy.  In addition, the simulation of residual                  stresses similar to those found in prototype sections may be                    accomplished.  Successful completion of this project is expected to             enhance the use of small-scale models for testing novel structural              systems and refining existing ones.  Use of small-scale models will             enable researchers to test more complete structures in order to                 better determine appropriate design procedures and ensure that                  critical failure modes are not overlooked in analysis.",
