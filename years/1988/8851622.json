 "awd_abstract_narration": "The utilization of major instrumentation to solve chemical problems is          usually reserved for a course in instrumental analysis given in the             third year of an American Chemical Society approved degree program.             With increasing numbers of students opting for non-ACS approved                 chemistry degrees, fewer students are completing a chemistry sequence           that includes instrumental analysis.  Yet, it is important that today's         students be familiar with state-of-the-art technologies and their               capabilities in the arena of chemical analysis.  A program to                   incorporate a graded introduction to instrumentation through  a)                demonstrations for freshmen and non-science major courses, b) use of            such equipment for structural analysis and purity determinations for            organic chemistry courses, c) understanding of the instrumental design          in instrumental analysis, and d) incorporation as a resource tool in            Senior Research projects is being introduced.  The program is being             developed around the three major spectroscopic techniques - nuclear             magnetic resonance spectroscopy,  Fourier transform infrared                    spectroscopy and mass spectrometry.   The purchase of the mass                  spectrometer is completing the integrated spectroscopy program.                                                                                                 The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.",
