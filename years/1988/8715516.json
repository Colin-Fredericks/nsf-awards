 "awd_abstract_narration": "The destruction of hazardous liquid wastes by means of                          incineration is a viable technique that requires careful                        monitoring of emissions and combustion efficiency.  Modeling                    efforts in the past have been limited by the absence of                         fundamental information on the heat, momentum, and mass                         transfer mechanisms controlling the heating, vaporization,                      mixing, and combustion of the liquid-waste sprays encountered in                real systems.  This research effort concentrates on the                         fundamental processes governing the energy, mass and momentum                   exchanges between the liquid- and gas-phases, as well as on the                 chemical reactions involved in the destruction of hazardous                     liquid wastes.  Two distinct geometries are investigated:  one                  consisting of parallel streams of droplets in a channel flow, and               another consisting of a swirl-stabilized centerbody reactor.  A                 number of aspects controlling the efficient destruction of                      hazardous liquid wastes are examined, such as the effects of                    droplet size distribution, multi-component (fuel-doped) liquid-                 waste streams, secondary atomization, reactor geometry, efficient               flame propagation, and turbulence, among others.                                                                                                                The current lack of information has resulted in overly                          conservative and economically unattractive designs.  The results                of this program will be useful in the design of more efficient,                 safer, and economic liquid-waste incinerators.",
