 "awd_abstract_narration": "New generations of flexible manufacturing/assembly/disassembly                  systems feature a complex interaction of many entities.  There are              several machines, some flexible, and several part-types which require           attention at many machines, in a prespecified order.  Set up times              are involved in switching from a production run of one part-type to             another at a machine.  Parts also incur transportation delays when              moving from machine to machine.  Desired production levels are set              for the various part-types, and the system is governed by parameters            such as the processing time for a part at a machine.  There are also            the vagaries of uncertainty due to yield, quality control and machine           failures.                                                                                                                                                       How do we schedule the operation of such systems, so as to                      efficiently carry out the desired production?  In the proposed                  research, the PI shows the beginnings of a theoretical foundation for           developing scheduling algorithms which perform efficiently in real              time.  These algorithms can be implemented in a distributed fashion,            and are stable in the sense that backlogs of parts at the machine are           kept under control.  The ingredients of his approach are to study the           dynamics of such systems and use feedback and closed-loop regulation            to control scheduling.",
