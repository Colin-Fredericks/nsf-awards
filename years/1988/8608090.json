 "awd_abstract_narration": "Elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, and rays) are a group of primitive               fishes which synthesize and retain in their tissues high levels                 of urea for the purpose of counteracting the high salt                          concentration of seawater.  Our studies have shown that the                     pathway for urea synthesis in sharks is uniquely different from                 the urea cycle in mammalian species, which excrete nitrogen waste               products as urea.  Other significant differences in related                     metabolic pathways have also been discovered.  The purpose of                   this study is to 1) characterize these unique properties and                    relate the results to the adaptive metabolic strategies of                      elasmobranchs and osmoregulation and 2) relate these unique                     metabolic properties of the sharks.  The results will contribute                to understanding of metabolic adaptation and evolution, and of                  the significance of the different pathway for urea synthesis                    relative to regulation of osmolarity in a seawater environment.",
