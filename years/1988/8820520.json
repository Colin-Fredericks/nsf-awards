 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this research is to explore new techniques to             aid in the interpretation of results generated by structural analysis           programs.  Emphasis will be placed on results generated by earthquake           analysis of building structures.  The techniques developed will be              tested with the results generated by the three-dimensional computer             analysis program ETABS.  Previous research lead to the development of           a new interactive graphical interface for the ETABS program.  The               techniques developed in this research are applicable to other                   structural analysis programs as well.                                                                                                                           Earthquake structural analysis of a building structure typically                generates a vast quantity of information that requires careful                  evaluation for it to be useful in design.  Information such as natural          frequencies, mode shapes, maximum response quantities, and story                drifts are generated and saved in results files.  The research will             focus on new techniques to simplify the interpretation and evaluation           of this data.  The primary goal of these techniques is to make the 3-           dimensional earthquake structural analysis of building structures a             practical design tool.",
