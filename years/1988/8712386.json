 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this research is to obtain a better                    understanding  of tribopolymerization--the planned or intentional               formation of polymeric films directly on rubbing surfaces--as a                 mechanism of boundary lubrication, with special emphasis on the role            of surface temperatures on the process.  The behavior of selected               monomers capable of forming surface polymers under tribological                 contact by polycondensation as well as addition reactions will be               investigated in a research program which couples the following                  experimental systems or techniques:  (a) an advanced rotating                   sapphire disk/infrared microscope device to determine surface                   temperatures produced by friction; (b) surface analytical techniques-           -including Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy--to study the                characteristics of thin polymer surface films formed; and (c) other             methods which couple thermal effects with surface reactions and                 polymerization.                                                                 The significance of this research is that it represents a rational              and innovative approach to the design of chemical structures to act             as boundary lubricants to reduce wear and surface damage in                     tribological processes.  Unlike conventional antiwear additives which           chemically react with the solid surface (e.g., iron) to from a                  protective layer, this approach involves the deposition of a surface            film which acts to reduce adhesion,                                             wear, and damage.  The principal investigators believe that a                   better understanding of the tribopolymerization process--                       including the role of surface temperature, catalysis, and                       electron emission in tribological contact--will open the door to                new, extremely effective, and unconventional approaches to                      minimizing wear in a wide variety of systems.  This should make                 it possible to design specific antiwear additives for given                     tribological systems.",
