 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Scholastic, Inc. Project, Super Science:  A Mass Media Program, will        launch two classroom science magazines, one for grades 1 - 3, another           for grades 4 - 6, with a companion series of computer disks materials.          They will stress hands-on and inquiry activities that mix science with          reading, math and social studies.  The science and technology skills and        know-how that students will need as consumers, workers, and citizens            will be an important aspect in the development of the project.  The             student magazines will have teachers guides and a special periodical for        early grade teachers.                                                                                                                                           Project staff will use a three-part project team support effort to              develop Super Science.  First, a panel of leaders in science education          will serve as advisors and consultants to ensure the pedagogical                soundness; second, administrators and teachers in nine ethnically               diverse districts nationwide will help formulate the scope and sequence         plan for the magazines and software and will test for class                     practicality, third, The Triangle Goalition for science and Technology          Education will help search out practicing scientists to serve as                consultants to assure the scientific validity of the materials.                                                                                                 Scholastic Inc. was founded in 1920 with a single publication.  The             company now publishes 29 classroom magazines for students and 5                 professional magazines for teachers and/or supervisors as well as               textbooks, paperbacks for students and classroom software.  The                 publishers will invest in excess of $5.2 million during the 4 years             development phase and will continue the activities in subsequent years.                                                                                         This proposal was submitted in response to the Program Solicitation,            \"Programs for Elementary School Science Instruction II,\" which                  encourages \"troika\" partnerships among publishers, school systems, and          scientists/science educators.",
