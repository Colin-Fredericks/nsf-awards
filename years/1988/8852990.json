 "awd_abstract_narration": "A quadropole mass spectrometer and associated computer hardware and             software for instrument control and data analysis is being acquired.            The instrumentation is being interfaced to an existing/packed column            gas chromatograph, giving gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and              interactive data acquisition analysis capabilities which were                   previously nonexistent in the department.  Students (both majors and            non-majors) are using the apparatus in fulfilling laboratory                    assignments in Organic Chemistry, Instrumental Analysis, and Physical           Chemistry courses.  The equipment is also being used extensively by             students in the required senior research program.  While the program            had previously integrated the chemistry subdisciplines within the               laboratory program attached to individual courses, especially                   Instrumental Analysis, this is the first the vertical integration has           been accomplished.  The progressively challenging and instructive               hands-on exercises centered around the modern GC/MS is the cornerstone          of the program.                                                                                                                                                 The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.",
