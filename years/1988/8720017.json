 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is the continuation of a very productive                     program under Professor H. L. Tuller at the Massachusetts                       Institute of Technology.  Under the prior support by the National               Science Foundation, Professor Tuller and his colleagues published               more than eighteen significant papers in scientific journals on                 topics such as mixed electrical conduction in nonstoichiometric                 oxides, electronic structure of grain boundaries  and interfaces                in polycrystalline zinc oxide, defects and charge transport in                  stabilized tantalum oxide, electrical and optical properties of                 magnesia and alumina, thermodynamics and transport properties in                mixed cerium and uranium oxides, and metal oxide sensors.  The                  current research will emphasize defect formation, interaction,                  and transport in nonstoichiometric metal oxides in both single                  and polycrystalline forms.  The program will include both                       experimental and theoretical efforts.  Electrically-active                      ceramic interfaces (which form the basis of a variety of advanced               electronic devices) will be studied with the goal of modifying                  and controlling the chemistry of these interfaces,                              characterization of their electronic transport properties, and                  interpreting the correlation between the two.  Oxygen defect                    concentration as a function of depth from the surface will be                   determined with complex impedance techniques and through a unique               new method based upon photoelectrochemical etching.  Solid state                diffusional techniques will be used to establish the oxygen ion                 configuration as a function of composition.                                                                                                                          Electronic ceramics are technologically important to the                   semiconductor industry, the sensor industry, and for fuel cells,                catalysts, and high temperature batteries.  Understanding of the                defect structure and electrical charge transport is crucial to                  the performance of these materials.  Training of students to do                 research in this critical area is a key part of this research                   program.",
