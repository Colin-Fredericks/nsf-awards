 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II                         project is in the general area of analytical and surface                        chemistry and in the subfields of electrochemistry and                          materials chemistry.  The goal of this activity is to                           develop electrically conducting polymers synthesized from                       substituted pyrroles as materials for rechargeable battery                      electrodes and other applications.  In the preceding Phase                      I research, EIC Laboratories, Inc. demonstrated that a                          polypyrrole (PP) copolymer could be synthesized that                            contained quinone pendant groups which are                                      electrochemically accessible via the PP backbone.  The                          company further demonstrated that in aqueous electrolytes,                      the presence of these quinone moieties enhanced the                             electrochemical capacity of the conducting polymer.                                                                                                             In the present Phase II activity, the previous Phase I work                     is being extended and broadened in scope.  Research tasks                       for the current effort include: (1) the development and                         optimization of new synthetic routes to substituted pyrrole                     monomers; (2) the synthesis and evaluation of new PP                            copolymers including optimization of the doping potential                       and doping level, characterization of the electronic                            conductivity of substituted PP films, investigation of the                      pH dependence of the pendant quinone moieties, and                              examination of the kinetics of electrocatalysis by these                        quinones; and (3) investigation of applications of                              derivatized polypyrroles in battery technology, sensor                          electrodes, catalysis, and conductivity redox polymers.                         The new materials derived from this research could enjoy                        broad, technologically important applications.",
