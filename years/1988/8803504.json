 "awd_abstract_narration": "Monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are the C10 and C15 members                     of the isoprenoid family of plant products.  Selective                          techniques for extraction of glandular trichomes and affinity                   chromatography methods allow purification of the enzymes of                     terpene metabolism in high yield.  This research tests a                        stereochemical model for the coupled isomerization-                             cyclization of geranyl pyrophosphate to symmetrical                             monoterpenes.  Stereospecifically labeled precursors,                           selective chemical degradation schemes and chromatographic                      resolution of enantiomers, permit the cryptic                                   stereochemistries of the reaction steps, and hydride-shift                      patterns, to be deciphered.  Four types of sesquiterpene                        cyclases are being used to compare the mechanism,                               stereochemistry and enzymology of sesquiterpene biosynthesis.                   Cytochrome P450-dependent hydroxylases catalyze the first                       step in the oxidative transformation of parent cyclic                           terpenoids; and several of these highly specific mixed-                         function oxidases have been isolated.  These microsomal                         systems will be solubilized and separated into components,                      and reconstitution experiments, kinetic analysis, and binding                   studies will be employed to establish the basis for the                         extreme substrate selectivity observed.  Potent, highly                         selective inhibitors of the hydroxylases will be designed                       which, along with a specific inhibitor of cyclization, will                     be used to manipulate terpene production in vivo.                               %%%                                                                             Many biological molecules and natural products are composed                     of a basic five-carbon building block.  Terpenes are the                        compounds made from this building block that impart                             fragrances to many plants making them useful as perfume,                        spices and attractants or repellants to insects.  This                          research will improve our understanding of terpene                              metabolism, aid in attempts to exploit ecological                               interactions involving terpenoids, and assist in efforts to                     improve production of these commercially valuable natural                       products.",
