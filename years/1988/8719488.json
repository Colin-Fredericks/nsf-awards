 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important aspect of normal neuromuscular development is the          matching of fast and slow motoneurons with appropriate muscle fiber             types, but the mechanisms responsible for this matching are presently           not understood.  Embryonic chick is a suitable system for the study of          this problem, as the tissues involved are easily manipulated.  The              time course of appropriate innervation will be determined during                embryonic development of chick hindlimb muscle.  This will determine            if specificity occurs with initial innervation, or if appropriate               matching is produced by a rearrangement of neuromuscular connections.           The molecular mechanisms involved in the matching of neurons to                 specific muscle fiber types will be investigated.  An in-vitro model            will be used to test the preference of fast or slow motoneurons for             outgrowth on substrates containing fast or slow myotube membrane                components.  Also, since antigenic differences between fast and slow            myotube membranes may be surface components that are recognized by              motoneurons during innervation, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies            will be raised against slow and fast muscle surface membrance                   components.  These antibodies can then be used to characterize                  molecular differences between fast and slow muscle, and to interfere            with the recognition process during development in ovo.  These studies          will provide a fuller understanding of the cellular and molecular               events during normal selective synaptogenesis.",
