 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to rapidly assign cloned murine sequences to their                  chromosomal location would greatly facilitate the correlation of                cloned sequences to the large number of genetic loci which have                 been identified in the mouse.  The methods currently available                  for mapping murine sequences, such as hybridization to DNA from                 mouse/hamster somatic cell hybrids, use of restriction fragment                 length polymorphisms in recombinant inbred strains of mice or                   hybridization in situ to murine chromosomes, are either not                     generally available or are too labor=intensive to be useful as                  general screening techniques.  Dr. Villa-Komaroff will                          immortalize lymphocytes from 19 strains of mice containing                      Robertsonian chromosomes using retroviruses containing the T                    antigen from SV40 virus.  A Robertsonian (Rb) chromosome is a                   stable, centromeric fusion between two normal telecentric                       (chevron shaped) chromosomes, creating a single, metacentric                    (X-  shaped) chromosome.  The large Robertsonian chromosome in                  each line will be separated from the rest of the mouse                          chromosomes using high resolution, dual-laser sorter (FACS) and                 blotted to nylon filters.  This panel will allow the rapid                      mapping of sequences involved in the development or function of                 the nervous system and will greatly facilitate the study of                     mouse mutants at the molecular level.",
