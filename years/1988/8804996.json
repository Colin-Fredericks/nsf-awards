 "awd_abstract_narration": "During summer 1988, eight undergraduate students will receive                   training in analysis and interpretation of data from a major new                social science survey, the National Survey of Families and                      Households (NSFH).  Each student will be supervised by one or two               of the NSFH faculty research team.  A graduate assistant will                   provide training on the VAX computer system, and on personal                    computers, for data analysis and report writing.  Students will                 learn to extract working files from the large survey file, to                   perform basic statistical analyses, to document data, and to                    present findings in tabular, graphical and written form.  They                  will interact daily with faculty supervisors and meet weekly as a               group to discuss data and computing problems, and to report on                  research findings.  At the end of the summer, students will                     present short papers on their research projects in colloquia                    attended by graduate students and faculty of the Center for                     Demography and Ecology.  These papers will be candidates for                    inclusion in the CDE Working Paper series.                                                                                                                      Applicants for the REU program will be recruited from state and                 private colleges in the upper Midwest, particularly those with                  relatively high minority enrollments.  UW-Madison's current                     recruiting procedures for two ongoing undergraduate research                    programs aimed at minority students will be used to obtain                      applicants for the NSFH program.",
