 "awd_abstract_narration": "A relatively high degree of self-knowledge is generally assumed when            information about people's values is elicited for public policy                 purposes.  This assumption may be appropriate when people are familiar          with a good and have extensive experience in valuing it.  However, the          available empirical evidence suggests that people may care about such           things as maintaining a clean environment, reducing perceived risks, or         protecting their health without really knowing much about the good in           question or their own value for it.  In particular, people may be               unable to make even simple trade-offs involving such goods, let alone           the ratio comparisons required by monetary measures of value.                                                                                                   This award involves a three-part sequence of studies that will attempt          to develop the key elements of a general theoretical framework to               assess the nature of expressed values and the compatibility of value            structures and value elicitation approaches.  The research examines the         way individuals define their values within different response scales            and policy context.  It then investigates how learning about the good           itself and about the policy context changes individuals' expressed              values.  The research will result in alternative conceptions of the             valuation processes that, by more accurately portraying the source and          structure of individual values, is also able to lead to improved                methods for choosing between competing public policy alternatives.",
