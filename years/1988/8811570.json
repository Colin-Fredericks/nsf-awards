 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is concerned with the investigation of                    sounds emanating from muscles as they are contracted in the field               of bioengineering.  Sounds made by contracting muscles represent                the means to obtain knowledge about muscle biomechanics and the                 processes of muscle contraction.                                                                                                                                Based upon previous results, a strong interest has developed in                 the understanding and prediction of muscle sound frequency.                     Using an electromagnetic driving apparatus the instantaneous                    frequency of vibration at different times during muscle                         contraction will be determined.  Experiments will be conducted to               ascertain the exact relationship among the frequency of muscle                  sounds and the length, tension, and mass of the muscle.                         Experiments under conditions of zero passive tension will be                    conducted to find the relationship between frequency and the                    elastic modulus of the muscle.  The effect of temperature on                    muscle sound production and frequency will be examined.                                                                                                         There is high potential that muscle sounds may be used as a                     diagnostic tool for human muscles.  Sounds measured from                        functioning muscle tissue near an artificial limb could be used                 as control signals for the artificial limb.  Muscle sounds can                  also be used as a method of measuring the extent of muscle                      fatigue.",
