Martin Resnick of Case                      Western Reserve University and Hiroki Watanabe of the Kyoto                     Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.  Participants                 from the United States and Japan will meet in Washington, D.C.                  during October 1988.  The seminar will provide a forum for the                  exchange of data and ideas in the rapidly advancing field of                    diagnostic ultrasound.  Discussions will focus on the                           application of transrectal and transurethral sonography to the                  evaluation and management of patients with diseases of the                      prostate and bladder.                                                                                                                                           Ultrasound techniques offer tremendous potential in screening                   for and staging certain diseases, such as cancer of the prostate                and bladder.  This seminar, by bringing together leaders in                     urologic ultrasound research from our two countries, will help                  to establish common diagnostic criteria and lead to increased                   cooperative efforts.",
