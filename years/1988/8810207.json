 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many Western observers of international relations believe that a                major underlying problem remains the creation and management of                 orderly relations among states.  A substantial degree of                        orderliness in relations is required for regularizing mutually                  beneficial economic and cultural exchange and for assuring the                  avoidance of mutually destructive violent conflicts.  Defending                 and incrementally developing an existing order is thus seen to be               a prime objective for responsible statecraft.                                                                                                                   To explain how incomplete international orders endure and change                is the focus of a prominent and active subfield of international                organization, called regime theory.  A regime is a set of more or               less mutually acknowledged rules - - including principles, norms                and decision-making procedures as well as international                         agreements.  International behavior in conformance with the rules               can in some circumstances produce convergent expectations about                 the future and lead to shared recognitions of national security.                                                                                                This project undertakes methodological extension in two                         directions, by developing ways to utilize textual sources, and by               constructing computational methods for analyzing data bases of                  rules derived from appropriate texts.  First, the texts of formal               negotiated agreements -- specifically the Anti-Ballistic Missile                Treaty of 1972 and the treaty on the elimination of intermediate-               range and shorter-range missiles (INF Treaty) of 1987 - - are                   used as source materials for the derivation and explication of                  rules which, if adhered to, constrain subsequent interactions                   between the United States and the Soviet Union.  These agreements               are selected because they contain both detailed quantitative                    limits and broad restrictive principles, and because they create                new forums for joint management of their implementation.  Second,               the rules are expressed in a language which a computer can                      understand and are organized into a formal data base, similar to                a numerical spreadsheet but containing not numbers but statements               of permission and prohibition.  Finally, a computational logic                  language is applied to pose questions to the data base concerning               which activities conform and which violate the rule sets.                                                                                                       The objective is to develop methods for constructing a data base                of rules from textual materials, to demonstrate how international               behavior can be related to rule-compliance or rule-violation, and               thus to establish conceptual and methodological foundations for                 follow-on empirical analysis of regime possibilities in the very                important area of superpower security relations.",
