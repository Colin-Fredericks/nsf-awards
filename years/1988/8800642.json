 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many marine animals living in soft sediments alter their                behavior depending on near-bottom flow speeds.  At low flow,                    feeding on deposited particulate matter is common, while at                     higher flow animals often switch to feeding on suspended matter.                This \"switching\" is thought to be beneficial in terms of using                  better food items or minimizing competitive interactions due to                 limited food resources.  However, little direct evidence exists                 that animals obtain a net benefit by switching their feeding                    behavior. Laboratory experiments will be conducted on three                     bottom-dwelling species with different capacities for switching.                A seawater flume will be used to create environments differing in               flow speeds and availability of suspended and deposited                         particulate matter.  Feeding and growth rates of individual                     animals will be measured to test hypotheses about the benefits                  obtained under these differing conditions. Selected experiments                 will be replicated at sites in the field where flow regime and                  supply of suspended particulate matter vary.",
