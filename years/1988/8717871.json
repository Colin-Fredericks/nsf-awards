 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry provides                     support for work by Dr. Glen A. Russell, Iowa State University,                 focused on the one-electron reduction or oxidation of neutral                   radicals in chain and non-chain processes.  The work extends to                 the application of free radical chain processes involving                       alkylmercury halides with the primary objective of developing                   selective additive alkylation processes for electron-poor and                   electron-rich substituted alkenes. It is believed that such                     alkenes, which yield adduct radicals that can be classified as                  acceptor or donor species, can be induced to participate in                     chain reactions by electron transfer between the adduct                         radicals and added donor acceptor molecules or ions.  The added                 donor or acceptor molecule or ion will be chosen so that                        electron transfer yields a new radical or radical ion capable                   of rapidly reacting with the alkylmercury halide to regenerate                  an alkyl radical.                                                                                                                                               The study also involves physical organic studies on the                         reactivity of alkyl radicals, particularly towards unsaturated                  systems, and includes new studies concerning the regiochemistry                 of radical attack, the stereoselectivity of radical addition                    and the stereospecificity of radical substitution occurring by                  an addition-elimination sequence.  This data will be applied in                 a diagnostic fashion to establish or eliminate the presence of                  radical processes in reactions of other organometallic                          tert-butylating agents.",
