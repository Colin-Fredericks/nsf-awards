 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program funds                   research which explores the fundamental chemistry associated                    with reactions involving organic molecules and transition metal                 complexes.  Research in this area will provide knowledge of                     reaction pathways between metals and organics which will be                     important in areas such as surface science, material science                    and heterogeneous catalysis.                                                                                                                                    The goal of this project is the development of detailed                         mechanistic understanding of reactions between organic                          molecules and transition metal complexes. One focus of this                     project is the metal-mediated formation of carbon-carbon and                    carbon-hydrogen bonds, since such processes are central to the                  construction of complex carbon frameworks from simple ones.  In                 addition, emphasis will be placed on organometallic reactions                   that are involved in the formation of carbon-nitrogen and                       carbon-oxygen bonds, as substantially less is known at present                  about these transformations.  The project also involves                         collaborative studies designed to enhance understanding of                      reaction mechanisms and explore new areas in which                              organometallic chemistry might have an impact.  These include                   experiments designed to study the thermodynamics of                             organometallic reactions, measure the rapid rates of reaction                   of coordinatively unsaturated and paramagnetic intermediates,                   attach oriented metal-based molecules to electrodes, and                        examine the possibility of utilizing metal complexes bound to                   antibodies as catalysts having high specificities.",
