 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in S/T relations has two major thrusts.  The first                 involves the study of the interactive, nonlinear processes that                 govern the behavior of plasma within the magnetospheres and                     ionospheres of the earth, other planets, and in the interplanetary              medium.  Special emphasis today is on the development of quantitative           models with the aim of understanding and eventually predicting the              influence of solar variations - both short and long term - on the               earth's magnetosphere, ionosphere, and atmosphere.  This includes               detailed studies of microscopic processes which affect the transport            of energy, momentum, and mass through the solar                                 wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere (SMI) system as well as the global                modeling of this system.  The second thrust uses the geo-plasma                 environment as a laboratory for furthering our knowledge of                     fundamental plasma processes which may duplicate natural processes              under controlled conditions (e.g. artificial aurora) or which occur             under plasma conditions difficult to achieve in ground laboratories             (e.g., collisionless shocks).  This will help to better understand              the complex interactions of the plasma environment with man-made                objects (shuttle, space station, satellites) such as wake effects,              differential charging, and perturbations due to gas releases and                particle-beam injections, for example.                                              This grant supports the study of plasma waves, small-scale                  structures and their dynamics, and turbulence which have considerable           impact on the global dynamics of the large-scale SMI system.  Regions           in which processes of this kind occur are to be found throughout the            earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere.  Because of the lack of                   multi-point observations, the true temporal and three-dimensional               spatial structures on spatial scales of several 100 to several 1000km           are not well known.  Such measurements will, however, become                    available in the future.  Small-scale structures, turbulent motions,            and microscopic wave-particle interactions can also be studied                  without detailed knowledge of the overall state of the system,                  whereas the reverse is not true.  Global studies require knowledge of           boundary conditions and transport coefficients which only local                 studies can provide.  Thus the microscopic plasma phenomena developed           under this grant are needed prior to the task of developing global              models.",
