 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports U.S. - Chile Cooperative Research                           in Crustal Deformation, work to be performed by Steven                          N. Ward of the U. of Cal., Santa Cruz and Sergio                                Barrientos of the U. of Chile. They propose to study                            the coseismic displacement field of the 1960                                    earthquake in southern Chile and the postseismic                                deformation of that event and the 1985 earthquake in                            Central Chile. Geodetic elevation changes,                                      triangulation measurements and tide gauge observations                          will be used to indicate the location and intensity of                          coseismic slip and interseismic creep in great detail.                                                                                                          There is important geodetic and seismic data available                          for Chile. The U.S. training and Chilean contacts of                            Barrientos will facilitate the utilization of these                             datasets and the collection of new measurements. This                           is an excellent opportunity for mutually beneficial                             scientific cooperation between U.S. and Chilean                                 scientists. The Chileans will be able to use the                                advanced techniques of the U.S. scientists to handle                            this data and the U.S. scientists will learn the                                details of stress accumulation during the earthquake                            cycle. This modest award will help maintain a useful                            international scientific relationship.",
