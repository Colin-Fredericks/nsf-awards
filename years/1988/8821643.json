 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support a comprehensive literature review                to determine what existing evidence says about the determinants                 of student decisions to enter post-secondary science and enginee-               ring studies.  Special emphasis will be placed on the  factors                  that influence student selection of pre-college preparation, the                influence of gender and ethnic characteristics, and the influence               of public and private programs.  Computerized bibliographic                     search techniques will be used in identifying both theoretical                  and empirical work from the several relevant research disciplines               including education, sociology, and economics.  The project will                produce an integrated overview of existing evidence, hard-copy                  abstracts, and electronic abstracts for the literature reviewed.                     This is the first of a series of structured literature                     reviews planned to provide a comprehensive assessment of what                   existing evidence says about the various factors that determine                 the supply and demand of scientists and engineers.  Results will                improve understanding of the science and engineering labor market               pipeline and operation, identify gaps in evidence, and inform                   further research relevant to science and engineering personnel                  decision-makers.",
