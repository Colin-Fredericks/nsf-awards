 "awd_abstract_narration": "Retired scientists and engineers will be recruited through scientific           and professional societies to serve as volunteers in schools to support         math/science teaching programs.  The program will be carried out in             cooperation with the Baltimore school system.  Three teachers will be           placed in each of four Baltimore schools after approriate training and          orientation.  Under the guidance of school system personnel, they will          be used in ways deemed most useful by the teachers and administrators.          The program will run for the academic years 1988-89 and 1989-90.                Performance of the volunteers will be carefully monitored and evaluated.        On the basis of this evaluation, literature will be prepared for                dissemination to schools, professional societies, and businesses                outlining successful procedures which could be duplicated elsewhere.                                                                                            Cost sharing by the NESC and the Baltimore School District will equal           115% of the NSF funding.",
