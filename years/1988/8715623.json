 "awd_abstract_narration": "An expert system is designed to solve hard problems usually requiring           considerable expertise.  Users are more likely to accept such a system          if they can ask for and receive explanations of the system's conclusion.        Our contention is that improved explanations can be generated by a              knowledge-based explanation system (loosely coupled to the expert               system) that actively searches for support of the expert system's               conclusion.  Current methods of explanation derive their informtion             almost entirely from a trace of the rules used during the expert                system's problem-solving process.  Additional information, when present         at all, is introduced through justifications of these rules.  We propose        to build a system that treats the generation of explanations as a               problem-solving activity largely distinct from the processes initially          used to solve a problem.  This system will move expert system                   explanation from a passive (unintelligent) task of presenting rule              traces to an active (intelligent) task of searching for explanations in         support of the conclusion of the problem-solving expert system.  At the         center of our knowledge-based explanation techniques (the knowledge of          how to explain).  This knowledge will influence not only the way                information is presented to the user, but also what information is              presented tothe user.  With this ability to determine both the content          and form of the explanation, our system will have increased flexibility         over previous explanation systems.  This increased flexibility will be          used to support the creation of explanations that more naturally support        the expert system's conclusion.",
