 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long range structure of materials is currently being studied                using small angle scattering of slow (\"cold\") neutrons and X-                   rays.  Local order is studied by diffraction.  With the advent of               stronger sources of cold neutrons, and the current situation with               X-ray sources, there is a need for much higher speed of response                in large area arrays.  Present ion-chamber wire arrays are                      limited to about 40,000 cts/s TOTAL with 10% deadtime.  Ratios of               10,000 cts/s PER PIXEL, with little crosstalk, would \"amount to a               revolution in cold-neutron physics\".  Curved detectors are                      impractical with stretched wires.  The use of semiconductor sub-                arrays, 5 cm square, with 5 mm square elements, would allow                     substantially spherical array systems.  The present project will                develop fast, efficient sub-arrays comprising a converter layer                 with 100 detectors, 100 amplifier chains and 100 scaler/readout                 registers located on a few slices of silicon.  The present                      research will test the detector portion of the system and study                 the feasibility of the complete system.",
