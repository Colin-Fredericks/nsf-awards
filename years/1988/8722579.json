 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dinosaur trackways represent a unique and important resource               for interpreting functional morphology and the evolution of                     behavior.  Dr. James Farlow proposes a new experimental approach                to interpreting dinosaur trackways.  He proposes to videotape and               analyze how flightless ratite birds leave their footprints in a                 variety of sedimentary substrata.  Along with undergraduate                     research collaborators, the Principal Investigator will analyze                 the effects of substrate character and the age and anatomy of                   several bird species on the resulting tracks.  Dinosaur trackways               of Cretaceous age in Texas will then be studied, using the                      experimental findings to interpret the variability found among                  the fossil footprints.                                                               The proposed research has implications beyond the study of                 dinosaur trackways themselves.  This innovative experimental                    approach will allow paleontologists to more accurately                          reconstruct the identities, abundances and age distributions of                 dinosaurs that shared an ancient habitat.  The project will                     provide new insight into the biomechanics and gait of dinosaurs,                and into their social structure and behavior as well.  Dr. Farlow               will be using the most current techniques for computer-aided                    shape analysis of the footprints, and his undergraduate students                will gain important research experience under his supervision.",
