 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of portable equipment (e.g., radio transceivers, portable               communication devices, medical-related instrumentation, sensing                 devices, night vision equipment, high-rate missile firing systems)              over a wide range of conditions have placed an increased premium on             the development of improved batteries.  The problems to be addressed            in the proposed program are how to increase the cell energy/power               density as they are affected by electrolyte and cathode material, and           how to increase the potential at which reduction occurs.  A further             problem is how to improve cell safety by using a less reactive,                 energy-dense anode material such as calcium.                                                                                                                    Lithium batteries, which combine a high energy-density anode with an            equally high energy-density cathode, are very attractive power                  sources.  Primary batteries, such as Li/SOC1  or Li/SO , have the               highest energy density, but they suffer from serious safety hazards             and high cost.  Any leak in the can of such batteries releases a                highly-corrosive acidic vapor.  Secondary batteries with organic                electrolytes, such as Li/TiS  and Li/MoS , offer a rechargeable                 system, but at significantly reduced specific energy density \u013165-120            W-hr/kg or 35 to 65 A-hr/kg, respectively!.  Other primary systems              (Li/MnO  or Li/CF ) offer higher safety and lower cost but at reduced           power density.  The new Ca/electrolyte/TAA-C system to be demonstrated          technically feasible by Tracer under the proposed Phase I program               offers a combination of characteristics of these battery types: high            energy/power density with a high level of safety and low cost.                                                                                                  This new class of batteries consists of cells with calcium anodes,              TAA-catalyzed carbon cathodes and organic electrolytes: the innovative          approach of the proposed program lies in the proper choice of the               cathode catalyst and electrolyte components.  Tracer plans to develop           a catholyte/cathode system which provides a cell with energy/power              density sufficient to be a commercially viable power source.                                                                                                    The research plan is well thought out and the personnel is very                 capable.  Phase I funding is recommended.",
