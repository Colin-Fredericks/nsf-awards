 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research program is to evaluate several              different methods for predicting pore water pressure buildup in                 saturated cohesionless soils when subjected to cyclic shear stresses.           Such stresses are generated as a result of the strong ground motions            resulting from a large earthquake.                                                                                                                                   The buildup in pore water pressure can result in the failure of            building foundations, as well as of underground lifelines such as water,        sewer, power, and telecommunication lifelines. The damage results from          the liquefaction of the soil when the pore pressure reaches a critical          level. Thus, it is very important to be able to predict the generation          of pore water pressure, and the potential for the soil to liquefy.              Considerable effort has gone into the development of prediction methods,        but the validation of these methods is far from complete due to a lack          of data against which to check them.                                                                                                                                 In April 12, 1986, the Molikpaq, a hydrocarbon exploration island          in the Beaufort Sea, was subjected to ice loads which had not been              predicted, and which caused the sand core to partially liquefy. The             structural performance of this sand island was closely monitored by the         owner, Gulf Canada, and as a result, an excellent data set exist against        which to check the methods                                                      proposed for calculating pore pressure generation and                           liquefaction. This data set is being made available for research                purposes, and a research program has been initiated by the                      following Canadian Government organizations: The Geological                     Survey, the Subcommittee on Marine Development of the National                  Research Council's Associate Committee on Geotechnical Research,                and the Panel on Energy Research and Development. A similar study               supported by the National Science Foundation is closely                         coordinated with the Canadian initiative.                                                                                                                            This joint effort between the Rutgers University and Prof.                 Prevost at Princeton University, is part of this study. Coupled                 dynamic field equations calculate pore fluid and soil skeleton                  response concurrently, accounting for dynamic interaction between               the two phases. Multi-yield surface plasticity is used to                       accurately model the nonlinear, hysteretic behavior of the soil                 skeleton. The numerical calculations are performed using a                      general purpose, three-dimensional nonlinear finite element                     program.                                                                                                                                                             The results from both the Canadian and NSF studies will be                 presented at a workshop to be held in Vancouver in August, 1988.",
