 "awd_abstract_narration": "This supplement is responsive to the NSF initiative \"Facilitation               Awards for Handicapped Scientists and Engineers\".  The equipment                comprises special access desks to house equipment provided by an                earlier equipment grant, and a Vax Graphic tablet to address the PI's           finger dexterity difficulties.  The equipment project being                     supplemented provides equipment to experimentally investigate the               nonlinear oscillatory behavior of structures.  The equipment, a                 dynamic signal analyzer, collects data from physical structures                 undergoing vibration tests.  Nonlinear oscillations have been studied           extensively in the past.  These studies have focused on long term               time response, the behavior exhibited long after transients have                decayed.  This project investigates how the motion evolves during the           decay of the transients.  Two projects benefit from the use of the              equipment.  The first focuses on the vibration of a cantilevered                beam. Theoretical claims have been made for the potential of                    dangerous vibrations for certain types of disturbances.  This project           will attempt to substantiate these claims.  A second project is                 concerned with rotating systems where theoretical claims have also              been made for serious nonlinear behavior.  These claims will be                 investigated through experimentation.",
