 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many exciting possibilities are now becoming realities in biology and           medicine due to the use of recombinant DNA.  Human insulin, growth              hormone and several other hormones are now becoming available for the           first time in quantity.  Undergraduate students need to understand the          fundamentals of these methods in order to participate in the future             advances in biology and medicine.                                                                                                                               A DNA Laboratory Workshop for Undergraduate Science Faculty is an               intensive week-long program for small college teachers.  The workshop,          consisting of lecture, laboratory and discussion periods, will enable           25 science faculty who have never had \"hands-on\" experience with                recombinant DNA laboratory techniques to gain familiarity with several          of these techniques.  These new techniques will then be taught in the           undergraduate college setting.                                                                                                                                  The DNA workshop will be hosted by a consortium of eight Liberal Arts           colleges in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia (the East Central             Colleges, or ECC), but will include science faculty members from about          twelve to fourteen colleges.  The instructional staff will consist of           staff scientists from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, a leading                  laboratory in DNA research and education.  The workshop will be held at         Bethany College in Bethany, WV.                                                                                                                                 In addition to NSF funds, the participants' institutions will provide           about 20% in travel funds.",
