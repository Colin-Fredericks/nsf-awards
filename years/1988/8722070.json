 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will supply shipboard scientific support equipment                 for the research vessel CONRAD, operated by the Lamont-Doherty                  Geological Observatory of Columbia University and dedicated to                  use in support of ocean science research.                                                                                                                       The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds               for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe                      conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support                for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the                deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational                equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite                        receivers to pin point the location of research sites,                          communication equipment including radio transceivers and                        satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data                            communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats                  for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.                                                                                                   The Project Directors, Robert D. Gerard and Dennis E. Hayes are                 fully qualified to direct this project having had considerable                  experience in overseeing the acquisition and installation of                    shipboard equipment.                                                                                                                                            This project will allow the institution to increase the hydro                   winch's speed for improve wire handling, acquire radar                          replacement parts, two VHF radios, and a digital scale for safe                 loading of scientific equipment.  It will also improve safety                   through the installation of liferaft floodlights and reflectors.",
