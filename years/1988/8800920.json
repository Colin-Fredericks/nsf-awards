 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to simulate enriched CO2 atmospheres provides a                unique opportunity to: 1) study the dynamics of plant/herbivore                 interactions under these conditions; and 2) examine plant                       allocation patterns under controlled carbon and nitrogen                        availabilities.  The nutritional ecology and fitness of                         herbivores feeding on plants grown in enhanced CO2 environments                 over several generations will be investigated.  In addition, the                effects of herbivores on plant fitness under different CO2                      conditions will be compared.  Plantago lanceolata                               (Plantaginaceae), a herbaceous perennial which contains iridoid                 glycosides, and a specialist herbivore, Junonia coenia                          (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae), which uses these compounds as feeding               and oviposition stimulants, will serve as an excellent system to                study these interactions.                                                            To examine trade-offs in allocation of carbon and nitrogen                 resources to growth, reproduction, and defense, individuals of                  two plant species, differing in the classes of allelochemicals                  they contain, will be grown under varying carbon (CO2) and                      nitrogen availabilities.  Growth, reproductive output and                       allelochemical content will be determined for P. lanceolata                     (which contains iridoid glycosides) and Penstemon digitalis                     (Scrophulariaceae) which contains both nitrogen-based (alkaloids)               and carbon-based (phenolics and iridoid glycosides)                             allelochemicals.",
