 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Donald               Kirwan of the Bioprocess/Product Development Center at the                      University of Virginia and Professor John M. Smith of the Process               Biotechnology Program at the University of Surrey in the United                 Kingdom.  Both of these research groups are investigating improved              reactors for animal cell culture.                                                                                                                               The increased demand for monoclonal antibodies, therapeutic                     proteins, vaccines, and other high value products of animal cell                culture requires that efficient larger scale processing methods be              developed.  This proposal deals with the initiation of a                        cooperative research effort between two groups devoted to this                  activity.  The joint research will focus on two topics:                         1) The measurement and modeling of shear stress fields in                       bioreactors and (2) the role of diffusion in influencing the                    productivity of immobilized animal cells.  The first project will               involve the investigation of the turbulent shear created by bubble              coalesence events in aerated bioreactors.  The understanding of                 shear fields will be directly applicable to the culturing of animal             cells.  The second project will involve diffusion and reaction of               nutrients, oxygen, and cell regulators in animal cell-filled gel                particles.  The concentrations and time varying patterns of                     biochemicals can be important to cell productivity.  The                        researchers will model this phenomena based upon data on                        diffusivities in gels, cell uptake rates, and the influence of                  regulators in free cell cultures.",
