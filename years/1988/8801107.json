 "awd_abstract_narration": "Principal Investigators Kitchell and Fink propose to                    organize and run a 2-week workshop/short course on modern methods               of morphometrics.  Morphometrics goes beyond multivariate                       approaches to morphology, in that it attempts to capture and                    analyze the geometrical entirety of a specimen, rather than a                   sampling of that morphology as embodied in an arbitrary set of                  measurements chosen by an investigator.  Morphometrics usually                  involves direct capture of images onto computers using video                    cameras, followed by selection of point coordinates for study.                  Up to roughly 25 supported participants will have lectures and                  hands-on tutorials from the leading developers of analytical                    approaches.  Hardware and software will be made available                       throughout the course, and research problems will be conducted as               practical exercises.                                                                    Morphometrics is a relatively new approach to an old                    discipline.  It holds promise for greater objectivity and                       repeatability.  These new procedures have not been widely                       applied, but the proposed workshop will greatly increase the pool               of practitioners who can then train others and submit proposals                 for their own instruments for data acquisition and analysis.  The               proposed workshop/short course addresses several of the explicit                initiatives of the Systematic Biology Program: new technologies,                graduate training, and centers for inter-disciplinary research.",
