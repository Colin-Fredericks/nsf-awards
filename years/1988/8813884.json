 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this proposal are:   to use a nuclear magnetic                resonance (NMR) technique to measure the spin densities and the                 spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation times of normal fluids and                mixtures of normal fluids including carbon dioxide at moderate to               advanced pressures; and to correlate the resulting measurements                 with macroscopic thermodynamic and transport properties and with                corresponding states parameters.  The proposed objectives                       constitute a significant extension from a recently developed                    corresponding states correlation for the relaxation times of pure               liquid alkanes at near-normal pressures.  The relaxation times                  can be correlated directly with corresponding states parameters,                indicating that the Debye and Stokes-Einstein assumptions need                  not be invoked to relate the relaxation time to transport                       properties.  The significance of being able to relate NMR                       measurables both to transport coefficients and to state variables is            evident, e.g. in quantitative NMR imaging.  The relationship                    amongst NMR measurables, such as transport properties, and                      corresponding states parameters suggests that multiple pathways                 exist from NMR measurables to macroscopic thermodynamic and                     transport coefficients.                                                                                                                                         In recent years, a significant advance has been made by relating                NMR measurables to corresponding state values for pure liquids.                 If these relationships can be extended to liquid mixtures, as                   proposed, and then demonstrated to be accurately observed in                    porous media, the results can have direct and important                         application in petroleum production studies.  Industry is in need of a          rapid, continuous, and accurate system for following the                        effects of diffusion and dispersion in the transition region when one           fluid displaces a second liquid from a core by miscibility                      difference phenomena.  Being able to observe what occurs (and how               rapidly it happens) within a reservoir rock for example, would greatly          facilitate transfer of new miscible oil recovery processes from the             laboratory to the field.",
