 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Graduate School of Oceanography at the Univ. of Rhode Island                will acquire several items of oceanographic instrumentation to be               placed in a pool of shared use equipment.  This equipment is                    maintained for use on or in association with the R/V ENDEAVOR, a                research vessel owned by the NSF and operated by the university.                A substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1988 is              in support of NSF-sponsored research projects.  The instrumenta-                tion will also increase the capabilities of the ship and of the                 University to support research and engineering activities.  The                 instrumentation includes:                                                                                                                                       -Shipboard Remote Sensing Computer and image display equipment to                provide scientists on board with near real-time data collected                  from satellites,                                                               -shallow-water CTD for making precision measurements of seawater                 Temperature and Conductivity as a function of Depth,                           -a CTD deck control unit,                                                       -a fluorometer for measuring chlorophyll and other pigments in the               water column,                                                                  -water sampling bottles, and                                                    -a decompression computer for enhancing safety of at-sea SCUBA                   diving operations.
