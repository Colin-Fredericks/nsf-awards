 "awd_abstract_narration": "A basic objective of current research on the chemistry of                  the atmosphere is to develop an improved understanding of the                   fundamental processes responsible for creating and destroying                   the trace chemical compounds present in the atmosphere.  In                     order to study and understand the chemical, physical and                        biological processes influencing the composition of the                         atmosphere it is necessary to investigate and develop improved                  techniques for measuring the compounds present in the air.  The                 objective of this project is to develop reliable new analytical                 techniques for studying the cycle of sulfur species through the                 global troposphere.  These techniques have been designed to                     permit measurement of the concentrations of gaseous species                     currently thought to be important in the biogeochemical cycling                 of sulfur, carbon disulfide, through the atmosphere.  These                     species include carbonyl sulfide, carbon disulfide, hydrogen                    sulfide, dimethyl sulfide, methyl mercaptan, and sulfur                         dioxide.                                                                             The marine sulfur cycle is particularly interesting                        because it may link biological activity in the oceans to                        climate and cloud formation.  Measurements of the                               concentrations of sulfur species provide data that are                          important for developing a quantitative understanding of the                    fluxes and reactions of these sulfur compounds.                                      A technique of gas chromatography/mass spectrometer with                   isotopically labelled internal standards (GC/MS/ILS) has been                   developed and laboratory tested under NSF grant ATM-8515000.                    The instrumentation is capable of real time measurements of                     sulfur gases and is several times more sensitive than flame                     photometric detection.  Isotopically labelled internal                          standards have improved precision and accuracy.  This research                  will construct a field deployable (aircraft and ship platforms)                 instrument and test the performance of the instrument in the                    field.",
