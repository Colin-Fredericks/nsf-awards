Fossan,                   Nuclear Structure Laboratory, Physics Department, State University              of New York at Stony Brook and Professor P.J. Twin, Department of               Physics, University of Liverpool.  Both the Stony Brook and                     Liverpool research groups have been involved in closely related                 spectroscopy research programs and have carried out complimentary               work on the extraction of nuclear structure properties.                         The Daresbury Laboratory has two unique experimental facilities                 that have been effectively used in conjunction with their 22 MV                 tandem accelerator.  The large array of Compton suppressed Ge                   detectors and the recoil mass spectrometer at Daresbury have led to             the discovery of superdeformed bands in 132Ce and in several Nd                 isotopes, and important structure properties in very neutron                    deficient nuclei.                                                                                                                                               This cooperative project will focus on nuclear structure studies in             the A=130 region, with experiments taking place at the LINAC                    laboratory at SUNY Stony Brook and the tandem laboratory at                     Daresbury.",
