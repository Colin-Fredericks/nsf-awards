The goal of the work is to                   meet the increasing demand for efficient synthetic approaches                   to complex organic molecules of theoretical and biological                      interest.  New tools in the form of new reactions and reagents                  will result from this work.                                                                                                                                     Four diverse areas cover a broad scope of endeavor.  A major                    effort asks the question of whether simple molecular entities                   in the form of transition metal complexes can serve as                          catalysts for selective organic transformations in a fashion                    analogous to what enzymes do for the living cell.  Manipulation                 of allyl systems for chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and                            enantioselective transformations will involve exploring                         designed complexes embracing Pd, Mo, and W.  Intramolecular                     carbametallation of unsaturated functional groups represents a                  new exciting thrust for ring construction.  Such reactions                      involving molecular change by isomerization enters an era of                    designing reactions for minimizing chemical waste and therefore                 minimizing disposal.  Another development envisions a general                   cycloaddition approach to odd membered rings in contrast to the                 extremely import Diels-Alder reaction.  Bifunctional reagents                   which do not self-annihilate but may be activated by transition                 metal templates provide the basis for such a development.                       Unexpected reactvity of organosulfur compounds provides a                       unique opportunity for multifaceted reactivity.  These reagents                 become \"chemical chameleons\" since they can totally                             interconvert between two opposing types of reactivity depending                 upon their environment.  They also offer a unique approach for                  asymmetric synthesis.  The final section deals with the concept                 of designing composite functional groups or \"pseudofunctional                   groups\" based upon a partnership of strain and reactivity.",
