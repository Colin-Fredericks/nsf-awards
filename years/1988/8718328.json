 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal on \"Electronic Transport in Amorphous Silicon                     Multilayers,\" between Dr. Hellmut Fritzsche of the University of                Chicago and Professor CHEN Kunji of Nanjing University, is jointly              sponsored by NSF and the State Educational Commission (SEDC) of                 China.                                                                                                                                                          The investigators point out that with amorphous semiconductors, it              is possible to make ultrathin multilayers (superlattices) cheaper               and out of many more materials than it is with crystalline                      semiconductors (microchips), as well as to extend the device                    possibilities to large sized applications inappropriate for small,              fragile crystals.  These amorphous semiconductors, consisting of                hundreds of ultra thin layers of hydrogenated amorphous silicon and             other materials, each layer either a few atomic layers thick to                 hundreds of atoms thick, possess several useful new transport                   properties which cannot be obtained in unlayered semiconductors,                namely metastable conductance states which are produced by a short              light pulse or by a high bias voltage.  The quasi two dimensional               nature of these multilayers allows new material properties to be                designed. The investigators will explore the relation of these                  metastable and bistable conductance processes with the structure,               defect concentration, and the hydrogen content of the multilayers.",
