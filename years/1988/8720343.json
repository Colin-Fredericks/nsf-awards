 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this investigation is to increase understanding                of metamorphic reactions and fluid behavior in subduction zones by              constructing a 2-dimensional numerical heat transfer model that                 incorporates heat conduction, advection, and metamorphic                        reactions.  The numerical model will predict the thermal evolution              and fluid production within a subduction zone as a function of                  time and position.  Parameters to be varied include the age of                  oceanic lithosphere, convergence rate, volatile content of oceanic              crust, and the nature and enthalpy of metamorphic dehydration and               hydration reactions.  This model differs from previous thermal                  models of subduction zones in that (1) both dehydration reactions               in the downgoing slab and hydration reactions in the overlying                  mantle wedge are incorporated and (2) the model predicts fluid                  production as a function of depth.  The validity of the model will              be tested by comparison with surface heat flow measurements from                Tohoku, Japan and rocks of the Trinity thrust system, a Devonian                paleo-subduction zone located in northern California.  The results              of this investigation will provide insight into the generation of               arc magmas.",
