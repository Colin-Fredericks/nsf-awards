 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emulsion polymerization involves polymerization in a heterogeneous              system consisting of an aqueous phase and a dispersed oil phase.  The           initiator, initially located in the aqueous phase, diffuses into the            oily phase where growth and termination occur.  These systems exhibit           characteristically high reaction rates and a high degree of                     polymerization.  The product is comprised of collidal polymer paticles          in a stable suspension, often referred to as latex, dispersed in the            aqueous phase.  Some products such as synthetic rubbers, molding                plastics and trade resins must be recovered from the latex before               final formulation and use.  Other products such as surface coatings             and adhesives can utilize the polymeric materials in latex form.                                                                                                The general thrust of this work is to develop a deeper and more                 fundamental understanding of the complex phenomena comprising emulsion          polymerization.  Four projects are planned:                                                                                                                     1.  Copolymerization studies in a reactor system comprising a tubular           prereactor followed by a series of two continuous stirred tank                  reactors (CSTRs).  The focus of the work is measurement of reaction             rate, particle size distibution, composition of the copolymer formed            in each reactor, and molecular weights.  The work will involve studies          of grafting reaction kinetics, morphology of the latex particles from           copolymerization reactions and the use of functional monomers that are          water soluble.                                                                                                                                                  2.  Determination of the distribution of free radicals in latex                 particles.  The focus of the work is on utilizing the concept of a              nonuniform radical distribution to model grafting reactions aimed at            studying the development of particle morphology.                                                                                                                3.  Studying particle concentration and size distribution which                 influences rheology and, in many cases, application performance.  The           work will include studies of particle number control for semi-batch             systems.                                                                                                                                                        4.  Use of functional monomers with carboxyl groups to help stabilize           particles and improve application performance.  The work should                 elucidate, for example, the compositional parameters that characterize          the polymer molecules which are formed in the aqueous and oily phases.                                                                                          The results should assist in the developments of new products and               processes in which grafting reactions, particle characteristics, and            polymer molecular composition variables are important.",
