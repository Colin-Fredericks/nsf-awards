 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many random magnetic systems are characterized by freezing and                  hysteretic behavior at low temperatures.  The dynamics of spin                  glasses, random field systems, random interfaces, and other                     glassy systems will be investigated, using scaling and                          probabilistic renormalization group arguments, simplified models,               and numerical calculations. The emphasis will be on the causes of               the freezing and hysteretic phenomena and the interplay between                 equilibrium and non-equilibrium processes, such as decay of                     remanent magnetization and approach to equilibrium.  In some                    disordered systems, transport processes are highly collective and               non-liniar.  Using sliding charge density waves as a paradigm,                  various cellective transport phenomena will be investigated,                    including flux flow in disordered superconductors and motion of                 interfaces between two fluids in a porous media.  These systems                 do not move until a threshold driving force is reached, and near                this threshold they  exhibit novel non-linear dynamic critical                  phenomena.  Below threshold, hysteretic behavior occurs which                   will also be investigated.  Various quantum statistical phenomena               will also be studied:  spin wave dynamics in strongly quantum                   magnets, (such as solid 3He): scaling behavior near metal-                      insulator transitions; and the effects of dissipation on quantum                phase transitions such as destruction of superconductivity in                   granular materials.",
