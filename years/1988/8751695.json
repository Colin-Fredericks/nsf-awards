 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project offers a month long summer institute for 30 well-                   prepared elementary school teachers from Tennessee which will                   be followed during the academic year with activities at the                     participants school districts.  The focus is on three main                      areas:  geometry, problem-solving, and instructional                            computing.  These are interconnected in the project by                          involving problem-solving activities in the study of the                        geometry topics as well as incorporating computer                               investigations into the geometry and problem-solving                            activities.  The graphic capability of the computer language                    LOGO also serves as the vehicle to develop an interplay                         between the geometry topics and the problem-solving                             situations.  The 30 participants are selected by the school                     districts that have committed to the project and the plan is                    to implement the project activities into the programs at the                    participants' districts to continue the work of the project                     and extend the knowledge and techniques developed to other                      teachers in the districts.",
