 "awd_abstract_narration": "Degradation of proteins within bacteria is an ongoing regulated                 process, which in concert with protein synthesis processes,                     determines the protein make-up of the cell and thus its transport               and reaction properties.  Under conditions of nutrient                          limitation, which are common to many bioprocesses or in                         genetically engineered cells, intracellular protein degradation                 rates are greatly accelerated.  Intracellular protein breakdown                 contributes significantly to maintenance nutrient requirements in               many bioprocess contexts and to loss of product yield in                        recombinant fermentations.  This research will seek engineering                 kinetic descriptions of intracellular protein degradation, which                can be used to guide organism and process design to maximize                    growth and product yields.  In particular, this research will                   provide key data which are needed to improve kinetic models for                 bacterial growth and product synthesis under different growth                   conditions.                                                                                                                                                     This research addresses a central technical limitation in the                   manufacture of biochemicals, such as insulin and amino acids.                   After being synthesized within a genetically engineered cell, a                 protein product such as insulin is frequently attached and                      decomposed by digestive enzymes within that cell.  Similarly,                   cells used to produce amino acids lose their capability to                      produce because critical proteins in those cells are inactivated                by those cells' internal digestive enzymes.  This research will                 study these degradative processes and how their rates might be                  reduced by careful choice of bioprocess operating conditions,                   such as temperature.  Also, various genetic changes in the cell,                which reduce its internal digestive activities, will be                         investigated to minimize productivity loses.  The results of this               research will be guidance of the genetic engineer and the                       biochemical engineer on ways to improve the useful production                   lifetime of the bioprocess.  This lifetime is often a critical                  factor in successful process economic performance.",
