 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to support a six week time-series                     measurement program of sea floor seismicity, and monitoring of a                number of high and low temperature vents.  The instruments will                 be deployed on the Endeavor Segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge;                  ALVIN will be used for emplacement and recovery.  The deployment                will consist of an array of ocean bottom seismometers, operated                 by J. McClain of UC, Davis under a subcontract to the University                of Washington, conventional thermocouple arrays, and instrumented               water column moorings involving standard rotary current meters.                 In addition  \"innovative\" instruments such as a time-lapse video                camera, and an electromagnetic flow meter will be emplaced.  The                hope is to obtain a record of temporal variations in thermal and                fluid output from the vents and that can be correlated with                     observed seismicity. This work is seen as an excellent                          opportunity to deploy and test some new types of instruments for                monitoring hydrothermal vents.  The project is part of the RIDGE                Initiative, a component of Global Geosciences. If successful,                   this work would be an important step toward characterizing                      temporal variability in hydrothermal output from an ocean ridge                 vent field and could lead to significant advances in long term                  monitoring of ridge crest hydrothermal activity.",
