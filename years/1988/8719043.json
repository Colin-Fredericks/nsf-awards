 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mucosal surfaces are in constant contact with the external                  environment.  Therefore, the mucosal immune system must deal with               constant antigenic stimulation.  The goals of this research are                 to understand the role of lymphokines (soluble regulatory                       molecules produced by thymus derived T cells) in the generation                 of mucosal immunity.  The types and amounts of lymphokines                      produced by T cells residing in gut-associated lymphoid tissues,                Peyer's patches, and mesenteric lymph nodes will be compared with               the lymphokines produced by T cells isolated from the systemic                  lymphoid organs, spleen and peripheral lymph nodes.  Lymphokines                will be measured in the supernatants of T cells activated in                    vitro by polyclonal stimulators.  The ability of these                          lymphokines to affect immunoglobulin isotype will be determined.                In addition, lymphokine gene expression by T cells isolated from                different lymphoid organs after polyclonal stimulation will be                  analyzed.                                                                                                                                                       The mucosal surface lining the digestive tract is a major site of               interaction between an organism and its environment.  Normal                    function of cells of the immune system in this tissue is required               for maintenance of the normal state of the organism.  In spite                  of the great importance of this subject, little is known about                  the regulation of function of these cells.  The results of this                 research will provide important new information concerning the                  signaling molecules involved in regulation of the normal defense                mechanisms associated with the mucosa of the digestive tract.",
