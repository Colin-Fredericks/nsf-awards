 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this two-year cooperative research project between             James Gill, University of California, Santa Cruz and Liang                      Zhoucheng, Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Geochemistry is            to perform U Th disequilibrium studies of Northeast Asian alkali                basalts.  The investigators will concentrate on \"young\" basalts from            volcanic eruptions in Northern China 265 years ago.  Through                    radioactive isotopic studies the investigators will determine the               source of the Chinese basalts, study chemical fractionation during              basalt genesis and date the age of the samples.  U Th disequilbrium             studies are useful tools for studying the origins of volcanic rocks,            composition of the earth's mantle and the processes causing mantle              heterogeneities.                                                                                                                                                The U.S.-China collaboration is significant in several respects.  U             Th disequilbrium studies require \"young\" rocks and the investigators            will have access to a unique source in China.   Analysis will be                performed in both U.S. and Chinese laboratories thereby enabling                inter-laboratory calibration of samples.  Research results will                 advance understanding of the nature of recent volcanic eruptions in             northeast Asia (Japan, Korea and China) and its coupling to tectonic            activities in this region.  The combined efforts, complementary                 facilities of the Chinese and U.S. laboratories fulfill the                     principal objective of the U.S.-China program; which is, to advance             scientific knowledge through international collaboration.",
