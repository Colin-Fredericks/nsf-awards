 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between                          Prof. William J. Mullin of the University of                                    Massachusetts, Amherst, and Dr. Franck Laloe of the                             Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris, in the area of                                 quantum physics of polarized systems.  The goal of                              this research is to increase our understanding of                               fundamental processes  which are affected by strong                             polarization of electron spins.  Materials which                                exhibit such polarization, and hence whose properties                           are not completely described by classical physics,                              include gaseous hydrogen and certain isotopes of                                liquid and gaseous helium.  The effects of spin                                 polarization on atom-atom interactions in these                                 systems can be large if the polarizations are opposing                          in the interacting atoms.  These actions can lead to                            large effects on mean free paths, and hence on the                              measurable properties of pressure, thermal                                      conductivity, viscosity.  This theoretical study will                           involve investigation of possible extensions of the                             classical kinetic equation (which describes atomic                              motions in the system) to the quantum regime.  The                              study will also examine how the effects of strong                               polarizations can be incorporated into this                                     quantum-capable equation in a solvable manner. In                               addition, the possibility of seeking new experimental                           observations related to quantum effects in                                      spin-polarized systems will also be explored.                                                                                                                   The U.S. investigator has already performed                                     considerable research on solutions of the kinetic                               equation, and the French collaborator's previous                                experience with derivation of the collision                                     integral--the term which actually describes the atomic                          interactions--for the kinetic equation is                                       complementary.  The U.S. and French investigators will                          therefore benefit from joint efforts on this problem.                           The kinetic equation will be solved for measurable                              transport coefficients, such as heat conductivity and                           viscosity, if possible, and alternative modes of                                measurement of the transport coefficients of polarized                          helium gas isotopes will also be examined.  This work                           could have important benefits in the areas of                                   thermodynamics and cooling systems, superfluidity, and                          superconductivity.",
