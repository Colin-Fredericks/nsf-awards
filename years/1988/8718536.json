 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is becoming clear that many kinds of animals can distinguish                 between relatives and unrelated individuals.  Studies of kin                    recognition have emphasized how the behavior develops and the                   sensory mechanisms used in recognition (i.e., visual, auditory,                 chemical cues).  Although two basic functions of kin-recognition                behavior (inbreeding avoidance and ensuring that aid-giving                     behavior is directed toward relatives) are recognized, empirical                evidence as to the significance of kin-recognition behavior is                  lacking.  This is especially true for amphibian larvae, which                   have been the subjects of extensive research on kin recognition.                                                                                                Amphibian larvae are ideal subjects for studying kin-recognition                behavior because the behavior is easy to observe and to quantify,               experimental manipulation is possible, and detailed accounts of                 the natural history of the species are available.                                                                                                               Previous research on kin recognition in amphibian larvae has                    provided important information on the roles of learning and                     heredity in the development of the behavior.  Furthermore, past                 research has revealed that different species have different                     abilities to recognize kin.                                                                                                                                     Dr. Blaustein's research is designed to test hypotheses about the               adaptive value of kin-recognition behavior.  This aspect of the                 kin-recognition phenomenon is the least understood.  Both theory                and empirical evidence suggest that growth and development may be               influenced by the composition of the social group.  Past research               has shown that growth and development of insects and mammals are                influenced by the genetic composition of the animals within a                   group.  Therefore, Dr. Blaustein will test the influence of the                 genetic group composition on growth and development in Cascades                 frog tadpoles.  This species has the most sensitive kin-                        recognition system of any amphibian.  Dr. Blaustein predicts that               tadpoles living in groups composed primarily of kin will grow and               develop faster than those in groups composed of kin and non-kin.                This portion of the investigation should greatly enhance our                    knowledge of the kin-recognition phenomenon in general.                                                                                                         Observations in nature and laboratory experiments illustrate that               predation is one important selective force in the formation of                  animal groups.  This seems to be especially true for tadpoles.                  Therefore, Dr. Blaustein will conduct experiments dealing with                  the relationship between group formation and kin-recognition.  He               predicts that tadpoles will form groups composed primarily of kin               because when they release a chemical alarm substance, the animals               that are warned are nearby relatives.",
