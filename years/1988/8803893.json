 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building on his prior reconnaissance in the area, Dr. Deboer will               conduct two seasons of archaeological research in the Santiago                  and Cayapas basins of the Esmeraldas province in coastal Ecuador.               Although very little work has been done in this heavily vegetated               tropical region, Dr. Deboer's survey indicates the existence of                 six distinct archaeological complexes which appear to extend from               the first millennium B.C. to the recent past.  Because the ground               cover is so heavy, Dr. Deboer and his team will follow extant                   trails and use these as the basis for survey.  His assumption is                that such trails have great antiquity and thus, prior settlements               should be clustered along them.  He will also conduct excavation                at selected sites.                                                                                                                                              The goals of this research are to define these complexes more                   clearly, determine their chronology through pottery seriation and               radiocarbon dating, and to determine the geographical extent of                 each.  Dr. Deboer will then work to explicate settlement patterns               and social organization.  Some areas on the Pacific coast of                    South America have produced spectacular assemblages with                        monumental architecture, and these have been studied in some                    detail.  Other regions which did not reach this state of                        development are less known, and Esmeraldas is one of these.  Dr.                Deboer's survey and excavation will help fill this gap.  The                    research will serve to document the range of variation along the                Pacific coast and provide a broader interpretive context.                                                                                                       From a larger perspective the research is important because it                  will increase our understanding of human adaptation at a simple                 level of technology in the tropics.  In this heavily forested                   region, groups survived by simple agricultural techniques for                   over a thousand years.  The techniques they employed were thus                  successful over not only the short run, and it may be valuable                  both in Ecuador and other tropical regions of the world to learn                about them.",
