The objectives of this program are to provide                  research support to the Nation's most outstanding and promising                 young science and engineering faculty.  The awards are intended                 to improve the capability of U.S. academic institutions to                      respond to the demand for highly qualified science and                          engineering personnel for academic and industrial research and                  teaching.                                                                                                                                                       This award will allow the investigator to pursue his research in                the study of macroeconomics, financial economics, and applied                   econometrics.  There are several major broad research questions                 that are central to his research interests.  One issue is what                  determines long-term asset prices.  Another is what determines                  aggregate savings behavior.  A third question is what are the                   long-run implications of business cycle fluctuations.  All of                   these are extremely important areas for research with important                 policy implications for the U.S economy.",
