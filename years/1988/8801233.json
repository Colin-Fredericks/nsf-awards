 "awd_abstract_narration": "This analysis of the hydrographic structure of the Greenland Sea will           form an integral part of a year-long investigation of the Three-                dimensional Greenland Sea circulation using acoustic techniques.  It            also contributes to an international program of integrated oceanographic        research in the Norwegian and Greenland Seas whose objective is to              quantify the environmental effects that are active in the production of         intermediate and deep water masses.  The data base will be produced             through a series of oceanographic cruises, undertaken cooperatively with        West German, Norwegian, and Canadian oceanographers.  The Greenland Sea         is an important area for the production of intermediate and deep water          masses that sink and spread globally.  It is qualitatively understood           that the process of interior water mass formation is the result of              surface cooling and water column destabilization, but the deep                  convection events that must be part of the process have to this time not        been observed.  Acoustic oceanography, specially the year-long array of         acoustic moorings that will be set out in the Greenland Sea from 1988 to        1989, has the potential of making these observations, but requires              precise and accurate hydrographic information in order to interpret the         acoustic data and convert it to oceanographically useful information.",
