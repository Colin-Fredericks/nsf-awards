 "awd_abstract_narration": "The processes by which parents inculcate cultural values and                    behavioral norms has been the focus of scientific inquiry for                   decades.  Consequently, the family literature is replete with                   comparisons between different families in order to identify those               characteristics (e.g., ses, ethnicity, family composition,                      parenting style) which differentiate socialization outcomes in                  children.  Critical examination suggests, however, that this                    \"traditional\" focus may be misplaced, since variation in outcome                occurs largely within, rather than between, families.  Put                      another way, children from the same family are as different from                one another, in behavior. personality and intelligence, as are                  children from different families.                                                                                                                               One means by which we can understand differences within families                is to consider the \u001asocial constructions\u001a, (i.e., the meanings                  assigned to and interpretations made of interactions), that                     individual members bring to the socialization which takes place                 within the family context.  In this research each member (i.e.,                 individual parents and children) of 100, two.child nuclear                      families will participate in a series of questionnaires and                     individual interviews.  The principal investigator will obtain                  information regarding individual perceptions or constructions of                the family, its composite subsystems (i.e., the spousal                         relationships, the sibling relationship and parent.child                        relationships), and socialization.  Multivariate analyses will be               used to examine how individual perceptions of the family                        environment, including perceptions of within family subsystems                  (such as sibling and spousal relationships) differentiate the                   socialization outcomes for children in the same family.                                                                                                         The investigation will extend the existing literature on family                 socialization to consider the reciprocal influence of multiple                  family subsystems (i.e., parent.child relationships, the sibling                relationship, the spousal relationship), on individual perception               and experience of the family environment and socialization. It                  will provide a complement to observational and sociological                     studies of the family, by focussing on the psychological level at               which such processes occur.",
