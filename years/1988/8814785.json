The CBMS supporting                              services consist primarily of four kinds of annual                              activities: (1) assisting the National Science                                  Foundation in drafting and publicizing the announcement                         and guidelines for the Regional Conference proposals;                           (2) selecting and convening panels of experts to                                evaluate the proposals and make recommendations to the                          National Science Foundation; (3) providing an official                          observer to each regional conference to evaluate its                            degree of success and make recommendations for                                  improvement of future conferences; and (4) receiving and                        submitting to the National Science Foundation for                               approval, manuscripts of the conferences, and then                              arranging the publication of these manuscripts.  The                            regional research conferences survey current research                           topics in the mathematical sciences and provide for the                         exchange of scientific research related to the                                  conference focus.",
