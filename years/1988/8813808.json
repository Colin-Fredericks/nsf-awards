 "awd_abstract_narration": "Preliminary design is recognized as a vitally important                    but poorly understood engineering activity.  The primary                        objectives of this research are to provide an improved                          understanding of the use of interative processes for                            preliminary design and to facilitate the development of                         computer tools to support preliminary design activities.  The                   research focuses on the following three key issues: (1) the                     selection and representation of suitable features and other                     attributes describing partial design states, (2) the evaluation                 of partial designs, and (3) the generation of promising design                  actions.                                                                             The research approach involves the following four phases:                  (1) development of conceptual framework, (2) implementation of                  this framework in a knowledge-based design system, (3)                          computational explorations using this design system, and (4)                    organization, evaluation and generalization of results.  The                    research is expected to provide significant new insights                        strengthening the foundation of design theory, to support                       further research into improved processes for preliminary design                 and to support development of better computer aided design tools                for industry.",
