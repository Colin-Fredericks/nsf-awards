 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support a three-year study of plasma                            instabilities associated with magnetic pulsations in the                        magnetosphere.  The purpose of the study is to conduct data                     analyses, analytical calculations and computer simulations for a                better understanding of wave modes, generation mechanisms, field-               aligned mode structures and ion heating phenomena.  Wave                        excitation mechanisms for various wave modes including stormtime                Pc 5 waves and auroral hiss have been studied.  This study will                 focus on stormtime Pc 5 waves on the equatorial plane and Pc 3                  magnetic pulsations in the polar cusps.                                                                                                                         Stormtime Pc 5 waves are large amplitude quasi-sinusoidal                       magnetic field oscillations with period in the range of 150-500                 seconds.  One popular mechanism for explaining stormtime Pc 5                   waves is the drift mirror instability.  Recent study indicates                  that the instability condition for the drift mirror instability                 was not satisfied for one stormtime Pc 5 wave event.  This                      important result raises a fundamental question about the                        instability mechanism for stormtime Pc 5 waves.                                                                                                                 In addition, this grant will extend the investigation of magnetic               pulsations to other regions.  In particular, plasma instabilities               associated Pc 3 waves recently detected at mid-altitudes by DE-1                will be studied.  The free energy sources for cusp magnetic                     pulsations are not known and need to be examined theoretically.                                                                                                 One key element of the grant is that the observed distribution                  function will be used for investigating plasma instabilities                    associated with magnetic pulsations.  Spacecraft plasma data have               been obtained for that purpose.",
