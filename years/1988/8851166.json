 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to improve the undergraduate                    curriculum of the Biological and Environmental Sciences Department              through the acquisition of a scanning electron microscope (SEM).  The           SEM makes it possible to obtain valuable information about the external         and internal surface features of specimens and to provide students with         increased understanding of structure-function relationships at the              cellular level.  Since there is such a rapidly expanding body of                knowledge in the areas of cell biology and physiology, the Department           faced a growing need to update undergraduate courses to provide a sound         understanding of physiological processes at the cellular and                    subcellular levels.                                                                                                                                                  The SEM is being used in the following courses:  Techniques of             Electron Microscopy, Cell Ultrastructure, Cell Biology, Human                   Physiology, Microbiology, and Biological Research Investigations.  The          instrument has been attached to a VCR and TV monitor which extends its          instructional capabilities and makes it a uniquely flexible teaching            tool.  Biological specimens can be examined and videotaped, bringing            the actual \"search and discover\" process beyond the lab into the                classroom.  Ancillary equipment for the preparation of specimens (a             sputter coater and a critical point dryer) are included in the project.                                                                                              The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
