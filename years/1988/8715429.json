 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to formulate a methodology for early                post-earthquake damage detection for lifelines and to collect and               utilize field data from the September, 1975 Mexico earthquakes.                 Considerable data on water transmission system damage, as well as water         pressure gradient changes, were recorded by the General                         Directorate of Hydraulic Construction and Operations (D.D.F.) in                Mexico City.  These data can be used to help formulate an early                 post-earthquake damage detection methodology for lifelines.  This               methodology has the capability to preserve surviving storage                    supplies without having to cut off vital supplies to undamaged                  areas, and expedite and more effectively manage ensuing response                and recovery efforts.                                                                                                                                           Four major tasks are being addressed:  (1) Collect, review, and                 document water system performance data from the 1985 Mexico                     earthquakes, (2) Develop comprehensive earthquake vulnerability                 models for critical water system components, (3) Formulate an                   early post-earthquake damage detection methodology, and (4)                     Demonstrate this methodology for the September 1985 Mexico                      earthquakes.  The major emphasis is on tasks 2 and 3.",
