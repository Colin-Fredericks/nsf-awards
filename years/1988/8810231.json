 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates the cooling ability of grinding fluids               for both conventional and creep feed grinding conditions.  The                  objective is to analyze the convective heat transfer occurring at               the workpiece surface, and ultimately to predict the fraction of                the total grinding energy which remains in the workpiece, and the               workpiece temperature.  This experimental effort will address                   four measurements:  temperatures within the workpiece and at its                surface, the change in temperature of the grinding fluid, the                   grinding forces, and the grinding wheel topography.  This                       research, combined with a parallel modeling effort in another                   grant will permit a basic understanding of the thermal aspects of               grinding.                                                                                                                                                       Grinding accounts for about 20 percent of the machining                         expenditures in the United States, and is consequently of great                 industrial importance.  Energy generated during grinding may                    cause thermal damage the workpiece and wheel.  To avoid this,                   grinding fluids are often used, but their effects are not well                  understood.  The overall objective of the proposal is to                        investigate the cooling ability of grinding fluids for both                     conventional and creep feed grinding conditions so that a                       predictive model can be developed.",
