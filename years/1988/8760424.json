 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to investigate the technical                   feasibility of applying an electrochemical process to the in situ               dehalogenation of hazardous substances in soils contaminated by                 halogenated organic substances that leak from hazardous waste                   containment sites or enter groundwater as a consequence of                      accidental spills while substances are in transit.  In this                     project, halogenated organic substances will be subjected to an                 electrochemical process that will cause their dehalogenation.                   This will be done in the presence solvents which, if effective,                 would make it technically possible to remove the dehalogenated                  substances from soil contaminated by them.  A process to destroy                halogenated hazardous wastes in soils which is reliable, does not               permit release of possibly hazardous wastes, does not use                       reactive chemicals, and its low cost will have immediate                        application by both government and industry to clean-up landfills               and soils contaminated by leaks or spills.                                                                                                                      The proposal leading to this Phase I award was submitted and                    evaluated in accord with NSF 87-8, NSF Program Solicitation,                    Small Business Innovation Research.",
