 "awd_abstract_narration": "The properties of galaxies at distances of many billions of light               years are to be investigated.  Such galaxies are seen as they                   were at earlier stages of evolution and may reveal evolutionary                 effects.  Moreover, the curvature of the universe expands the                   apparent sizes of galaxy images to a detectable degree if the                   distance is great enough.  Progress in this field has been                      difficult because evolutionary, selection, and cosmological                     effects may be similar in appearance, and the accidental                        measurement errors of such faint sources may be large.  The                     existence of large-scale structure in the universe provides a                   rich new field for study, but complicates the definition of                     statistically fair samples.  The studies will feature the                       ultimate use of all practically accessible information for                      complete samples of distant galaxies, including the morphology                  and the internal kinematics.  The methodology will be explored                  first by making observations of nearby galaxies.  One telescope                 will be instrumented with an array detector sensitive to                        near-infrared light, and another telescope will be instrumented                 with an optical spectrograph.  The observations, carried out with               large telescopes to observe distant galaxies, will involve the                  use of the same infrared array detector for the purpose of making               precise photometric measurements.  An ongoing very faint redshift               survey will be expanded to map out large-scale structure in the                 universe at the greatest accessible distances.",
