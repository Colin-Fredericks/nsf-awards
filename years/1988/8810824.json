 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award is to develop a general framework for knowledge-                 based computer tools that aid simultaneous engineering in                       mechanical design.  Design Compatibility Analysis (DCA) will                    serve as the underlying concept for these knowledge-based                       systems.  DCA focuses on the compatibility between the design                   requirements (specification) and the proposed design, evaluates                 the design based on the compatibility knowledge of experts,                     gives justification for the evaluation and suggests                             improvements.  DCA accommodates a product's various life-cycle                  issues (e.g., functionality, manufacturability, reliability)                    with a unified focus, i.e., compatibility, and thus helps                       designers to incorporate these issues at the early stages of                    design representation.  The second focus is the linkage between                 DCA and analytical computer programs such as performance                        simulators.  The resulting framework will not only serve as the                 basis for various design expert systems, but will also enhance                  our understanding of the life-cycle design issues.",
