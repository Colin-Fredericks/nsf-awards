 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a conference on the sensory mechanisms by which                      microorganisms respond to their environments.  It is being held                 at the annual meeting of the International Society of Chemical                  Ecology and has among its major goals the introduction of                       chemical ecologists to the sensory biology of microbes.  This                   area is relatively unexplored by chemical ecologists.  Many of                  the leading investigators in microbial sensory biology are                      speaking at the conference and it is expected that the ecologists               and natural products chemists who makeup the majority of the                    Society of Chemical Ecology will begin to exchange ideas and,                   perhaps, enter into collaborations with their colleagues in this                allied area.  The ecology of microorganisms is important for a                  number of health, agricultural and industrial problems and                      bringing new expertise to bear on it can be expected to bring                   handsome long-term profits.",
