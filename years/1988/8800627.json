 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among the most significant questions concerning laws against               employment discrimination are the conditions under which                        employers are liable for sex-based wage discrimination when male                and female workers hold different jobs.  Much of the debate has                 centered on the concept of comparable worth, under which women                  claim legal entitlement to increased wages based on the evaluated               worth of their jobs compared to those of men, even though the                   market price of predominantly female jobs is less than that of                  predominantly male jobs.  Thus far, the courts and enforcement                  agencies largely have adopted the view that the wage differences                between predominantly male and female jobs primarily are the                    result of competitive labor market conditions and, as such, that                employers have relatively little discretion in (and relatively                  little responsibility for) setting male and female wage rates.                  There is considerable labor market research which suggests,                     however, that large segments of the work force are employed in                  firm-specific, internal labor markets or bureaucratic personnel                 systems where employers may retain substantial discretion in                    establishing pay levels, and the discretionary component of pay                 policies may systematically work to disadvantage jobs held                      predominantly by women.                                                              Drs. Nelson and Bridges seek to advance the empirical                      analysis of these issues through an intensive analysis of a set                 of Title VII cases that involved claims of between-job wage                     discrimination against women.  Considerations of inter-job labor                market decisions will provide the theoretical contrast for                      explaining different wages which are paid for predominantly male                and female jobs of comparable worth.  Using court records,                      interviews with those involved, and statistical and archival                    records on the firms involved and their external labor markets,                 the study will focus on the extent to which wages of large                      organizations are influenced by internal organizational factors                 rather than external market conditions, whether internal                        organizational factors have a depressive influence on female                    jobs, and whether courts have adequately considered the evidence                and empirical issues.                                                                This research is important from many theoretical                           perspectives.  Given the relative absence of research that                      directly examines the wage-setting practices of large                           organizations, this study will develop a more systematic                        empirical understanding of organizational pay systems.  It will                 lay the foundation for broader analyses of organizational wage                  systems and their impact on male-female earnings differences.  It               also will inspect a fundamental issue relating to equal                         opportunity and the doctrine of equal worth.  The results of the                research should have clear relevance to the development and                     application of antidiscrimination law.  Exploring these issues in               the context of completed cases may lead to a new perspective on                 the meaning of existing case law and to a more sophisticated                    approach to these empirical questions in future work.",
