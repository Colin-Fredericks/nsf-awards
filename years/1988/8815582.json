 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Combustion Institute International Symposium is a                           biennial event which brings together about one thousand                         specialists in the multifaceted field of Combustion.  This                      forum (and the subsequent proceedings) are a choice place for                   exchanging and recording the latest accomplishments in the                      field.  Thus it contributes to the diffusion of the results                     and ideas which evolve from the many awards granted by NSF in                   this area, as well as redefining the direction of their                         future work.  To be noted also is the massive participation                     of other nations, some of them extremely active in this field                   (Japan and Western Europe, in particular).                                                                                                                      The grant of $5000 to help the University of Washington host                    this important event is a worthwhile investment for the                         Foundation.",
