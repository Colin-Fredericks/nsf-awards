 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposed studies are designed to address four fundamental               questions concerning deep-sea hydrothermal vent and cold-water seep             environments:  (1) Are biological processes in these environments               relatively fast or relatively slow?  (2) How do the rates of                    biological processes vary among a wide variety of                               geographically-separated hydrothermal systems and, more                         generally, between deep-sea hydrothermal vent and cold-water seep               environments?  (3) How do the relatively sedentary organisms                    encountered at the vents and seeps disperse and subsequently locate             and colonize these apparently ephemeral and                                     geographically-separated environments?  and (4) What are the time               scales associated with vent and seep activity at particular sites               throughout the world's oceans?  Experiments will be deployed and                retrieved (and specimens sampled) using various deep-diving                     submersibles at six geographically-separated hydrothermal vent areas            (Galapagos Rift, 13'N, 21'N, Guaymas Basin, Juan de Fuca Ridge, and             Mid-Atlantic Ridge) and one cold-water seep environment (base of the            West Florida Escarpment).  Detailed comparisons will be made with               the experimental results obtained (and specimens at our disposal)               from previous hydrothermal vent and cold-water seep expeditions,                relying heavily upon mathematical techniques developed during the               course of our ongoing NSF-funded studies.  Results obtained from the            proposed studies should significantly increase our knowledge of both            temporal and spatial variability in rates of biological and                     geological processes within, among, and between deep-sea                        hydrothermal vent and cold-water seep environments.  Finally, the               proposed studies involve extensive collaborative efforts with                   French, Canadian and Mexican scientists which should represent a                significant step toward closer integration of the major hydrothermal            vent programs presently underway throughout the world's oceans.",
