 "awd_abstract_narration": "A workshop on Tissue Engineering is proposed for February 26-29, 1988,          to be held at the Granlibakken Conference Center in California.  The            participants will be limited to approximately 60, including 24 invited          speakers and discussants who have established programs in the field.            An additional 12-16 participants will be drawn from industry based on           responses from announcements sent to the research directors of 200              pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with possible activities in           the area.  An additional 10-12 participants will be drawn from                  agencies with programs that are related to the subject matter of the            workshop.                                                                                                                                                       The growth and maintenance of functional tissue for use in repair of            injured tissue, as a replacement for tissue loss in degeneration or as          a means of therapy where tissue implants can alleviate an adverse               medical condition is a rapidly evolving field.  The workshop will               evaluate the current status of research in this field over a range of           disciplines from fundamental cell biology to analytic engineering               approaches to production of tissue or materials useful in new tissue            induction.  The specific areas to be considered will include but not            be limited to cell biology and cell and tissue culture, developmental           physiology, surgical needs, skin replacements, vascular replacements,           microcirculation development including angiogenesis and angiogenic              factors, cartilage and bone, muscle including cardiac muscle and                pancreas and kidney.  The workshop will consist of a short opening              session followed by two complete days of sessions, and discussion               summaries, will be published within 6 months of the workshop as part            of the series:  UCLA Symposia in Molecular and Cellular Biology.  This          will make the content of the meeting generally accessible to the                community.  Drafts of session summary discussions and a recorded tape           of the discussions will be sent to the sponsoring agency immediately            after the workshop.",
