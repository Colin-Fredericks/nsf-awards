 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many developing organisms differentiation is regulated by                interactions between neighboring cells although the mechanism is not            known for any organism.  The goal of this study is to isolate the               components of a cell interaction system which regulates gene expression         and differentiation during the developmental cycle of the myxobacterium         Myxococcus xanthus.  The spoC locus is involved in the production of an         intercellular signal, the SpoC signal, which is necessary for the               transcription of specific developmental (SpoC-dependent) genes.  This           proposal contains three lines of investigation which deal with different        aspects of the signaling process.  First, the protein product of the            spoC locus will be purified by immunoaffinity chromatography.  The              cellular location of this protein will be determined by western                 blotting, and a bioassay will be developed for the protein.  Second,            several SpoC-dependent promoters will be cloned.  The nucleotide                sequences responsible for their regulation will be identified by DNA            sequencing, deletion analysis and mutagenesis.  Finally, another genetic        locus, which has been shown to modulate expression of SpoC-dependent            genes, will be isolated by molecular cloning, and SpoC-dependent                promoters in a positive or negative manner.                                         The simple micro-organism, Myxococcus xanthus, provides an excellent        model system in which to study the control of a developmental program by        cell interactions.  It provides a system in which genetic studies can be        coupled with studies of cell surface interactions in a developing               system.",
