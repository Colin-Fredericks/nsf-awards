 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gas Chromatography is being integrated across the curriculum with the           concepts, practice and specialized uses of modern separations                   technology being employed.  Significant improvement in the laboratory           component of the curriculum is resulting with the introduction of both          general purpose and research grade GC instruments.  Three general               purpose GC instruments have been purchased in order to introduce                chromatography concepts to General Chemistry students.  They are being          used as an integral part of sample analysis in the Organic Chemistry            laboratory and as a quantitative analysis tool for the Analytical               Chemistry laboratory.  A research grade capillary GC coupled with a             chromatography workstation and a purge and trap analyzer has been               purchased for use in the Advanced Analytical and Organic, Physical,             Inorganic, and Individual Research courses.  Efficient GC separations,          computer collection and manipulation of data, and the ability to study          a wide variety of samples utilizing purge and trap techniques is                allowing new, relevant laboratory experiences to be offered to                  chemistry majors, and is enhancing student research capabilities.
