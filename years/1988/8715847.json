 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ions move across cell membranes through microscopic water-filled                pores in large protein molecules referred to as ion channels.                   Such channels are characterized by their selectivity for a                      particular ion, mode of opening and closing - gating, and by the                nature of agents that block them.  This project focuses on                      understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying channel gating                in an invertebrate model system, the giant axon from the marine                 worm Myxicola infundibulum, for both voltage-activated NA+                      channels and voltage-activated K+ channels.  In addition to using               specific drugs to separate and probe ion channels function, three               different electrophysiological techniques are used: (1) recording               square millimeters by high-resolution, conventional voltage-                    clamp; (2) examining intramembrane charge movements producing the               small \"gating currents\" that apparently initiate opening of ion                 channels; and (3) investigating the opening and closing of single               ion channels by isolating a few square microns of the axon                      membrane with a glass micropipette - called \"patch clamp\".  A                   full understanding of the molecular operation of ion requires the               simultaneous application of all these techniques because each                   yields different information.  Experimental results will combine                with theoretical analysis to develop a detailed, testable model                 of ion channel function.",
