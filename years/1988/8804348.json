 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this grant are to locate functionally the                     transcription termination signal(s) of the galactose operon of E.coli;          to determine the nucleotide sequence of the signal(s); to assay the             efficiency of termination of signal(s); if more than one signal is              found, to study the relationship of the signals; and to compare the             signal(s) to ones previously characterized.  Since preliminary studies          suggest the possibility of an as yet uncharacterized gene on the                galactose operon, a further objective is to determine if such a gene            exists.  Sections of DNA generated from restriction enzyme digests will         be inserted into a plasmid (pKG) developed for assaying transcription           termination efficiency.  Once the transcription termination signal(s)           is/are functionally located, the nucleotide sequence of the                     termination region will be determined.  In the event multiple                   transcription termination signals are discovered, their relationships           in termination efficiency will be studied using the pKG plasmid.  The           possibility of an uncharacterized gene on this operon will be explored          by inserting sections of DNA containing open reading frames into                plasmids developed to generate proteins.  The proteins will be injected         into rabbits, which will produce antibodies against the proteins.  The          antibodies will then be used to probe E.coli proteins to determine if           such a protein exists.                                                                                                                                          The project is significant in contributing to an understanding of the           role of transcription termination in the regulation of gene                     expression.",
