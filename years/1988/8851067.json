 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Claremont Science and Mathematics Collaborative, a partnership of           the Claremont Graduate School, local industrial leaders, expert pre-            college science and mathematics teachers, and area school districts,            will develop and operate a program to facilitate mid-career moves into          teaching by industry scientists and engineers.  With the cooperation of         their managements, experienced technical graduates in industry who are          interested in entering science and mathematics teaching will be                 recruited into a special program of the Claremont Teacher Education             Internship Program.  Here they will initially spend one summer in on-           campus courses and orientation at Claremont, then one year in a school          teaching full time with the support and guidance of a master-teacher            mentor, and then one more summer on campus.  They can then be certified         for teaching in California, and with an additional eight credits they           can receive a Master of Arts in Teaching degree.  Transition financial          support for the participants will be provided by their industrial               employers, the Claremont Graduate School, and the National Science              Foundation.  Industry support will be developed and coordinated by the          Technology Exchange Center, an existing organization of local industry,         education, and government leaders.                                                                                                                              Cost sharing by the partners will total 60% of the NSF funding.",
