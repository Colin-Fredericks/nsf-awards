Its representation of the                Eastern Pacific marine fauna is the most complete in existence                  and has been used by all modern workers studying the region.                    Additionally, the collection is strong in small-sized species                   worldwide and has significant holdings of non-marine mollusks.                       Previous awards have allowed the collection to begin                       computerizing its holdings.  Locality data from a total of nearly               8,000 stations from fully documented expedition sources have been               standardized and entered into the computer.                                          The current project has five major objectives:  1) Expansion               and rearrangement of the marine reference collection to integrate               the three regional collections into a single systematically-                    arranged collection.  2) Curation of the newly acquired                         collection of Recent mollusks from the University of California                 at Los Angeles.  3) Curation of a large survey collection made                  off southern California under the auspices of the Bureau of Land                Management.  4) Computer entry of data for specimens in the type                collection.  5) Continuation of support for visiting                            investigators who will examine and re-arrange portions of the                   collection.",
