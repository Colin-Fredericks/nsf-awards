 "awd_abstract_narration": "The northern Alaskan landscape includes a diverse mosaic of                ecosystem types that differ greatly in their vegetation, their                  soils, and their element cycling patterns.  This investigation                  will evaluate some of the important controls and implications of                this biogeochemical diversity, using a toposequence of six                      contrasting ecosystems in the Sagavanirktok River valley as the                 study site.  The first major goal of the project is to describe                 how individual ecosystems vary in their contributions to the                    overall patterns of storage and turnover of nitrogen, phosphorus                and organic matter in the Arctic landscape as a whole.  The                     approach to this goal is budget-oriented, using a conceptual                    model of N and P cycling along a toposequence to help compare and               contrast the relative importance of major processes in different                ecosystems, and to sum up over the whole toposequence.                          Particular emphasis is placed on the importance of element                      outputs from one ecosystem to the productivity and nutrient                     dynamics of its neighbors.  The second goal is to understand how                the biogeochemical effects of disturbance are propagated, both                  within a single ecosystem type and along a heterogeneous                        toposequence.  A series of field and laboratory experiments will                be combined with simulation modeling and tracer studies.                             Substantial progress has been made toward resolution of                    major questions in terms of acquisition of data.  As a next                     logical phase the project group will maintain experiments already               in place while concentrating on producing major first-order                     publications.                                                                        The work is important because the Alaskan Arctic is under                  heavy development pressure, yet the long-term and cumulative                    impacts of this development are not well understood.  Most                      research so far has focused on single ecosystem types that occupy               large areas but are not necessarily representative of the range                 of biogeochemical diversity on the North Slope, or of the                       ecosystem types most frequently disturbed.  Although it is known                that disturbance effects spread slowly over the Arctic landscape,               very little is known about factors controlling their rate of                    spread and ultimate extent.  This research will result in                       increased understanding of controls on rate of spread of                        disturbance in single tundra ecosystems and the overall tundra                  landscape.",
