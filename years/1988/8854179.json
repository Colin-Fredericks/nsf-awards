 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Community College Summer Workshop in Modes of Programming will              provide community college instructors in Washington State who teach             computer science and related disciplines with active experience with            new models of computer problem solving that are supported by high-level         languages or established software packages of high-level building               blocks.  The specific topics are                                                Expert Systems Programming, Fourth Generation Language Programming,             Graphics Programming and Object Oriented Programming.  Both the                 selection of topics and approach are designed to support curricular             evolution in the community colleges by providing exposure to material           which, though advanced, can be integrated into the community college            computing curriculum.                                                                                                                                           In addition to NSF support, participants will contribute approximately          an additional 15% toward the costs of the program.",
