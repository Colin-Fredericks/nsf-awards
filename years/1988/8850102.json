 "awd_abstract_narration": "The School of Science and Technology of Jackson State University will           sponsor a Future Scientist Program for high potential secondary school          students.  The purpose of the program is to motivate young men and              women toward research and teaching careers in science and mathematics.          The program will include a residential summer enrichment program of six         weeks at Jackson State University and follow-up activities involving            the participants and their high school science teachers in the                  development of science projects during the academic year.  The majority         of participants will be Black students from the public high schools of          Mississippi.                                                                                                                                                    The summer program activities will include an interdisciplinary study           of the atmosphere and climate through classroom and laboratory                  activities and field trips, focusing on the disciplines of chemistry,           biological science, atmospheric science, mathematics and computer               science. The ethical aspects of the problems involved in the                    interaction between man and the atmosphere will be examined.  There             will also be career exploration activities and close interaction with           practicing scientists at Jackson State University and at cooperating            agencies, industries and research laboratories.                                                                                                                 The participants will develop plans for projects, related to the focus          of the summer program, which can be carried out in their home schools           during the academic year.  Program staff will work with the students            and their local high school science teachers in the implementation of           the projects.",
