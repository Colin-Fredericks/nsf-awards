 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal objective of this multi-institutional and                         international project is the reconstruction of a 2,000-year                     paleoclimatic record with high temporal resolution (annual to                   decadal) for the southern Antarctic Peninsula.  The Antarctic                   Peninsula region exhibits two distinctly different climatic                     regimes.  Therefore, three different drilling sites (200-3000m                  cores) are selected to provide information about both climatic                  regimes.                                                                                                                                                        The paleoclimatic reconstruction is part of an ongoing                          comprehensive research program designed to assess the temporal                  synchroneity and characteristics of the most recent Neoglacial                  (Little Ice Age) event as it is preserved within ice cores at                   various latitudes.  Establishing the link between climatic                      variations from low latitudes and from the polar regions will                   facilitate interpretation of globally significant fluctuation                   within the longer climatic records.  These ice cores may provide                further documentation and details of the mechanics of the El                    Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events.  The Antarctic Peninsula               is one of the key sites for global climatic and environmental                   reconstruction from ice cores and is a necessary link between the               ice core record from the interior of Antarctica and South America.              This project is undertaken in cooperation with the British                      Antarctic Survey and the University of Washington.",
