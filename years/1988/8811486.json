 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major goal of behavioral neuroscience research is the                         identification of the neurobiological processes which underlie                  learning and memory.  One important model system for examining                  experience-based changes in neuronal activity is long-term                      potentiation, or LTP.  This is a relatively long-lasting change                 in the efficiency of synapses, which results from stimulation                   with a brief, high frequency train of weak electrical pulses.                   This form of \"neuronal plasticity\" was first discovered in the                  hippocampal formation, a brain region known to be involved in                   memory formation.  Dr. Rose' recent work has shown that by using                a pattern of electrical stimulation which mimics either of two                  prominent electrophysiological activity patterns of the                         hippocampus (complex spike discharge and theta rhythm), he could                markedly reduce the threshold for inducing LTP.  This effect,                   termed \"primed burst\" (PB) potentiation, is invoked quite                       reliably by as few as five appropriately patterned stimuli.                     Because of its low threshold, and of its similarity to well-known               electrical activity patterns, it is proposed that a PB-like                     process may occur within the hippocampus during the formation of                new memories.                                                                                                                                                   Dr. Rose is recording electrophysiological activity from the                    hippocampi of normal, awake rats to evaluate this hypothesis.                   This work is clarifying both the physiological and behavioral                   conditions which promote PB potentiation, thus suggesting their                 role in the learning process.  He is also examining the                         correlation between PB potentiation and memory by examining the                 effects of stress and aging (two conditions known to impair                     mnemonic function) upon the capacity of hippocampal synapses to                 show this PB effect.",
