The recent develop-                   ment of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has excited                         widespread interest among the scientific community.  The atomic                 resolution imaging capabilities of this microscopy are having                   an impact in many fields.  This instrumentation provides atomic                 level spatial resolution of surface electronic structure,                       forces, and other surface and interfacial properties.  Such a                   tool can be expected to have great impact in many fields of                     science and to find use in many laboratories.  Many STM                         instruments are designed and fabricated by individual research                  groups and commercial products based on these individual                        designs are beginning to appear.  Major costs associated with                   the STM result from development time rather than equipment                      cost.  The opportunity exists for scientists to curtail                         duplication of effort by specifying the performance of STM                      instrumentation for general purpose research use.  The                          objectives of the workshop are to define specifications for a                   modular, generic STM instrument and to stimulate commercial                     interest in such a generic instrument.  The prospect for                        multiple purchase of generic STM's will also be explored.",
