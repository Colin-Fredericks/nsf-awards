 "awd_abstract_narration": "The treatment of wastes on a nuclear level and transforming them into           safer isotopes by selectively irradiating the wastes with a variety of          particles including neutrons, protons, and beta and alpha particles is          investigated.  The goal is to significantly reduce the number of                certain isotopes that present the most severe biological hazards.               Among these are cesium and iodine which, when collected, remain in the          human body and the transuranic elements are not only radioactive but            highly toxic.                                                                                                                                                   The investigation involves mathematical modeling of the transmutation           of isotopes under irradiation.  The model includes all isotopes found           in high level waste under all forms of irradiation.  The process is             repeated for all possible resulting products through any series of              transmutation.  A computer code is to be developed to solve                     simultaneously all of the coupled levels of the irradiating particles           and the duration of the irradiation.  The code is utilized to achieve           a series of irradiations by the various particles at feasible flux              levels yielding the desired result.",
