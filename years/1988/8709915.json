 "awd_abstract_narration": "These studies of the global regulatory circuitry for the                        glucose response have led to the identification of a gene                       (SNF3) from yeast that is essential for high-affinity glucose                   transport.  It has been cloned and the sequence analysis                        indicates that it encodes a membrane protein with homology to                   a major human glucose transporter.  Thus, the evidence                          indicates that the SNF3 gene encodes a glucose transport                        protein.  SNF3 is the first glucose transporter gene                            identified in yeast.  The structure, regulation and function                    of this gene and its protein product will be studied using                      the powerful genetic and molecular techniques available in                      yeast.  The objective is to understand the role of the SNF3                     protein in the response to glucose availability.%%%                                                                                                             The analysis of a yeast glucose transporter will lead to an                     understanding of mechanisms by which eukaryotic cells respond                   to changes in glucose availability.  This laboratory has                        carried out a genetic and molecular genetic analysis of the                     glucose regulatory response in yeast (Saccharomyces                             cerevisiae).  This organism was chosen to study because the                     genetics of this small eukaryote is highly developed.                           Thus biochemical and molecular methods, and also very                           powerful genetic approaches can be brought to bear on the                       problem.  Studies in recent years have shown that yeast                         shares many of the key features of higher eukaryotic cells;                     thus, much of what is learned will also apply to mammalian                      cells.***",
