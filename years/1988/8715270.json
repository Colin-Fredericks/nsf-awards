 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Donald Kyhos of the University of California at Davis                  will supervise graduate student Bruce Baldwin in a study of the                 evolutionary relationships of the Hawaiian silversword plants and               their western U.S. allies, the \"tarweed\" group of the sunflower                 family. Emphasis is placed on molecular-level compari-                          sons of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) among a large number of species                 in this group, to detect mutational differences between species                 and infer their phylogenetic connections. The tarweed group is of               great evolutionary interest because it comprises two very                       isolated elements: the Hawaiian \"silversword\" alliance of 26                    species and the western North American tarweeds. The growth forms               and physiology of the Hawaiian species have evolved dramatically,               although breeding barriers between even the most divergent                      species (woody trees and herbaceous rosettes) are weak. In                      contrast, the continental tarweeds are conservative in structure                and form, yet they have developed strong genetic barriers to                    interbreeding.                                                                       Study of this contrasting pattern of island versus mainland                evolution in plants at the DNA level, the level of the gentic                   code, offers great promise for resolving several problems. These                include resolution of the phylogenetic connections among the                    species, determination of the pattern of colonization among the                 Hawaiian taxa and of the role of hybridization in species                       formation, and measurement of the relative rates of change in DNA               and in morphological form.",
