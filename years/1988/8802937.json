 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will continue theoretical modeling of stellar                 atmospheres with mass loss.  The emphasis rests on very luminous                and massive stars, typically over 40 solar masses.  Accurate line               spectra are needed to obtain effective temperatures.  Such                      detailed understanding of the spectra yields information not only               about the causes of the winds but also about properties of                      stellar evolution, such as convection; ways to identify the                     luminosities of such stars in distant galaxies; and the effects                 on the interstellar medium.                                                                                                                                     The hottest observable stars provide important tests of our                     understanding of stellar evolution, they energize the                           interstellar medium; and they may become accurate indicators of                 distances of distant galaxies.  However, observations of hot                    stars can be interpreted reliably only after a detailed model of                their atmospheres has been constructed.  The model must include                 information on both the velocities of the winds leaving the stars               and on the atoms in the winds that absorb and re-emit the stellar               radiation.  Such a computation has only recently become possible.               The investigators are at the forefront of this research.  This                  grant will allow them to model the stellar atmospheres so that                  the spectra of the hottest stars can indeed become effective                    tools for astronomical research.",
