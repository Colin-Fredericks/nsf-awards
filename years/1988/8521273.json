 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a need for more efficient water heating and space                      conditioning of both residence and commercial buildings.                        Existing electric heat pumps are available but their coefficients               of performance are low.  An absorption heat pump is an alternate                device with a coefficient of performance that is almost double                  that of an electric heat pump.                                                                                                                                  This proposed effort seeks to demonstrate the technical and                     economic feasibility of a new abosrption heat-pumped water                      heater.  A new working fluid has been developed with distinct                   advantages over other fluids for heat pumps.  Energy, corrosion                 and cycle studies, including both experiments and analyses, will                be conducted and the economic viability will be assessed.  If                   successful, this work will result in significant energy savings.",
