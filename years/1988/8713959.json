 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Professor Frank P. Conte of Oregon State                 University to collaborate with Dr. Michael C. Geddes at the                     University of Adelaide, Australia.  These investigators will                    make physiological and biochemical comparisons on the                           halotolerant brine shrimp that inhabit alkaline and acidic                      saline lakes in Western Australia.  The enzyme complements                      responsible for cross-membrane transport of ions in the two                     environmental types of organisms will be isolated, purified and                 characterized in order to determine whether there has been                      genetic modification of the sodium pump.  The validity of a                     proposed carbon dioxide-dependent pathway for the production of                 auxiliary energy needed in osmoregulation will be tested by                     determining whether or not brine shrimp from acidic environments                have a particular enzyme critical to the pathway.  Additionally,                ecological studies will be conducted to determine the food                      resources and feeding behavior of the brine shrimp in the acid                  and alkaline lakes.                                                                                                                                             The purpose of this research is to gain insight into the                        molecular evolution occurring in cellular ion transport                         mechanisms.  Such adaptations are essential to the survival of                  organisms in hypersaline environments.  Dr. Conte is an expert                  on the physiology of halotolerance.  Dr. Geddes has had                         extensive experience with saline lakes and the physiology of the                Australian brine shrimp, and was one of the original discoverers                of the acid brine shrimp locations.  The presence of similar                    species in contrasting environments within close proximity                      provides an excellent opportunity for this comparative study.",
