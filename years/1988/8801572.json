 "awd_abstract_narration": "For 25 years, indirect evidence has been accumulating that animals              produce a hormone that can reduce blood presure by prompting the                dilation of blood vessels and the excretion of salt and water by the            kidneys.  In the past 7 years it has become apparent that the heart             itself can secrete such a hormone, and it has now been determined that          the hormone is a peptide containing 28 amino acids.  The hormone,               atriopeptin, affects vascular resistance and kidney excretion both              directly and indirectly, via inhibition of other hormones.  Fish face           chronic salt and water loads because their body fluids are more or less         concentrated than sea water or fresh water repectively.  The organs             involved in maintaining a relatively constant salt and water content of         the blood include the kidney, the gills, the gut, and the urinay                bladder.  Our hypothesis is that the ability of fish to maintain this           homeostasis (osmoregulation) when presented with varying environmental          salinities (euryhalinity) is dependent upon an atriopeptin from the             heart.  It is the intent of our study to extract and purify this                putative fish atriopeptin, determine if immunoreactive atriopeptin is in        the blood, heart and brain of various species, and if its amount changes        with alteration of environmental salinity.  Our reseasrch will give some        insight into the evolution of structure and the function of this                important vasoactive peptide.",
