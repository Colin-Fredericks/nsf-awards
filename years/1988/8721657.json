 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program is in the general area of organometallic                      chemistry. The research is concerned with the planned synthesis                 of new types of stacked organometallic complexes (multiligand                   sandwich compounds) and metal-boron-carbon clusters. Such                       extended sandwich systems in which electrons are delocalized                    over a large number of atoms are of interest as potential                       precursors to novel low-dimensional electrical conductors or                    semiconductors wherein the current flows only parallel to the                   chain. An important aim of the research is to discover new                      materials with unusual electronic properties.                                                                                                                   The principal building blocks which will be used to synthesize                  new extended sandwich systems are carboranes, paramagnetic                      transition metal ions, and polycyclic arenes. These will be                     combined in complexes having two or more metal centers and                      designed to favor delocalization of electrons between the                       metals. The new complexes will be characterized by multinuclear                 NMR, infrared, electron spin resonance and mass spectroscopy,                   as well as by X-ray crystallography, where feasible. Detailed                   electrochemical studies will be conducted on several families                   of these compounds. Small carborane ligands will be combined                    with diborolene units to create novel mixed-ligand sandwich                     species which may be used to construct large multilevel                         sandwich systems of a novel type, and which also may undergo                    oxidative ligand fusion to generate new classes of carbon-rich                  carboranes. Attempts will be made to also synthesize                            (carborane)metal(metallacycle) and (carborane)metal(borazine)                   complexes, types of compounds which are presently unknown, and                  to attempt linkage or fusion between the ligands.",
