 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor Eric Kaler of the University of               Washington in collaborative work with Professor Jorge Puig of the               University of Guadalajara, Mexico.  The investigators plan to                   investigate the structure and dynamics of microemulsions, using                 scattering techniques, transient and steady state fluorescence                  spectroscopy, pulsed field gradient nmr, and conductivity.                      Building on previously funded work, the researchers will                        investigate microemulsions formed with three, four, and five                    components, focusing on the transition from liquid-crystalline to               microemulsion phases.                                                                                                                                           Microemulsions are thermodynamically stable, isotopic                           microstructured fluid phases containing substantial amounts of oil              and water, surfactant, and, frequently, alcohol.  Because of their              unusual physico-chemical properties and their potential for                     large-scale applications of commercial importance, such as                      detergency, enhanced oil recovery, phase-transfer catalysis, and                photochemical and polymerization reactions, microemulsions have                 become increasingly important as a research area.  Yet, although                more than four decades have elapsed since their discovery, their                microstructure and changes in these structures are still not well               understood.  Using a systematic combination of several experimental             methods, some to be carried out in Washington, others in                        Guadalajara, the investigators hope to arrive at a more acurate                 understanding of microemulsion structure.  Knowledge of these                   structures will allow better designs of microemulsion based                     processes and more effective formulations of appropriate                        microemulsions for applications.",
