 "awd_abstract_narration": "The plant growth substance abscisic acid plays an important                     role in plants in several physiological processes, such as                      responses to environmental stresses, seed maturation and                        dormancy, and membrane transport.  Abscisic acid reduces                        water losses from plants by causing stomatal closure, while                     at the same time stimulating water uptake by the roots.                         During water stress the level of abscisic acid in leaves                        increases dramatically.  To understand the physiological role                   of abscisic acid, it is important to know how plants control                    their levels of abscisic acid.                                                                                                                                  This project deals with the biosynthesis and degradation of                     abscisic acid.  The proposed research is based on the                           hypothesis that abscisic acid is a degradation product of                       certain xanthophylls with xanthoxin as an intermediate, and                     that the oxidative degradation of carotenoids is the step in                    the pathway that is stimulated by dehydration.  Objectives                      are 1) to obtain conclusive evidence that abscisic acid is a                    degradation product of carotenoids and is not synthesized                       directly from mevalonic acid, as are certain sesquiterpenoid                    stress metabolites; 2) to determine which carotenoid is                         oxidatively degraded to abscisic acid; 3) to find out which                     steps are involved in the conversion of xanthoxin to abscisic                   acid by the use of mutants; 4) to develop a cell-free system                    for oxidative cleavage of xanthophylls that is relevant to                      the stress-induced abscisic acid production, and 5) to study                    in vitro how the hydroxylation of abscisic to phaseic acid is                   regulated.  Once the pathway to abscisic acid has been worked                   out, it will be possible to find out how a water deficit                        plant stimulates biosynthesis, and how restoration of turgor                    causes rapid breakdown of abscisic acid.  These studies are                     therefore of interest in connection with the response of                        plants to water deficits.***",
