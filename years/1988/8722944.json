 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry, broadly defined.  The thrust of this experimental                    activity is an investigation of approaches to extracting                        molecular functional group information from infrared spectra and                presenting this information as auditory patterns, primarily for                 the benefit of visually impaired scientists.  These investigators               have previously developed several schemes for presenting tabular                and graphical data as electronic music and now seek to extend                   that work to develop methods that can be used to assist in the                  detailed analysis of infrared spectra.  A central feature of this               project will be the use of chemometric techniques to select                     features from infrared spectra which can distinguish organic                    functional groups and present these features as auditory patterns               that will enable a listener to discern whether or not certain                   functional groups are likely to be present in a particular                      molecule.  An essential part of this research will be the                       determination of the features of the spectra to be used for                     generating the sound patterns.                                                                                                                                  This research has broad applications to chemistry and other                     experimental fields in science and engineering.  Additionally,                  this project is important to Foundation activities in both the                  Science and Engineering Education and Computer and Information                  Science and Engineering Directorates.  The techniques to be                     developed in this research could be useful to sighted as well as                to visually impaired scientists.",
