 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Dr. Nasser Peyghambarian and Dr. Stephen W.              Koch.  University of Arizona, to collaborate with Dr. Hartmut Haug,             University of Frankfurt, Federal Republic of Germany.  They are                 carrying out experimental and theoretical studies of quantum                    confinement effects and short pulse phenomena in semiconductor                  micro-structures.  Experimental work will include a study of the                dynamics of highly excited semiconductors and semiconductor                     micro-structures using femtosecond laser excitation.  They will                 induce gaps in semiconductor bands with light, and they will measure            the evolution of the spectral hole and carrier thermalization                   process.  They will also investigate nonlinear optical properties of            semiconductor quantum-dots using semiconductor micro-crystallite                doped glasses and etched micro-structures.  The researchers'                    theoretical studies will examine the linear and nonlinear optical               properties of semiconductor micro-structures and analyze quantum                confinement effects.  They will also study coherent processes and               high-field effects in semiconductors with non-equilibrium Green                 functions and quantum-mechanical rate theories.  They will                      investigate ac-Stark splitting of semiconductor bands caused by a               strong external field and they will compute the dynamics of the                 nonequilibrium carrier distribution.                                                                                                                            A semiconductor under strong optical excitation is an ideal system              to study nonlinear and non equilibrium processes of high current                interest in solid state physics.  The purpose of the research is to             study the basic phenomena associated with nonlinear interactions                between light waves and a variety of materials, most notably                    semiconductors with reduced space dimensions.  Dr. Peyghambarian has            done many of the experimental studies relevant to this research using           a state of the art femtosecond laser system in his laboratory.  Dr.             Koch and Dr. Haug provide strong complementary theoretical expertise            for the collaboration.  The research is important for understanding             fundamental physical phenomena which have potential applications in             optical signal processing.",
