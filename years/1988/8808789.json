 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research considers the rapid thermal annealing of ion-                     implanted silicon wafers with incoherent light.  Thermal modeling               of the transient heat transfer and the thermoelastic stresses of                the thermally activated annealing processes will be performed.                  The analytical modeling considers the two-dimensional                           contributions, the moving boundary at the amorphous-crystalline                 interface due to the solid phase epitaxy, and the variations of                 the optical and thermal physical properties.  A finite-difference               numerical program will be developed to solve the mathematical                   model.  The computer-aided analysis will broaden the applications               to more specific and complex systems.  An experimental                          investigation will also address the annealing process.  The data                will be useful for the validation and improvement of analytical                 and numerical models.                                                                                                                                           Rapid thermal annealing is a new and promising technology related               to IC wafer fabrication the VLSI applications in the semiconductor              industry.  The proposed research will provide a systematic thermal              analysis for ion-implanted semiconductors during rapid thermal                  annealing processes by incoherent light.  The results may improve the           understanding of the heat transfer mechanism and the thermal stresses           induced during the thermally activated processes.  The success of this          research can lead to high quality semiconductors produced in an energy          efficient method with high reproducibility.",
