 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of learning and memory are often performed using young                  adult animals as laboratory models of human learning.  These                    investigations, however, do not address one of the major factors                influencing memory:  Aging.  Dr. Gallagher's research focuses on                providing a more complete description of learning ability in                    animals toward the end of their normal lifespan.  Rodents are the               ideal subjects in which to study age-related memory changes,                    because we can observe mild-to-severe memory impairments over the               relatively short period (in human terms) of two to three years.                                                                                                 In her previous work, Dr. Gallagher has developed a series of                   memory tests which clearly expose performance differences between               young and aged animals.  These tests, furthermore, are capable of               distinguishing those behaviors which depend upon the integrity of               certain identified brain regions, and those which do not.                                                                                                       Dr. Gallagher will conduct several experiments to extend these                  findings, and will begin examining the extent to which each of                  these behavioral tasks depends upon a specific neurotransmitter                 system (acetylcholine) being intact.  Specifically, she will                    determine the relationship between changes in behavioral                        capacities and the effects of training on acetylcholine function                in aged animals.  These results will address the hypothesis that                altered learning and memory function in normal aging animals is                 associated with a change in the functional status of the basal                  forebrain cholinergic system.  Knowledge about relationships                    between learning and memory and the status of a specific brain                  system during aging will provide a more complete understanding of               progressive memorial deficits occurring over the lifespan.",
