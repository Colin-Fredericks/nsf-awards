 "awd_abstract_narration": "Immortal antibody producing hybridomas are produced by the fusion of            antibody producing spleen cells with myeloma cells. The widely used             chemical fusion procedures are time intensive, require large amounts of         valuable antigen and provide relatively low yields of the desired               hybridomas.  Conventional chemical fusion results in the random                 generation of hybridomas, most of which are not producing the desired           antibodies.  This proposal is directed towards the development of methods       which will add antigen specificity to the cell fusion process.  Myeloma         cells are first coated with the antigen (or hapten).  These labeled cells       are then incubated with spleen cells from an immunized mouse, whereupon         they bind to complementary antibody. Fusion between the two cells can           then be intiated either chemically or by electrofusion.  Results from the       Phase I project have indicated that:  1) It is possible to label the            surface of myelome cells with haptens or antigens, 2) Under proper              conditions, the labeled cells are viable, 3) Upon incubation with spleen        cells, surface labeled myeloma cells can find complementary lymphocytes         by molecular cell selection, and 4) The targeted myeloma.lymphocyte             dimers can be fused to yield hybridomas.  It was also demonstrated that         high speed flow cytometry provides a sensitive method for monitoring            these processes. Now that feasibility has been demonstrated, Phase II           would provide support to investigate optimal conditions for producing           hybridomas via targeted electrofusion.                                                                                                                          The PI wishes to exploit the technique of targeted cell electrofusion for       more efficient hybridoma production.  Conventional chemical cell fusions        result in random generation of hybridomas, most of which are not                producing the desired antibody.  The PI here proposes to exploit the            antigen.binding properties of B.lymphocytes to increase the specificity         of the cell fusion process. This would overcome an important limitation         to the commercialization of custom hybridoma production.",
