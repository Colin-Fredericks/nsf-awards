 "awd_abstract_narration": "The equipment purchased through this project is to improve                 laboratory instruction and enhance opportunities for undergraduate              student research in plant ecology and evolutionary biology.  Several            functionally related items being installed include plant growth                 chambers, balances, a portable photosynthesis system, a portable leaf           area meter, a datalogger, and equipment for extracting biochemical              compounds from plant tissues.  This new equipment responds to increased         student interest in ecology and evolutionary biology by assisting the           faculty to  (1) introduce new courses in Aquatic Biology and Population         Biology, (2) add a new laboratory component to the existing                     Evolutionary Biology course, (3) improve laboratory instruction in              five other existing courses, and (4) increase the kinds of projects             that students may conduct as independent research.                                                                                                                   In the instructional laboratories, the new equipment is being used         in a variety of exercises that include investigations of the effects of         environmental parameters on plant growth, development, and metabolism           in both natural environments and under controlled conditions;                   experimental studies of plant competition under controlled                      environmental conditions; and studies of the inheritance of traits              affected by many genes (quantitative traits).                                                                                                                        The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
