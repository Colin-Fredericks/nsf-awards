 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Laurie Butler is supported by a Presidential Young                       investigator Grant form the  Physical Chemistry Program to                      study photofragmentation of gas phase molecules which have been                 electronically excited with laser radiation.                                                                                                                       Dr. Butler is studying the rapid dipole-dipole induced                       transfer of electronic energy between two chromophores in a                     molecule.  In particular, she is studying the nature of this                    energy transfer in 1,2-C2F4BrI fragmentation in which C-I and                   C-Br fission compete following initial excitation to the C-Br                   repulsive surface.  This work is particularly important since,                  if this intramolecular energy transfer could be suppressed, one                 might conceive of selective excitation and fragmentation of                     individual bonds.                                                                                                                                                  Dr. Butler is also utilizing emission spectroscopy of                        dissociating molecules to study intersections between repulsive                 electronic states which alter the dissociation pathways of                      polyatomic molecules.  Measurements made in Dr. Butler's                        laboratory provide detailed data on such nonadiabatic                           dissociations thus permitting the determination of internuclear                 separation, relative velocity, and electronic energy at the                     crossing as well as the time required to reach the crossing.                                                                                                       Dr. Butler's research is addressing fundamental questions                    regarding the process by which an initial electronic excitation                 may result in specific dissociation channels among many                         energetically allowed ones.  By measuring product velocities,                   internal energies, and angular distributions of products, she                   can directly address qustions regarding the redistribution of                   electronic energy produced by laser excitation.",
