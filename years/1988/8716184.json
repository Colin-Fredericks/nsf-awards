 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of U.S. scientists in a               seminar on two-phase flow dynamics organized jointly by Professor               Owen Jones, Jr. of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Professor               Itaru Michiyoshi of Kyoto University, Japan.  Participants from the             United States and Japan will meet in Kyoto, Japan during July                   1988.  The seminar will feature a broad review of the status of                 research on two-phase flow dynamics, including the following                    topics:  formulation of field equations and closure conditions,                 flow regime modeling and dynamics, interfacial area density                     modeling, nonequilibrium modeling, hydrodynamic instabilities,                  pressure wave propagation and shock phenomena, critical two-phase               flow, vapor explosions, forced convective heat transfer, post                   dryout heat transfer, numerical methods and closure relationships,              and computer analysis of two-phase flows.                                                                                                                       Research in two-phase flow and heat transfer is motivated in large              part by the great need to understand the phenomena taking place                 during postulated abnormal operational transients and accidents in              nuclear reactors.  Japanese research in this area can be                        characterized as quite fundamental, while U.S. scientists have                  tended recently to deal with more applied work.  Thus, the direct               interaction to be provided by this seminar is expected to                       contribute significantly to the knowledge base in the area of                   two-phase flow dynamics.  This will lead to progress in energy                  conversion research, especially regarding nuclear safety systems.",
