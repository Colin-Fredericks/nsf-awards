 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator (PI) will study the use of artificial                neural networks in robotic control.  A variety of nonlinear adaptive            control problems will be simulated for a one-link manipulator applying          force to various objects.  Flexible and rigid manipulators will                 interact with mobile and fixed objects to conduct various tasks                 specified by the PI>  The nonlinear adaptive controller will                    incorporate an artificial neural network that learns the nonlinear              dynamics of the manipulator.  Computer simulations will be used to              assess the performance of robotic controllers based on neural                   networks.  The ability of neural networks to approximate multivariate           nonlinear functions representing robot manipulator dynamics will be             exploited in a feedforward controller architecture.  Research will              focus on learning algorithms for neural networks used with both rigid           and flexible one-link systems.                                                                                                                                  Adaptation to varying dynamics caused by wear or by picking up objects          will also be examined, as will alternative architectures for                    controller.  the goal of this project is to create a neural network             controller that is applicable to any control problem.",
