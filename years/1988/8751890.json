The goal of this           research is to develop and demonstrate intelligent tutoring techniques          that will yield a dramatic increase in the effectiveness of intelligent         tutoring to a three standard deviation effect.  This effort will                advance in four fronts.  We will develop deeper cognitive models that           get at the planning behind mathematics problem solving.  We will extend         our model-tracing techniques to deal with a word-problem-oriented               curriculum.  We will identify which features of human and computer              pedagogical strategy are effective.  We will identify develop interface         features for delivering speech, for instructing declarative structures,         and for graphically reifying abstract mathematical concepts.                                                                                                    The first two years of this proposal will be devoted to exploring these         directions.  Effort in the third and fourth years will also be directed         towards demonstration of this technology and towards dissemination of           the technology.  We will develop and integrated algebra and geometry            tutor that will cover in one year the material that is normally covered         in two.  We will create a general tutoring architecture that can be             used by others to develop mathematics curriculum.",
