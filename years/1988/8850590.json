 "awd_abstract_narration": "This twelve-month project of the Mathematical Association of America            (MAA) will establish a Prognostic Testing Network.  The testing will use        college-level placement tests to predict deficiencies in high school            juniors.  With the knowledge of these deficiencies, high school students        that plan to go on to college can, during their senior year, remediate          their deficiencies so that upon entering college they are more likely to        be placed in college level courses.  Prognostic testing programs have           been either started or established in eight states and at least six             states are known to be interested in prognostic testing.  The MAA               Prognostic Testing Network will organize these efforts and provide a            network by which information can be exchanged and additional states             could obtain help in starting their own programs.  The project will             sponsor a two-day conference to discuss and disseminate the prognostic          testing model and to organize the MAA Prognostic Testing Network.                                                                                               The cost sharing for this project will be thirty-eight percent.",
