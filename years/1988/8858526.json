 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to identify new technologies in                image analysis and and computer graphics that may have applications             for observing and evaluating fluid transport in porous media.  This             is the initial increment of support for research to be undertaken by            this Presidential Young Investigator who has an interest in using               visual analytical techniques for analyzing the transport of immiscible          fluids through porous media as a step toward formulation of physical            models that can be used to predict the rate of diffusion and                    dispersion of groundwater pollutants.  The work involves use of                 digital image analysis techniques for analysis of microscopic                   transport processes, observation and quantification of small-scale              variations in pore structure and fluid properties on macroscopic                transport processes as steps toward obtaining a better understanding            than now exists of the transport of immiscible fluids in porous                 media.  This, in turn, is expected to have applicability in                     engineering design of systems for management of fluids that pose a              threat to the quality of groundwater used for industrial, commercial            and municipal purposes.",
