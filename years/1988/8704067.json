 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Pipher at the University of Rochester will use an infrared                  array camera which she helped develop to obtain images of regions               of star formation in our Galaxy and in starburst galaxies.  The                 objective of the program is to study the interactions of stars                  and of central energy sources of galaxies with the surrounding                  gas and dust.  With the infrared array camera, Dr. Pipher has the               unprecedented  ability to resolve structure in these cosmic                     sources, which should unfold new phenomena and elucidate their                  physical characteristics.                                                                                                                                       The infrared region of the spectrum is only now being exploited                 with a shift from an instrumental development phase to one of                   addressing astrophysical problems.  Infrared detector arrays now                provide high quality images of sources.  Regions of star                        formation and the nuclei of other galaxies have become initial                  targets for observation at infrared wavelengths because the dust                which characterizes these regions prevents any visible radiation                from escaping the cloud and revealing activity within.  Thus, new               cosmic phenomena are being explored in ways never before                        possible.",
