 "awd_abstract_narration": "Particle channeling occurs when an energetic charged particle                   beam is aligned with a major crystal axis or plane.  Channeling                 has contributed in important ways to our understanding of                       particle motion in solids at the fundamental level and just as                  significantly has led to numerous applications in physics and                   technology.  Furthermore, channeling is a new source of                         interesting and challenging mathematical problems in dynamical                  systems and stochastic processes.  A complete understanding of                  channeling requires detailed knowledge of the channeling particle               motion and the spatial and momentum densities of the particles as               they penetrate the crystal.                                                                                                                                     Ellison's mathematical approach to the study of channeling will                 continue including:  channeling effects in strain-layer                         superlattices and other distorted crystals, channeling radiation                and related quantum electrodynamical processes; multiple                        scattering effects viewed as particle motion in a random media;                 and channeling in perfect crystals viewed within the context of                 dynamical systems.  This research will deepen our knowledge of                  channeling, extend its usefulness and lead to new applications.                 Furthermore, the dynamical systems and probabilistic methods                    developed to solve these problems will be of general                            applicability and will have importance in other areas of                        mathematical science.",
