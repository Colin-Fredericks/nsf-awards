 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide partial support for a series of short                 courses on topics of current interest to college and university                 science faculty.  The course presenters are scholars at the                     frontiers of their disciplines who meet intensively for several                 days with faculty to communicate new knowledge, concepts, and                   techniques which will enhance college instruction.  The national                program will offer about 70 courses per year at locations in the                various regions of the country.  Also, some courses will be                     offered at special discipline-related sites.  Included will be                  topics of interest to faculty in mathematics, the natural and                   social sciences, and engineering.  The program will be evaluated                for constant improvement of its service to faculty.  It will                    update and enhance the teaching of an average of some two                       thousand college and university faculty each year.                                                                                                              In addition to NSF support, participants and their institutions                 will contribute about three times as much to the operation of the               project.",
