 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plan Formulation can be regarded as the Design of Behavior:                this view of the process leads naturally to an integration of the               emerging technology of intelligent design support systems with                  the formulation of plans for the manufacture of artefacts so                    designed.  This project is aimed at investigating this approach                 using the Edinburgh Designer System as a basis on which to build                an experimental plan formulation and execution system for                       assembly.  Following Barrow's work on VLSI design, designs are                  specified in terms on modules, with a formalism for defining                    action modules whose genesis will lie in the need to create                     certain interface modules in the design (e.g. the seating of a                  bearing on a shaft) and whose realisation will be as action                     schemas in the robot control system under development.  An action               module can be regarded as achieving an assembly goal or goals and               goal interactions, which may arise from spatial-resource                        contention and kinestraints, with an appropriate inference                      capability being implemented.  The exploitation of symmetry in                  this area will be studied and computationally tractable means of                representing and manipulation the relevant group-theoretical                    entities will be developed.",
