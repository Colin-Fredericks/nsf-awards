 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chromaffin cells will be used as a model for studying stimulus-                 secretion coupling.  Release of catecolamines from these cells,                 which is dependent on an increase in intracellular calcium                      levels, can result from either depolarization of the membrane                   (voltage-mediated) or an activation of cholinergic receptors                    (receptor- or agonist- mediated).  It is not known, however, at                 what point other than an increase in intracellular calcium the                  signaling pathways underlying the two modes of stimulation                      leading to secretion converge.  The objective of this study is to               answer this question by using a high temporal resolution                        technique to examine the two pathways, and to determine whether                 the two pathways are similarly modulated by common second                       messenger systems.  The whole-cell \"tight seal\" voltage-clamp                   method will be employed to measure ionic currents and to assay                  secretion.  Secretion is associated with the fusion of                          cytoplasmic vesicles with the plasma membrane.  These fusion                    events increase total membrane area which is reflected as an                    increase in membrane capacitance.  Thus, by simultaneously                      recording membrane capacitance and conductance, it is possible to               determine the activity of ion channels and secretion of                         catecholamines simultaneously.  Furthermore, recent advances in                 calcium measurement with fluorescent dyes make it possible to                   assay intracellular calcium levels over the same brief period of                time.                                                                                                                                                           The ability to correlate transmembrane ionic currents and changes               in intracellular calcium levels with the process of secretion by                exocytosis provides a uniquely powerful combination of approaches               to the cellular mechanisms controlling exocytosis at the single                 cell level.  The results of this research will provide more                     detailed knowledge of the sequence of events which couple                       stimulation to cellular secretion.",
