A workshop will be held in early October,                 1988, focussing on institutional needs, specific new problems                   associated with data management and networking of collections,                  and the demands on systematics resources.  Participants will                    include museum professionals, representatives from several                      societies of systematic biologists, data management                             professionals, and other users of systematic collections.                            As a foundation for the workshop, data will be gathered on                 the current status and needs of systematic collections of all                   sizes and types.  These data will be analyzed before the                        workshop and presented, along with the results of the workshop                  deliberations, in a comprehensive summary report and series of                  recommendations to the National Science Foundation.                                  This is the first national-level workshop to integrate the                 imperatives of information management, as considered by data                    management professionals, into the planning of broader                          institutional needs for systematic collections.  The workshop is                unique in representing the perspectives of those doing research                 as well as museum administrators.  It will also integrate data                  from earlier symposia sponsored by the Association of Systematic                Collections on living and culture collections and on orphaned                   collections.",
