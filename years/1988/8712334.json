 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will focus on five areas of environmetrics:                  the partitioning of spatial variability, confidence bands for                   interpolated random functions, quantile estimates for integrated                processes, using covariate information for quantile estimation,                 and environmental indicies for trend estimation.   In the first                 area, the effects of modeling the regression structure in the                   spatial covariance function will be assessed.  In the second                    area, the problem is to calculate the probability that the entire               field is below a specified level, conditional on the                            observations.  The feasibility of approximating this probability                with a series expansion of the conditional covariance field that                is amenable to the application of Hotelling's inequality will be                determined.  In the third area, distributional modelling will be                used to relate tail probabilities of a monthly integrated                       concentration process, allowing for the non-exhaustive nature of                historical data.  In the fourth area, extensions of Pareto tail                 estimators for the case of jointly distributed vector random                    variables will be sought.  In the fifth area, methods to account                for the spatial autocorrelation of separate monitoring station                  data will be developed.                                                              This research is in the general area of spatial statistics                 and is motivated by statistical problems in environmental                       measurement and regulation.  There is increasing attention in                   statistics being directed at these problems involving interesting               and variable dependencies among the observations.  Results in                   this area are needed for informative policy development and sound               regulation practices.",
