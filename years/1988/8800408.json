 "awd_abstract_narration": "By June 1988, Dr. Kolenda plans to have completed the first                attempts to use the Cray supercomputer to sort the marriage                     networks of about 5000 adult Nattatti Nadars of south India into                clusters.  This requires the comparison of each Nadar's network                 of about 150-200 scores with all the scores of all the other                    Nadars.  The cluster analysis should locate sub-connubia                        (especially tigh marriage networks or breeding populations) among               the 2500 Nadar families.  When this data=bank is prepared,                      Dr. Kolenda will work with statisticians at Rice University to                  develop approaches and methods to exploit its possibilities.                    Such vast data are rare, and given the close-relative and cousin-               marriage among the population, it should be a useful research                   population for population genetics and microdemographic studies.                Dr. Kolenda will also consult with anthropologists at Rice who                  are specialists on south Indian kinship, India, and cultural                    anthropology more broadly.                                                           Dr. Kolenda will teach a seminar on \"Research Methods in                   Cultural Anthropology\" and another on \"Networks:  Their Theory                  and Study.\"  In addition, she will give lectures on the process                 of her research to the faculty and students of both the                         Department of Statistics and the Department of Anthropology.                         This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1)                 to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                  engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF                  and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and                     engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists                and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic                    institutions.  By encouraging the participation of women in                     science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future                     scientific vitality.",
