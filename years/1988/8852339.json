 "awd_abstract_narration": "Principles and applications of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry is          being introduced into the chemistry curriculum as one phase of                  improving chemical education.  Through the purchase of a bench top              GC/MS complete with computer operating system and software the students         are being given the opportunity to gain hands on experience with this           powerful modern analytical technique.  The instrumentation is being             introduced in analytical and advanced opportunities sequence and                carries over into organic, inorganic, physical and biochemistry                 courses.                                                                                                                                                        The project is fostering within the undergraduates the familiarity,             knowledge, and expertise in modern chemical instrumentation required            for successful undergraduate research, careers in industry or entry             into professional and graduate schools.  Through an advanced                    opportunity program, students are being exposed to the major areas of           chemical instrumentation in their freshman and sophomore years.                 Analytical instrumentation, presently fragmented throughout the                 curriculum, is being brought together in a unified junior level                 advanced analytical course.  A new emphasis is being brought to                 undergraduate research within the department.
