 "awd_abstract_narration": "The new geotechnical centrifuge at the University of Colorado-                  Boulder is the first large (400 g-tons) centrifuge in the U.S.                  and is one of the few of this size in the world.  It is just now                going through its acceptance tests and is expected to be on line                soon.  This proposal represents the first major effort to apply                 this new device to a major research problem.                                    The problem of interest is the driveability and subsequent load-                settlement behavior of pile foundations.  This problem is a                     severe one in engineering practice.  No fundamental analytical                  methods exist for the solution of these problems.  Laboratory                   model tests performed at 1-g of acceleration have been shown not                to describe field conditions with acceptable accuracy.  Full                    scale field tests with fully instrumented piles have typically                  cost in excess of $100,000, with some costing more than $1                      million, per pile test.  Thus, field programs involving a series                of tests are prohibitively expensive.  In addition, field tests                 always suffer from the fact that actual sites involve non-uniform               soils, and the act of taking soil samples changes the properties                that are to be measured so the engineers are always uncertain                   about actual field conditions around any given pile.  Laboratory                model tests can be performed using soils of known physical                      properties but simulation of the proper stress state requires                   either field-scale laboratory testing or the use of a centrifuge                to scale up gravitational accelerations, and thus scale down the                physical size of the system.                                                    The proposed research involves two phases, viz., development of                 equipment for pile driving with the pile, hammer, and soil all                  \"in flight\", to simulate field conditions, and then a series of                 proof tests.  Researchers will develop pile hammers that model                  full scale field hammers properly, and will drive piles with the                centrifuge running.  The piles and soil will both be instrumented               to determine relevant conditions developing during the time that                stress waves are passing through the system during driving.                     Efforts are planned to compare the results of these measurements                with a very restricted number of measurements involving full-                   scale piles in the field.                                                       The intent of this research is to develop and proof-test the                    required equipment, and to perform the research necessary initial               tests to show that the technique is a viable one for modelling                  actual field conditions.  It is then expected that substantial                  additional support will come from industry and mission oriented                 government labs for support of research to develop better methods               for pile support of such structures as off shore oil structures,                and bridges.",
