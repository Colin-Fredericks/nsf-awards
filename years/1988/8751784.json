 "awd_abstract_narration": "PRISMS - Physics Resources and Instructional Strategies for Motivating          Students is a two-year leadership project at the University of Northern         Iowa to increase achievement in high school physics and to cultivate            reasoning and problem solving skills in science.  50 well qualified             physics resource teachers from throughout the country will be trained in        the use of materials and strategies that have been developed and                validated by the Iowa Physics Task Force.  The materials include a              teacher's resource guide, Physics Resources and Instructional Strategies        for Motivating Students (PRISMS), which contain more than 125                   activities.  The program emphasizes \"learning cycle\" pedagogy.  It              includes a three-week workshop during the first summer of operation, and        extensive academic year follow-up activities.  Participants who                 successfully complete the academic year leadership component will               receive up to 2 units of graduate credit.",
