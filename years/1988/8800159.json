 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project tests the hypothesis that insulin and insulin-             like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) can inhibit gene expression in                     lymphocytes.  This laboratory recently reported that the growth                 inducing properties of Interleukin-2 (IL-2) for normal T and B                  cells can be inhibited by superphysiologic doses of insulin and                 physiologic doses of IGF-1.  Since large doses of insulin are                   required in comparison to those required for IGF-1, we have                     postulated that the growth inhibitory properties of insulin are                 mediated through the IGF-1 receptor on lymphocytes.  The                        experiments will be in two areas:  the ability of insulin/IGF-1                 to modulate IL-2 gene expression in T cells will be tested, and                 the ability of insulin/IGF-1 to modulate immunoglobulin M (IgM) J               chain gene expression in the BCL1 B cell lymphoma system will be                analyzed.  The studies will establish whether insulin/IGF-1 are                 important hormones for inhibition of gene expression, cell                      growth, and differentiation of T and B cells.                                           The interactive component involves guest lectures in                    undergraduate and graduate Immunology courses and a special                     topics course on the molecular and cell biology of T cells.                     Additionally, Dr. Eardley is organizing a weekly discussion                     group, including a Saturday workshop, relating to issues                        concerning women in science.                                                            This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1)              to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                  engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF                  and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and                     engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists                and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic                    institutions.  By encouraging the participation of women in                     science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future                     scientific vitality.",
