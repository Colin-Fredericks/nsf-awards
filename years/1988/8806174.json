 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is intended for the purchase of state-of-the-art                  equipment which will be used at the newly established laboratory for            high voltage dielectric and insulation research at Arizona State                University.  The equipment to be purchased are a high voltage multi-            test set for generating ac, dc and impulse voltages, and an impulse             analyzing system, which along with the existing facilities will be              used initially for two specific projects described in this proposal.            These projects, selected due to their importance to industry and                expertise of the principal investigators, deal with the scientific              understanding of the principles which lead to the development of                better materials and insulting systems for use in outdoor high voltage          transmission and distribution, and space insulation applications.               Graduate students, aiming for an advanced degree (MS or Ph.D) in                electrical engineering, will work on these projects.  Thus, this                research program will not only advance the existing knowledge in the            field of high voltage engineering but will also help in the                     development of the much needed highly qualified engineers.",
