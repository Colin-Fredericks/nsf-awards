 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. McGovern and his colleagues will conduct archaeological                     excavation at the large and deeply stratified farm midden site of               Svalbard, Iceland.  Preliminary work in 1987 indicated that                     organic preservation is excellent and the skeletal remains from a               number of species (food remains) are present.  In the summer of                 1988, the team will conduct extensive stratigraphic excavation at               Svalbard to establish the chronology of the main deposit using                  artifacts, tephera and radiocarbon dating.  They will collect                   animal bone, artifacts, pollen macrofloral and micorfaunal                      remains with two goals in mind:  to reconstruct changing                        environment over time and to document the inhabitant's response                 to it.                                                                                                                                                          Between 800 - 1000 AD Viking-age Scandinavian populations spread                into the islands of the North Atlantic taking with them a well-                 developed seafaring tradition and a subsistence economy based                   upon domestic animals and some cereals.  As they moved into new                 regions they adapted this to include wild resources which were                  readily available.  Archaeology in Iceland can shed light on this               adaptive process and is especially interesting because it                       provides insight into how human populations cope in marginal                    environments.  Beginning ca. 1250 AD a significant climatic                     cooling known as the \"Little Ice Age\" (LIA) began.  This affected               the Viking colonies and placed great stress on local populations.               The Svalbard site is particularly interesting because it                        documents this period and the data which Dr. McGovern recovers                  will provide insight into how human populations adapt to severe                 climatic stress.  Because faunal and floral material is so well                 preserved detailed subsistence reconstruction will be possible.",
