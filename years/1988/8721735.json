 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) under the direction                of Theodore H. Geballe at Stanford University has three major                   objectives: to support multidisciplinary efforts in materials                   research which require the participation of several investigators               to make progress; to fund an important set of central facilities                which support a wide range of materials research on campus; and                 to start outstanding new research efforts rapidly and                           intelligently through the use of \"seed money\".  Of the 60 or so                 faculty members currently active in the MRL, about 35 participate               in thrust area research or receive direct MRL project support.                  There are about 35 graduate students and 4 postdoctoral research                associates in the program, which maintains strong links with                    industrial and government research laboratories through                         cooperative research.  Seven students participate in the NSF                    \"Research Experience for Undergraduates\" program through the                    Stanford MRL.                                                                        The research program includes major thrust areas in                        optoelectronic and infrared materials, polymer structure and                    dynamics, structure and properties of thin films (primarily high-               temperature superconducting materials), and photon materials                    research using free electron laser and synchrotron sources to                   address electronic properties of surfaces and interfaces.                            A particular strength of the Stanford MRL is its ability to                span the range from basic science to engineering the individual                 thrust areas as well as in the program as a whole.  The thrust                  research is strongly interactive, faculty are first-rate and the                quality of students and postdoctoral associates is very high.                   The MRL is well equipped and is addressing scientifically                       challenging and technologically significant research problems.                  The research on optoelectronic and infrared materials, polymers,                and high-temperature superconducting thin films is at the                       forefront; the research on photon materials science involving the               free electron laser and synchrotron radiation studies of surface                chemistry is an exciting new initiative.  Seed funding is used                  effectively, and there are strong interactions with industrial                  research groups.",
