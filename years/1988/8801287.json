 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports travel by 15 U.S. scientists to the         International Conference on Raman Spectroscopy to be held in Calcutta,          India, Nov. 1988. The conference is planned to commemorate the 100th            birthday of C.V. Raman and the 60th anniversary of the discovery of the         Raman Effect.  The U.S. participants comprise chemists and physicists.          Their work covers the range of Raman Spectroscopy from small molecules          in the gas phase to nucleic acids.  Most of them are well known                 scientists, but some are younger scientists doing exceptional work in           their fields.  Each has provided a title for the topic to be presented          at the conference.  Participants from India and from other countries            are expected to be similarly well selected.  The Indian organizer is            Dr. C.N.R. Rao, Director of the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore,         India, aided by some of that country's most eminent scientists.  It is          expected that the proceedings of this major conference will be                  published for permanent reference.                                                                                                                              Scope:  The U.S. and India have a significant number of well known              scientists who have worked, and continue to do research, utilizing this         field of investigation, first identified by Raman.  They work in                materials, biology, physics, chemistry and other fields.  The meeting           is very likely to result in considerable exchanges of information and           possibly lead to future research collaboration in these areas.",
