 "awd_abstract_narration": "A gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer system with thermal desorption            capability has been acquired which permits the quantatative                     identification of complex organic compounds at low levels in air, water,        and soil.  This system complements the inorganic, microbiologic, and            radiologic environmental monitoring and analysis capabilities of the            department.  Such equipment is vital to the education of the students in        the earth sciences and the environmental sciences and engineering areas,        all of whom receive extensive training in most aspects of environmental         testing and most of whom secure positions with governmental agencies,           private laboratories, environmental groups, or companies directly               concerned with environmental testing and assessment.  The relative              importance of organic compounds in the enviromnent is increasing and            students should be provided with the education necessary to identify and        assess the sighnificance of these compounds.  The grantee provides funds        for this project that are more than an equal match for the NSF award.",
