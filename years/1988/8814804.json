 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to provide support for the American            Academy of Environmental Engineers to conduct a conference/workshop to          determine the environmental engineering research needed to assist the           United States in becoming more competitive than it now is with other            industrialized countries that do not have the relatively high costs             associated with meeting environmental quality goals as are prevalent            in the United States.                                                                                                                                           The American Academy of Environmental Engineers is an organization              that certifies persons who are determined to be qualified in air                pollution control, general environmental engineering, hazardous waste           management, industrial hygiene, radiation protection, solid waste               management, water supply and wastewater and in sanitary engineering.            The academy is sponsored by the Air Pollution Control Association, the          American Institute of Chemical Engineers, the American Public Health            Association, the American Public Works Association, the American                Society for Engineering Education, the American Society of Civil                Engineers, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the American           Water Works Association, the Association of Environmental Engineering           Professors, the National Society of Professional Engineers, and the             Water Pollution Control Federation.                                                                                                                             The Academy plans to hold this conference/workshop in the metropolitan          Washington, D.C. area late in October or in November of 1988.  Topics           planned for consideration include modeling for engineering practice to          determine the location of pollution abatement systems; innovative               concepts, processes and systems for treatment of water to meet use-             requirements and treatment of wastes to reduce their pollutional effect         on the environment; detoxification of hazardous organic substances; and         process modifications to reduce or eliminate production of wastes.                                                                                              Current environmental quality standards in the United States are aimed          at safeguarding the quality of life in the nation.  Improvements in             ability to meet existing and future standards at lower cost could have a        significant effect on improvement of the ability of the United States to        compete more successfully than it now does with other industrial                countries.",
