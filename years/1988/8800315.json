 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this study is to summarize and critically discuss                soot nucleation, growth, and oxidation.  The soot physical                      appearance and microstructure, as well as the nature of the soot                nucleus are also treated at some length.  The present effort                    focusses on a number of points, some of which have not yet been                 satisfactorily resolved.  They include:                                                                                                                         1.   Chemical species that are important in the prenucleation                        stage.                                                                     2.   Nature of the nucleus (ionic or radical).                                  3.   Relative importance of fuel composition and amount of                           oxidizer to the flame temperature.                                                                                                                         The present study will also include a discussion of the effects                 of additives and of selected work involving hydrocarbon                         decomposition.                                                                                                                                                  The overall gain to be expected from this review is a                           clarification of the research problems worthy of NSF support in                 the soot generation area.  The current situation is one of                      contention and overspecialization.  A broad redefinition of                     objectives is urgently needed; this review would provide a solid                technical base for such an effort.",
