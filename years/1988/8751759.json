The program is designed                 to help these teachers become familiar with several aspects of                  modern physics.  This is done through the use of modules which                  emphasize areas of modern physics with widespread technological                 applications.  The four physics modules . Lasers and the Nature                 of Light, Lightwave Communication, Magnetism and Magnetic                       Recording, and Semiconductors and Transistors . have been                       developed in collaboration with scientists from AT&T Bell                       Laboratories and Bell Communication Research (with partial                      support from a prior NSF grant).  University and industrial                     scientists will provide background lectures to increase the depth               of teacher understanding of the modules.                                                                                                                        Participants will be selected from among the best high school                   teachers in country.  Each will be required to provide assurances               from local school officials that they will be able to carry out                 the in.service activities needed to help other physics teachers                 to become familiar with the new modules.  The program includes                  academic year support and second year follow.up for the                         leadership teachers.",
