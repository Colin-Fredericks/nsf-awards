 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is aimed at determining the consequences of a             physical refuge upon the dynamics of a predator-prey system.  Red               scale is pest of citrus that is controlled by the parasitoid                    Aphytis in southern California.  A refuge population of scale                   exists, to an extent that varies among cultivars, in the interior               of the citrus tree.  Citrus cultivars also vary in the scale load               they carry on exterior foliage and fruit.  The hypothesis to be                 tested is that a key to the stability of scale density on the                   foliage is the extent to which the refuge population is                         developed.  An extensive survey of citrus groves will be                        conducted to test this hypotheses in which both the refuge and                  exterior populations will be sampled.  A series of experiments                  aimed at providing a mechanistic explanation for between-cultivar               variation in terms of mortality due to natural enemies and                      crawler migration rates will be done.  Using this information, a                model that predicts the influence of refuge populations  on                     exterior populations will be developed.                                                 Red scale-Aphytis interaction is considered a model system              for studying the effect of a physical refuge on population                      dynamics.  The impact of the refuge in terms of effect on                       population size will be assessed and the factors determining the                contribution of the refuge to total recruitment will be                         quantified.",
