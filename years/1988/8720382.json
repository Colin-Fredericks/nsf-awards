 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will focus on the development of a novel and                      ultrasensitive apparatus for the detection of fluorescent probes.               A detection system will be constructed that is sensitive enough                 to observe the fluorescence emitted by individual fluorophores.                 The new concept of single molecule counting or gating will be                   used to provide the necessary discrimination against Raleigh,                   Raman and detector background.  To develop this detection system                and to demonstrate the detection of individual fluorescent                      molecules in solution, the laser excited fluorescence from                      fluorophores in a flowing sample system will be studied.  In the                second part of this project, two-dimensional laser scanner                      systems will be constructed, utilizing this detection system,                   which will obtain images of the location of individual                          fluorophores on substrates such as slides, gels and films. The                  concepts of auto and cross correlation of multiple images will be               used to provide further discrimination against spatially random                 background.  Initial experiments on individual fluorophores and                 on fluorescent labeled antibodies or fluorescent beads in thin                  films will be used to demonstrate the imaging technique.                        Feasibility experiments exploring the sensitivity of this new                   technique for finding labeled protein or DNA bands on gels or                   fluorescent antibody conjugates with bacteria will be performed.                The improved analytical sensitivity that will be provided by this               methodology  will be particularly valuable because it will                      increase the speed and sensitivity with which immunofluorescence                assays and fluorescence-detected DNA sequencing gels can be                     performed.  Significant future applications may include                         immunofluorescence detection of individual cell surface receptors               or markers and the location of DNA probes on chromosomes.                                                                                                       The detection of individual cell receptors or markers by                        fluorescent labeling will enable investigators of cellular and                  molecular processes to understand these processes more                          accurately. The complex molecular makeup of cells leads to                      difficulties identifying a specific molecule separately from a                  background of many different molecules.  Detection improvement                  will benefit many areas of biology such as cell physiology,                     neurobiology, and biophysical cytology.",
