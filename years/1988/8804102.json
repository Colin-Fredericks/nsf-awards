 "awd_abstract_narration": "A 500 MHz NMR Spectrometer will be acquired to support research                 in biochemistry and chemistry.  Among the projects to be                        supported are organic synthesis of heterocyclic compounds,                      physical, synthetic and organic chemistry of natural products,                  enzyme mechanism, and peptide and protein folding.  Contemporary                research methods in 1D and 2D NMR will be done using observations               of homonuclei and heteronuclei, chemical shift correlation                      spectroscopy (COSY), nuclear Overhauser effect correlation                      spectroscopy (NOESY), and relay transfer spectroscopy.                                                                                                          The applications in synthetic chemistry will be of long-term                    value to industrial development in general and biotechnology in                 particular; similarly, the biochemical studies, on enzyme                       mechanism, and peptide and protein folding, address major                       problems of biological interest and will have an impact in                      biotechnology and in the long term in health-related research.                  Without this instrumentation, some of the experiments proposed                  could not be carried out; others could be carried out only much                 much more slowly.  The instrumentation allows a detailed analysis               of physical properties of biological and organic compounds and is               essential for progress on the immediate basic scientific                        questions.",
