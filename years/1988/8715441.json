 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this two-year cooperative research award between               David J. Sellmyer, University of Nebraska and Zhao Jiangao, Chinese             Academy of Sciences' Institute of Physics is to study amorphous                 multilayered magnetic films based on rare-earths and transition                 metals.  The investigators will concentrate on the relationship                 between physical properties such as magnetic ordering, random and               coherent magnetic anisotropy and the microscopic structure of these             alloy materials.  The structure of homogenous and inhomogenous                  glasses and the potential of these materials for magneto-optic                  information storage will be assessed.  This new proposals extends               the research performed under a 1985 U.S.-China cooperative research             grant.                                                                                                                                                          Rare earth-transition metal base alloys research is a very active               and important area of materials sciences.  These alloys are                     currently considered to be the best candidates for electronic                   devices and magnetic data storage.  Their fundamental understanding             will contribute to improved and better designed materials.  High                field magnetization, x-ray diffraction and electron microscopy                  measurements will be performed concurrently at the University of                Nebraska and the Institute of Physics.  The combined efforts of U.S.            and Chinese scientists and laboratory facilities in performing these            important measurements fulfills the U.S.-China Program principal                objective, which is to advance scientific knowledge through                     international collaboration.",
