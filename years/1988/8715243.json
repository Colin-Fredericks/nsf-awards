 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between                          Prof. Tobias Owen, State University of New York at                              Stony Brook, and a group of French astronomers, led by                          Dr. Therese Encrenaz, at the Meudon Observatory,                                CNRS, in France.  The objective of this research is to                          continue a joint study of planetary atmospheres, with                           particular emphasis on unresolved questions concerning                          the atmospheres of Venus and Neptune; the historical                            presence of water on Mars; and the composition of the                           Great Red Spot on Jupiter.  In this project, new                                infrared spectra of the atmospheres of Venus, Jupiter,                          and Neptune will be obtained and analyzed.  In                                  addition, Voyager spacecraft data from Mars will be                             analyzed.                                                                                                                                                       Astronomers at the Meudon Observatory are world                                 leaders in the field of infrared spectroscopy.                                  Although many of the high-resolution spectroscopic                              measurements are made at the Canada-France-US                                   Telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, the Fourier Transform                           Spectrometer used there was developed by one of the                             French collaborators.  The collaboration thus                                   contributes greatly to the acquisition of the precise                           experimental data required for this project.  The                               joint experience is also expected to be useful to both                          sides in the development of future instruments                                  suitable for infrared spectroscopy, such as the Hubble                          Space Telescope.",
