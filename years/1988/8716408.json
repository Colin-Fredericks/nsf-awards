 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research award will help the investigator to                       reconstruct balanced paleographic maps of the Western Europe and                the adjacent North Atlantic shelves and basins using the                        available information on the sediment types, their thicknesses,                 ages and porosities for the onshore and offshore areas and global               sedimentary mass balance equations.  This technique of loading                  the eroded sediments back on to the continent and then                          calculating the continental topography and thereby arriving at                  the uplift and subsidence rates is extraodinarily imaginative and               innovative.  The PI using a similar data base and mass balance                  calculations was extremely successful in reconstructing                         paleotopography, paleodrainage basins, paleobathymetry and past                 uplifts and subsidences of the North American continent and the                 adjoining areas for the last 70 MY.  Such balanced                              paleogeographic maps will provide calibration for the sea level                 curve for the Western Europe and will help in determining the                   significance of epeirogenic movements vis-a-vis eustatic sea                    level changes in each of the drainage and depositional basins.                  Also this modeling technique will produce the kind of topographic               information that is required for sophisticated climate and ocean                circulation modeling.  During the 1st and 2nd year, the PI while                on his sabbatical in University of Munich will gather the                       necessary data.  This will be followed by rigorous computer                     intensive work to generate paleographic maps.  This study                       represents a wholly new approach in the determination of paleo                  sea level rises and falls, a subject of much investigation at the               present time.                                                                                                                                                           Dr. Hay is an extremely capable scientist who for the last              decade took leadership in pioneering research in a variety of                   subjects and there is no doubt that the proposed study will",
