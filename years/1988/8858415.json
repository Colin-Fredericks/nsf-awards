 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Presidential Young Investigator Award project is in the                    general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the                     subfield of dynamic surface processes.  The emphasis of the                     research activities that are enabled by this award is on the time-              dependence of fundamental surface phenomena.  Surface diffusion,                surface relaxation kinetics, desorption dynamics, and vibrational               and electronic energy relaxation on surfaces are the main areas                 of investigation.  These studies are being performed on well-                   characterized metal, semiconductor, and oxide surfaces that are                 relevant to heterogeneous catalysis, electronic device                          fabrication, and photochemical energy conversion.                                                                                                               In order to measure surface diffusion and surface reaction                      kinetics, Professor George is utilizing laser-induced thermal                   desorption (LITD) techniques.  Of particular interest is the                    ability of LITD techniques to explore the effects of surface                    additives such as carbon and sulfur on the surface kinetics of                  catalytically relevant processes.  He is also using LITD                        techniques to investigate the surface kinetics of processes that                are important in semiconductor processing.  Additionally,                       Professor George is exploring chemical bonding and reaction                     kinetics on silicon surfaces using transmission Fourier transform               infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) as a vibrational spectroscopic probe               of these surface processes.  He is also seeking to characterize                 the interactions and electronic energy transfer between                         chromophores on dielectric oxide surfaces using laser induced                   fluorescence (LIF) techniques that provide both structural and                  time-dependent information with sub-monolayer sensitivity.",
