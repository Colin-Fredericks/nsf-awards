 "awd_abstract_narration": "Howard Jacobowitz will continue his work in Cauchy Riemann                 geometry and several complex variables. This an important area                  which involves both topological and analytic aspects of complex                 variable theory. Jacobowitz will bring geometric techniques to                  bear on the problems under investigation. A major theme                         throughout the research will be embedding problems for Cauchy                   Riemann structures.                                                                  One aim of the research is to prove a more general boundary                version of the Newlander-Nirenberg theorem and thereby obtain                   conditions for the local embeddability of more general CR                       structures. Another objective is to generalize an example of a                  locally but not globally embeddable CR structure. Jacobowitz will               also continue his investigations of the prevalence of Fefferman                 spirals and their relations to points of zero Cartan curvature. A               final topic is the study of the conformal class of certain                      singular two-dimensional metrics. Here he will associate with                   each metric a complex vector field and investigate the                          homogeneous solvability of the vector field.",
