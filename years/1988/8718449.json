 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research efforts deal with the relationship between cardiac                 output and pericardial pressure in swimming sharks and continues                preliminary findings of positive pericardial and enhanced venous                pressures during activity.  Using indwelling catheters we will                  measure blood pressures and determine respiratory blood gas                     levels in resting and active sharks and determine rates of                      anaerobiosis as indicated by lactate levels.  Finally we will                   begin to examine effects of P0 , temperature, and swimming speed                on the oxygen consumption rate of swimming Triakis and determine                its aerobic scope for activity.                                                                                                                                 The research deals with the energetics of locomotion in sharks                  using a water tunnel treadmill that has been adopted for                        simultaneous measurement of bloodflow, oxygen utililization,                    swimming motions, heart rate, etc. at various swimming speeds.                  The results are important to our understanding of biomechanics of               swimming in fish.                                                                                                                                               Dr. Louis E. Burnett (University of San Diego) plans to study                   blood gas transport in a number of fish (mainly sharks) during                  exercise in a water tunnel treadmill/respirometer.  Particular                  emphasis will be placed on the role of pH and carbon dioxide                    levels in regulating oxygen delivery to the tissues.",
