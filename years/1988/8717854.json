 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an investigation into the paleoclimatic variations of           The Southern Ocean since the late Miocene (the most recent 10 million           years) through the examination of climatically sensitive parameters             from undisturbed piston cores obtained in the northeastern Weddell Sea          on Leg 114 of the Ocean Drilling Program.  Core recovery at this site           was nearly continuous, and has already yielded a detailed magnetic              stratigraphy to 6.5 million years before present, so that accurate              dating of observed events can be expected.                                                                                                                      Identifying the climatic changes that have occurred, and understanding          the responses of the antarctic current system to these changes is one           of the major objectives of marine paleoenvironmental research.  Such            understanding is based on the detailed study of the sedimentation               history of the region, which includes the location of modern surface            and bottom current pathways, the examination of closely spaced samples          from high quality sediment cores, and the regional correlation of               environmental events.                                                                                                                                           The climate related parameters to be measured include stable isotopes,          percent carbonate and organic matter, silicoflagellates, and                    radiolarian census data.  Paleotemperature estimates will be made from          diatom assemblages, N. pachyderma coiling ratios, and silicoflagellate          species ratios. These have been quite successful when applied to a              somewhat later time frame in the subantarctic region.",
