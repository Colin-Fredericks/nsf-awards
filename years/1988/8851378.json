 "awd_abstract_narration": "Upperclassmen in the sciences need to spend both lecture and                    laboratory time learning how new information is obtained and how to             design and interpret experiments.  The laboratory must provide them             with experience in as many major techniques as possible, performed with         modern instruments.  The college is purchasing a modern ultraviolet-            visible spectrophotometer with computerized data treatment                      capabilities.  This versatile instrument is being used to perform               kinetics and thermodynamics experiments, determine the concentrations           of a wide variety of solutions, record spectra, and manipulate the              resulting data.  The instrument is being used in courses in                     Instrumental Analysis, Physical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Organic                Chemistry, Genetics, and Cell Biology.  In each course, students are            learning to solve at least one laboratory problem and to use the                techniques to solve other problems they will face in graduate school            and on the job.
