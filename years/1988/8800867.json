 "awd_abstract_narration": "The upper atmosphere above about 85 km altitude is called                  the Thermosphere, because it is much hotter than the Mesosphere                 below, with temperatures ranging from about 500K at night at                    minimum solar activity to about 2000K for daytime maximum solar                 activity.  This can be contrasted with Mesospheric temperatures                 in the range 150 to 200K.  The high Thermospheric temperatures                  arise from several sources; the absorption of solar UV and X-rays               during the day; the heating due to particle precipitation and                   electric fields associated with auroral activity; and the                       dissipation of the energy from gravity waves and tides that                     propagates up from the lower atmosphere.  Measurements of the                   temperature of the thermosphere are made by optical                             interferometers and incoherent scatter radars, and latitudinal                  profiles are now available from a chain of four sites extending                 from the equator (Jicamarca in Peru) to Greenland (Sondestrom).                 During a January 1986 campaign anomalously low temperatures were                observed at Arecibo (Puerto Rico), in comparison with results for               the other sites, and it has been theorized that tides (or the                   absence thereof) are the cause.  This award is to perform                       numerical modelling using the facilities of Millstone Hill                      Observatory to test the hypothesis.",
