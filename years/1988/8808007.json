 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atmospheric ozone seems to be increasing in the                         troposphere (where it causes air pollution and is directly                      toxic to plants), but decreasing in the stratosphere (where it                  shields the Earth's surface from harmful solar ultraviolet                      radiation).  We have long recognized the critical role played                   by ozone in the lower and middle atmosphere, but only recently                  have come to understand some aspects of the cycles that control                 its formation and destruction.  This proposal deals with a                      series of experimental projects designed to determine critical                  kinetic and photochemical parameters involving ozone chemistry.                 The latter include the yield of electronically excited oxygen                   atoms following 0.3 photolysis above 300 nm (of importance in                   the troposphere) and below 250 nm (vital in the upper                           stratosphere).  Reactivity of the highly labile atomic product                  with H.20 and HCI will also be examined, with a view toward                     elucidating the detailed mechanisms by which such reactions                     occur.  Such studies will be vital in developing a                              comprehensive understanding of photochemical interferences in                   proposed detection schemes of atmospheric OH by laser.induced                   fluorescence.  Also planned are refinement of off.diagonal LIF                  techniques for detection of OH and O.2, the latter including                    direct measurements of excited state predissociation lifetimes                  (on a picosecond time scale|) critical to the quantification of                 observed spectra.  In addition, we shall continue our initial                   efforts in which the techniques of molecular simulation on a                    supercomputer are applied to the mechanistic examination of                     reactions not conveniently studied in the laboratory.                           Together, these laboratory and computer experiments will                        support the development of field techniques and mathematical                    models used to integrate our understanding of ozone's behavior                  in the increasingly perturbed atmosphere.",
