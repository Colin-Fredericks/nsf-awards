 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to derive effective approaches for                  integration of compiler, microarchitecture and circuit design                   techniques to achieve high performance.  At the compiler level, the             focus is to combine register allocation/assignment and code scheduling          algorithms to exploit architecture parallelism.  At the                         microarchitecture level, the objective is to investigate how various            forms of parallelism (such as pipelining and multiple instructions per          cycle) can be used by the compiler to improve performance.  At circuit          level, the intent is to apply novel memory and logic design techniques          to efficiently support the parallelism in the microarchitecture.                The principal investigator is a junior faculty who has done good                research as a Ph.D. student.  This research project has good ideas and          it is likely that new results will be obtained in an important research         area.  Funding is highly recommended.",
