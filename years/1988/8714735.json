 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lasers provide the chemist with the means of carrying out high                  resolution, high sensitivity experiments using most of the                      infrared spectrum.  If laser instrumentation is combined into a                 laser central laboratory with a \"lending library\" arrangement                   the research of a group of top-notch investigators can be                       effectively enhanced.                                                                                                                                           The Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois will                  use this award recommended by the Chemical Instrumentation                      Program to aid in the acquisition of a series of lasers that                    will provide a continuous wave (cw), high resolution laser                      resource in the near ultraviolet, visible and mid-infrared                      spectral regions for a Shared Laser User Facility (SLUF).  The                  acquisition will also serve to upgrade the pulsed laser                         capabilities of the Facility.  The major areas of chemical                      research that will be enhanced include:                                                                                                                         1)  Dynamics of chemical reactions in the condensed phase.                      2)  High-resolution spectroscopy of mass-selected van der Waals                     and hydrogen-bonded complexes.                                              3)  Dynamics of intramolecular and intermolecular vibrational                       relaxation in gases and liquids.                                            4)  Photchemical kinetics of organic systems.",
