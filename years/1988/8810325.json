 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on collective behavior, examining the                     conditions under which groups of individuals engage in                          protests, riots, and other forms of contentious action in order                 to identify characteristic patterns and common elements of such                 actions.  The study has three principal objectives.  The first                  is to analyze how and why these patterns of collective behavior                 change over time.  The second is to determine why the                           involvement of various types of individuals in collective                       actions changes, with different groups engaged at different                     points in time.  The third objective is to assess the effects                   of various forms of collective action on the interests of the                   individuals involved. These questions are addressed in a broad                  historical context, attending to the implications for                           collective action of changes in the national state and the                      economy.  Dr. Tilly focuses specifically on collective action                   occurring in London during the last half of the 18th century                    and in Great Britain generally during the early part of the                     19th century.  The 1828 to 1834 period is of particular                         interest, since this was a time of political turmoil and reform                 that set the stage for the rest of the century.  The years                      preceding 1828-1834 are also sampled to establish a basis for                   assessing changes up to this period.  Dr. Tilly will draw his                   data from newspaper accounts of contentious gatherings and use                  multiple regression, event history and network analytic                         techniques to analyze the data, with individual gatherings as                   the units of analysis. The theory and findings of this study,                   though historically anchored, bear equally on major questions                   being asked regarding contemporary forms of collective action.                  The analysis of the role of the state and the economy in                        fostering or thwarting such behavior may be especially                          revealing in gaining a deeper understanding of the conditions                   and events precipitating collective action.",
