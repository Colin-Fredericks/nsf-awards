 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chemistry faculty are updating and expanding their chemistry and            biochemistry curriculum.  A high-field Fourier transform NMR                    spectrometer is being used in the teaching of organic chemistry,                physical chemistry, and biochemistry as well as in student-initiated            studies and faculty sponsored research.  The capability of obtaining            high-resolution proton and carbon-13 spectra of complex molecules is            essential in structure determination of natural products, verification          of synthetic products, and the study of reaction mechanisms.  Hands-on          student exposure to a technology as important to the chemical and               biological sciences as high-field NMR is dramatically improving the             teaching of science at Evergreen.  The instrument is being use as the           primary analytical tool in organic chemistry, and is exposing students          in physical chemistry and biological sciences, through specific                 experiments and student projects to the technique.                                                                                                              The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.",
