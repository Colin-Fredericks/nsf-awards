 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will study phenomena associated with the reflection and           transmission of high intensity light at nonlinear interfaces, and the           development of optical devices based on the observed effects.  Because          of its giant nonlinearities, a dye solution will be investigated as             the nonlinear medium, using a CW argon laser.  This offers a unique             opportunity to test existing theories on nonlinear interface effects,           such as bistability, beam trapping along the interface, intensity               dependent k-vector.  To study the more complex dynamics of reflection           at saturable absorption interface, the amplitude and phase of                   reflected and incident ultrashort pulses will be measured, using                single shot diagnostic techniques.  Femtosecond resolved fluorescence           as well as the reflection in amplitude and phase of a probe pulse will          be used to monitor the complex susceptibility of the nonlinear medium           behind the interface.  A new time resolved femtosecond imaging                  technique will monitor the reflected pattern of intensity dependent k           vectors.  Direct applications that will be investigated include the             nonlinear switch active and passive (important for mode-locking                 applications), an energy or intensity limiter, and an induced                   symmetrical waveguide.",
