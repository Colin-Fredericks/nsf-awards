Development               and refinement of large scale computer simulation approaches to                 study phase transitions in systems with competing interactions,                 which are both more realistic as well as more difficult to treat                analytically than more simplistic models, will continue.                        Approaches which will be used include Monte Carlo, Monte Carlo                  Renormalization Group, Molecular Dynamics; and Spin Dynamics                    methods.  Models which will be considered are expected to be                    relevant to magnetic materials, cubic binary alloys,                            physisorbed/chemisorbed monolayers on crystalline substrates, and               disordered media.  Additional effort will be devoted to the study               of linear and non-linear excitations in low dimensional systems.                The results will be compared with those of theory and/or                        experiment.",
