 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of eight U.S. social scientists           in a U.S.-Swiss seminar on cooperative models in international                  relations research to be held in Geneva, Switzerland in December,               1988.  The seminar is jointly organized by Professor Michael                    Intriligator, Director of the Center for International and Strategic            Affairs, UCLA, and Urs Luterbacher, Director of the Center for                  Empirical Research in International Relations, Graduate Institute of            International Studies, Geneva.  The seminar will bring together                 social scientists in various disciplines (economics, political                  science, international relations, game theory, etc.) with a common              interest in cooperative process models, in order to survey the                  current state of such models in international relations research, to            develop new approaches to such research, and to stimulate additional            research in this area.  Participants will consider the causes and               consequences of international cooperation at the superpower, regional           and global levels.  Fundamental but potentially complementary                   differences in methodology between the U.S. and Swiss communities, as           well as the disciplinary diversity of the participants, will enrich             the meeting.  Switzerland has one of the largest concentrations of              researchers in this field in all of Western Europe; much of their               research has involved collaboration between political scientists and            economists.  Swiss researchers are particularly known for the                   development and use of simulation models and other types of dynamic             models that make use of empirical estimates, optimization techniques            and rational choice concepts.  American researchers have developed              and used game theoretic methods, especially repeated non-zero sum               game strategies in their studies of cooperation versus conflict                 scenarios.                                                                                                                                                      The joint seminar should advance the development and synthesis of               models of cooperative behavior applicable to international security,            politico-economic relations and other forms of interaction among                nations.  Its aim is not only to produce explanations of existing               situations but also to generate normative conclusions as to how to              conduct cooperative approaches to international issues, particularly            those of international security and international crisis management.",
