 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate the extent to               which patterns of muscle function in animals can be modified.                   Key general questions addressed by this research include the                    following.  (1) To what extent do patterns of muscle function                   change during development, and what causes the changes that are                 found  to occur?  (2)  To what extent do patterns of muscle                     function differ among both closely related and distantly related                species of animals?  (3) How dependent are patterns of muscle                   function on the environment that animals are found in?  These                   questions will be studied using quantitative techniques to                      measure muscle function and statistically test for differences                  among species, among developmental stages, and among experimental               treatments.  The skull musculature in salamanders and turtles is                used as an experimental system to investigate these questions.                  These organisms were chosen because they allow comparisons of                   muscle function in different environments and muscle function can               be studied throughout development.  This research will contribute               to our understanding of he biomechanics of muscle work in                       vertebrates the physiology of complex movement sequences and the                evolution of feeding behavior in lower vertebrates.",
