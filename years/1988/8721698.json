 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports several research visits by Dr. Vladimir Macko,              Boyce Thompson Institute of Cornell University, to the Swiss Federal            Institute of Technology in Zurich in order to collaborate with                  Dr. Duilio Arigoni in studies of the chemistry and biology of                   host-selective toxins from plant pathogenic fungi.  Collaboration               with Dr. Arigoni, a world reknowned natural products chemist, will              enhance Dr. Macko's long-term domestic research on the mechanism of             action of these toxins which is directed at gaining a better                    understanding of host-pathogen interactions at the molecular level.             The specific experimental objectives of their proposed research are:            1) to isolate and characterize the host-selective toxins from the               plant pathogenic fungus Periconia circinata (PC); 2) to establish               the structure-activity relationship for the PC toxins: and 3) to                prepare a radioactively labeled PC toxin that could serve as a probe            in future studies of its site of action (receptor) in the host                  plant.  Most of this work will be carried out in the U.S.                       laboratory.  Spectral analysis by various methods will be carried               out in both laboratories, and Dr. Arigoni's virtually unique                    expertise in interpreting spectra of the bioactive compounds will be            extremely valuable.  Dr. Arigoni will carry out parallel research on            the chemical and biological synthesis of the active compounds and               their precursors, with concomitant exchange of samples, ideas and               information with Dr. Macko.                                                                                                                                     Despite the contributions of modern, quantitative biology to                    advances in the analysis of the physiology and biochemistry of                  host-pathogen interactions, we lack a basic understanding of                    specificity in toxins and the molecular mechanisms of resistance and            susceptibility.  The elucidation of the molecular basis of                      specificity in host-pathogen interactions is one of the most                    important objectives in contemporary plant pathology, because it                will help in identifying and manipulating the disease reaction genes            and their products.  There is also increasing interest in bioactive             natural products because of their potential applications in                     agriculture and biotechnology.",
