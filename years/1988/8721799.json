 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emissions and subsequent reactions in the troposphere                  of organic compounds from vegetation is an important                            contribution to chemical cycles that lead to the formation of                   ozone and other oxidants and of acidic species.  Knowledge of                   the emission rates of these biogenic compounds is crucial to                    understanding the role of these compounds in the atmosphere and                 to assessing the effectiveness of control strategies based on                   reduction of emissions from anthropogenic sources of volatile                   organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen.  Of these biogenic                    compounds, isoprene is one of the most prevalent emissions from                 vegetation.                                                                               This project involves a closure field study of                        isoprene at a site in a deciduous forest of central                             Pennsylvania.  Isoprene and its immediate oxidation products                    will be monitored so that diurnal concentration patterns of                     these species can be established.  Diffusion rates of gases in                  and above the forest canopy for typical summertime                              meteorological conditions will be determined by tracer                          releases.  Vertical profiles of the concentrations of isoprene                  and important photochemical reactants and of other                              environmental parameters will be measured from towers and                       tethered balloons in order to obtain a mass balance of isoprene                 over the forested area.  The results of this study will provide                 an improved understanding of the fate of isoprene in the                        atmosphere and how this natural hydrocarbon affects key                         intermediates that control the levels of several chemically and                 radiatively important species in the troposphere.",
