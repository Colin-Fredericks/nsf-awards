 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Education for Public Understanding Project (CEPUP) at the          Lawrence Hall of Science will develop interdisciplinary materials for           use at the middle/junior high school level to introduce students to             chemicals and their importance in their lives.  CEPUP materials will            highlight areas of direct societal concern associated with science and          technology.  Students will be given chemistry based activities and              experiments that focus on the environment, biotechnologies, industrial          processes, agricultural practices, alternative energy sources and health        science.                                                                                                                                                        The CEPUP proposal is a three-year project to revise and field test the         four modules produced during the pilot phase, and to develop and                evaluate an additional twelve modules nationally.  The project has              maintained a strong cooperative working relationship with a variety of          school systems and professional organizations and will work together            with these groups and LAB-AIDS, Inc., to insure the long term widespread        dissemination of the materials.  The staff and Lawrence Hall of Science         are considered highly qualified to conduct this product.                                                                                                        The proposal addresses a clear need for improving middle/junior high            science and promises to have a substantial impact throughout the nation.                                                                                        The project's goals are consistent with those of the Instructional              Materials Development Program.",
