 "awd_abstract_narration": "A study will be made of the secretion machinery in E. coli,                     involved in the export of proteins to the cell envelope.  Various               genetic selections and screening procedures to isolate mutants                  defective in components of this machinery.  The mutants will                    define sec genes which will be cloned, sequenced and their gene                 products identified.  The function of the sec gene products will                be studied by examining in vivo phenotypes and behavior of sec                  mutant extracts in an in vitro system.                                                                                                                          New selection procedures will be developed. In one, a selection                 for derepression of a secA-lacZ fusion yields mutations in                      already known sec genes and in a new gene, secE.  In a second                   procedure, selection for the inability to export bacteriophage                  lambda receptor to the outer membrane is carried out after a                    shift to a designated non-permissive temperature.  In addition,                 procedures and mutants will be sought that allow a rapid shut-off               of the secretion machinery after a shift to non-permissive                      temperature.                                                                                                                                                    Mutant selections will be used to define the components of the                  protein B-galactosidase that prevent it from passing through the                cytoplasmic membrane.  These studies may shed light either on the               mechanism of protein passage through membranes or on protein                    folding pathways.                                                                                                                                               This project is concerned with the mechanism by which proteins                  are transported (secreted) across membranes.  Studies on higher                 organisms have led to formulation of the signal hypothesis in                   which the presence of an uncharged hydrophobic peptide (the                     signal sequence) facilitates transmembrane secretion.  Signal                   sequences have subsequently been identified on bacterial                        proteins, thus allowing the powerful methods of bacterial                       genetics to be used to analyze the secretion machinery.  A                      variety of selection procedures will be used to isolate bacterial               mutants that are defective in secretion.  These mutants will                    define the bacterial genes that participate in the secretion                    process and will allow isolation and characterization of the                    products of these genes.  Upon completion, this project will                    provide a detailed picture of protein secretion in bacteria and                 will serve as a model for similar studies in higher organisms.",
