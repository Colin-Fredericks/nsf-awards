 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant continues an observational and theoretical                      program involving a study of the effects of particle                            precipitation at low/mid-latitudes during magnetic storm events.                The aim is to further our understanding of the exchange of energy               between the magnetosphere, ionosphere and atmosphere during                     magnetic storms.  It represents a continuation of efforts                       currently supported by NSF in which the atmospheric emissions at                mid- and low-latitudes are studied using a variety of optical                   instruments.                                                                         The observations are made principally from McDonald                        Observatory in southwestern Texas, where the instrumentation                    views the emission layer at mid-latitudes near 40 degrees                       geomagnetic latitude.  These data have been complemented by                     observations taken at low latitudes from Hawaii and Brazil, which               view the emission layer near 22 degrees and 12 degrees                          geomagnetic latitude, respectively.  Previous studies have led to               a more detailed description of the spectral characteristics of                  the emissions but they have also exposed many questions that need               addressing.  In particular, the ultimate goal is to establish a                 self consistent description of the mid and low-latitude emissions               that occur during magnetic storms and include the properties of                 the more thoroughly described stable auroral red (SAR) arc and                  the type-A aurora that occur at higher latitudes.",
