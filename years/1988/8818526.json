 "awd_abstract_narration": "A previous NSF award (CES-8606118) examined the potential of                    recent advances in Very Large Scale Integrated Circuits (VLSI) to               provide a low-cost high-technology device for measuring                         environmental loads and effects.  Specifically, the objective was to            (1) define the requirements for a data acquisition system to measure            environmental loads and effects, and (2) to interact with researchers           and producers of VLSI Circuits in order to design and construct a               prototype VLSI Circuit to implement this data acquisition.                                                                                                      This action is a specific outcome of that award, and it involves the            GEOS (General Earthquake Observation System) technology developed               by the U.S. Geological Survey to measure earthquake ground                      motions, including the strong ground motions of interest to                     earthquake engineers.                                                                                                                                           The Research Triangle Institute (RTI) is working with the U.S.                  Geological Survey (USGS) toward the development of a plan to                    introduce modern microelectronics technology in to the GEOS data                acquisition system.  The objectives are: 1) to study the hardware               and software of the GEOS system, (2) identify the parts of the                  GEOS system that can be implemented with Application Specific                   Integrated Circuit (ASIC) using VLSI technology, (3) determine the              impact of VLSI technology insertion on the system size, power                   requirements, reliability, and production costs, and (4) identify the           performance enhancements that can be made using modern                          microelectronics technology and additional application areas that can           be served by the enhanced system.",
