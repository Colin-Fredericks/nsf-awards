 "awd_abstract_narration": "A conference will be held in Washington, D.C. in the summer                of 1988 to help guide the future of a highly influential, widely                used data series known as the National Longitudinal Surveys of                  Labor Market Experience (NLS). The conference will bring together               leading academic researchers from the fields of economics,                      demography, and sociology, high-level administrators from federal               agencies which support the NLS, and key staff from the three                    organizations which share operational responsibility for the NLS                to discuss issues of substance and methodology which have arisen                due to existing and predicted resource constraints. Among the                   contemplated outcomes of the conference are the dissemination of                scientific papers assessing the tradeoffs involved in maintaining               vs. discontinuing particular components of the series, vitally                  needed additions to the series for providing information on                     changing economic and social problems, and the establishment of                 priorities for satisfying different research objectives. The                    conference is timely in its emphasis on reassessment as well as                 reaffirmation of the value of the NLS both to social science and                to public decision making.",
