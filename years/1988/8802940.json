 "awd_abstract_narration": "The implementation and performance of intelligent support                  mechanisms for query processing and optimization in deductive                   databases will be investigated.  First, the efficient evaluation                of multiply-defined rules will be examined. The evaluation of                   such rules results in the processing of more than one relational                query.                                                                               In contrast to the traditional single command-at-a-time                    optimization multiple-query optimization techniques can reduce                  the cost of processing a set of queries through sharing of common               execution paths.                                                                     The second major target is the idea of storing results of                  previously processed rules in secondary storage (caching).  Using               a cache, the cost of processing a query can be reduced by                       preventing multiple evaluations of the same rules.  Various                     techniques for implementing efficient caching mechanisms,                       including replacement policies and validation schemes will be                   evaluated.  Addressing the above issues successfully will improve               the ability of future deductive database systems to support non-                traditional application areas, like engineering environments and                artificial intelligence, which require the use of advanced                      control mechanisms such as rules.",
