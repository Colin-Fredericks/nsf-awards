 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award renews support for further theoretical research on dynamic           problems in industrial organization and public finance.  In the area of         industrial organization, the structure of the market in terms of                competitiveness is a key determinant of how firms behave and how                efficiently a market operates.   The first part of this project will            study a market dominated by two firms and will develop and test an              alternative theory of oligopoly behavior.  An oligopoly model will be           constructed with linear demand functions and quadratic production               functions and inventory storage costs.  This model employs fewer                restrictive assumptions than the standard models and will provide a             deeper understanding of behavior of markets dominated by two firms.             The second part of this project involves three studies analyzing the            effects of tax policies in environments characterized by risk.  The             effect  of tax policy on investment and consumption decisions and on            the overall economic performance remains a central issue in the area of         public finance.  Changes in the tax codes are an important source of            uncertainty that will be studied in terms of how frequent changes               affect investment and consumption decisions.  Another study will look           at the effects of the differential taxation of capital gains,                   dividends, and pension type investments on choosing an investment               portfolio.  The third study will analyze optimal tax policy under               situations where government expenditures are subject to sudden,                 unexpected changes.                                                                                                                                             The study of oligopoly in a dynamic setting is important for better             understanding monopolistic competition and the extent to which                  imperfect markets are efficient.  The analysis of tax policy is of              major importance because it may have implications for adopting more             effective strategies of taxation.",
