 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program is in the area of transition metal chemistry.                 The focus of the project is transition metal complexes of                       quinone ligands. Catecholate and o-semiquinone ligands have                     electronic levels which are close in energy to metal levels,                    but which remain discrete in the electronic structure of the                    complex. Quinone complexes often show intense, low-energy                       charge transfer transitions corresponding to transfer of                        electrons between ligand and metal orbitals. Effects which                      influence the relative energy of metal and quinone have been                    investigated in the interest of defining parameters which may                   be used to tune the energy separations, and it has been shown                   that the factors which determine the charge distribution                        between metal and quinone ligands include metal orbital energy,                 the identities of the other ligands and the overall charge of                   the complex. These studies will be extended to planar quinone                   complexes which show strong intermolecular interactions between                 metals and between quinone ligands. The photomechanical and                     conductive properties of these complexes will be investigated,                  with a focus on their application as discotic mesophase liquid                  crystals. Destabilization of oxo ligands of oxometal                            cathecholate complexes by irradiation of the                                    cathecholate-to-metal CT band will be studied in systems which                  exhibit oxygen atom transfer reactions, olefin epoxidation and                  photochemical water oxidation.                                                                                                                                  Learning how to tune the properties of metal atoms by changing                  the molecules to which they are bound is critical to                            controlling their function in catalysts and in coming to a                      better understanding of their function in biological systems.",
