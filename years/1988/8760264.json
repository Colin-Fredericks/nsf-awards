 "awd_abstract_narration": "An evaluation of the feasibility of a new method of oxidation                   reduction of hazardous organics by the use of a sacrificial metal               in a spontaneous process triggered by cementation of a noble                    method will be performed.                                                                                                                                       Effects associated with major process parameters such as pH,                    mixing, atmosphere, etc. on the efficiency and rates of oxidation               reduction of various classes of hazardous organics will be                      evaluated.                                                                                                                                                      The understanding of fundamental relationships between the                      process variables and the destruction efficiency of hazardous                   organics established during this study will be used for an                      intelligent design and application of the new method for various                waste types.  Accordingly, this project will establish the basis                for a large scale demonstration of the proposed new method.                                                                                                     The main benefit of the project to the public is in that, that a                new destructive treatment method of hazardous organics will be                  available to alleviate the national hazardous waste problem.                    Benefits to the industry include cost savings and risk reduction                in handling hazardous wastes.",
