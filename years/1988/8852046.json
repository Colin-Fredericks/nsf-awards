 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Biology Department has identified an opportunity to improve           and diversify its laboratory capabilities in five upper division                biology courses and in the undergraduate student research program.              This entire array of objectives will be met by the acquisition of the           components needed to build upon and complete a sophisticated                    cytophotometer system with fluorescence capabilities; that is, a                functional unit which the Department had previously begun to assemble           with their own resources.                                                                                                                                            The added laboratory activities will include measurements of DNA           content, cell cycle studies, and chromosome analyses in genetics;               cytochemistry and fluorescence microscopy in cell biology; fluorescence         cytophotometry and biotinylated DNA hybridization in molecular biology;         microbe identification in microbiology; indirect fluorescence and               direct immunofluorescence in immunology; and a number of qualitative            and quantitative techniques and additional undergraduate research               options.  Scientific advances in certain aspects of biology which               heavily utilize these techniques coincide very well with the nature of          the curriculum, faculty expertise, and student interest here.                                                                                                        The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
