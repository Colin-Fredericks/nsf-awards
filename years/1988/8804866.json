 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will establish an undergraduate research experience                  site in the Department of Psychobiology in Neural Plasticity and                Brain Function.  The eight-week summer program will begin with a                one-week lecture/seminar series designed to introduce eight                     students to the field and to the research of the various faculty.               This will be followed by an active research experience in faculty               laboratories on a defined project tailored to the goals of                      students and their advisors.  Throughout this period, students                  will continue to interact with faculty in both formal and                       informal meetings.  At the end of the program, students will                    present their findings to other students in the department and to               the faculty.  This proposal is a direct outgrowth of a highly                   successful one-week undergraduate Summer Institute offered last                 year which, upon encouragement from students and faculty, will                  now be expanded into an eight-week program.",
