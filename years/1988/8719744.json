 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of inorganic chemistry and                  in the specific area of organometallic chemistry of transition                  metals. The project is concerned with the tendency of                           transition metal complexes to act as bases, i.e. to accept                      protons from other molecules in solution. Such proton transfer                  reactions are often involved in reactions in which these                        complexes function either as homogeneous catalysts or as                        intermediates in the synthesis of complicated organic                           molecules. Consequently, systematic measurements of their                       basicities are essential both to understanding reaction                         mechanisms and to optimizing reaction conditions for using                      these complexes in organic synthesis.                                                                                                                           The basicities of a broad range of transition metal complexes                   will be determined by measuring their heats of protonation. The                 electronic and steric effects of ligands on complex basicity                    will be determined by examining values of heat of protonation                   for a series of complexes with various P-donor and other                        ligands. In order to understand how metal complex basicities                    influence other types of complex reactivity, rates of a variety                 of oxidative-addition reactions will be determined and                          correlated with heats of protonation. The resulting linear free                 energy correlations are expected to be useful guides to                         understanding a broad range of complex reactivity. In related                   studies heats of protonation will be determined for reactions                   in which a series of di- and polynuclear metal-metal bonded                     complexes are converted to H-bridged products. The latter                       experiments will quantitate the effects of ligands and metals                   on the basicities of metal-metal bonds.",
