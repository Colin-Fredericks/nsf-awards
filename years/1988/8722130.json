 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 1970s saw the first sustained and systematic studies of                     engineering ethics in the U.S., the first efforts to encourage                  engineers to collaborate with scholars from the social sciences                 and humanitis in such studies, and the first efforts to educate                 engineering students about ethical issues.  This project will                   break new ground by planning and developing an Engineering Ethics               Training Seminar.  Faculty from the humanities and engineering                  will develop a two-day seminar designed to introduce engineers to               moral reasoning, moral theories and concepts, and alternative                   models of professional responsibility of engineers.  The seminar                will be tested with four groups of practicing engineers in                      Missouri.  It will continue to be offered after the project                     period, and a plan for identifying and involving national                       societies in undertaking similar programs for their members will                be developed.                                                                                                                                                   Project faculty will develop and distribute seminar materials to                participants prior to the seminar.  The first day will                          concentrate on moral theories and their application to case                     studies; the second day will discuss models of engineering                      responsibility and their application to a major case.  Preseminar               and seminar materials will be packaged and distributed to                       teachers and researchers in engineering ethics.                                                                                                                 This project provides a model for future efforts in ethics                      education for engineers.  The investigators are extremely well                  qualified; institutional support and cost-sharing are excellent.                Results are likely to be widely distributed and advance the field               substantially.  Support in the amount of $31,386 is recommended.",
