 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            designed to increase the participation of minorities in scientific and          engineering research.  The program provides support to strengthen the           research environments and capabilities of institutions that have                substantial minority student enrollments.  Eligible institutions must           also have graduate programs in science or programs in engineering.              Texas A&I University will use RIMI support to establish a laboratory            for Intelligent Controls research involving dextrous robotic hands and          neural networks.  Research studies will focus on robotic systems,               automated manufacturing, and machine intelligence.  Subprojects will            involve:  dynamics, sensor, and control issues related to smart                 (robotic hands for grasping and manipulation); neural networks sensor           integration and intelligent control applications; and use of                    artificial intelligence to analyze flexibility in automated                     manufacturing cells.                                                                                                                                            This project on intelligent control systems will help meet the                  research needs of a predominantly minority institution that is                  striving to increase its research productivity.  The principal                  investigator has a strong background in classical dynamics and                  controls and in the applications of neural networks.  The Foundation            has supported this project, in part, because minority students at               Texas A&I University will have their research capabilities                      strengthened by their involvement with state of the art                         instrumentation for intelligent control research.",
