 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Spiegel plans to continue his research on the                           biochemistry and morphology of cell adhesion during early sea                   urchin development using the living sea urchin embryo as well as                cultured cell types.  This research has the following specific                  aims:                                                                           A. To define micromere specific proteins.                                       B. Using the information obtained in A. to ask whether an animal-               vetegal polarity of these proteins exists and is set up in the                  ovary, egg or cleavage stages and whether it is a general                       phenomenon.                                                                     C. To use the reagents generated from A. (monoclonal antibodies)                to ask whether one can specifically perturb the system in order                 to define the function(s) of these proteins in development.                     Specific experimental approaches include: the use of monoclonal                 and polyclonal antibodies and of lectin-binding to study the                    appearance, cellular distribution, and function of these                        specific proteins; and the use of various inhibitors to block                   gastrulation.  The proposed research will involve Nomarski and                  fluorescence microscopy, electron microscopy, antibodies, SDS-                  PAGE electrophoresis, lectins, surface iodination, and cell                     culture.                                                                        %%%                                                                                 During the development of the new individual the fertilized                 egg divides many times to form a multicellular embryo.  These                   embryonic cells undergo considerable rearrangements of position                 with respect to one another by changing their cell-cell adhesions               and by changes in motility. The morphological and molecular basis               of the changes in cell adhesion which occur in early development                is one of the most important problems in developmental biology.                 The sea urchin embryo is a model system for studying such cell-                 cell interactions since the embryo can be dissociated into a cell               suspension which can reaggregate to form an almost normal looking               embryo. Dr. Spiegel will investigate the origin and development                 of a specific cell type, the micromere, in the 16-cell stage sea                urchin embryo. This cell type ultimately gives rise to the                      skeleton. He will prepare and use antibodies to micromere cell                  surface molecules to carry out these studies.",
