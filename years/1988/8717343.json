 "awd_abstract_narration": "Iodine is a reactive element which participates in many                 different classes of reactions in waters, soils, sediments, and                 the atmosphere.  It has been implicated in a variety of                         important processes which control the stability of pollutants                   in the atmosphere and the solubility of toxic metals in the                     ocean.                                                                                  This proposal has as its main objectives (1) the                        determination of the speciation of iodine in sedimentary pore                   waters and solids, (2) the identification of the major classes                  of reactions which control iodine speciation and distribution                   in sediments, and (3) determining the kinetic factors                           controlling iodine distributions in the environment.  The                       results of this study will have utility in predicting both the                  distribution of iodine in the sediments, and, by analogy, the                   iodine distribution in soils, surface waters, and groundwaters                  as well.                                                                                The proposed studies involve the determination of the                   speciation and distribution of iodine in sediments under a wide                 range of environmental conditions (Eh, ph, and temperature).                    Sediment samples will be incubated at in situ temperatures in                   the laboratory to determine the rates of production and                         consumption of total dissolved iodine and some individual                       reactive iodine species.  Laboratory studies will be made of                    the interaction of iodine redox chemistry with the chemistry of                 other redox-sensitive species normally present in sedimentary                   pore waters.                                                                            Together the results of this research will lead to a                    better understanding of iodine geochemistry and the way in                      which environmental conditions may control iodine cycling and                   the cycling of other important solutes.",
