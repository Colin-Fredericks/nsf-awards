 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diffusion of Al and Si in network structures is greatly enhanced                at pressures greater than 10 kbar in the presence of hydrogen, and              the rate of the order-disorder reaction in feldspar is                          accelerated enough that structural state equilibration of some                  compositions was achieved, in the absence of water, at                          temperatures as low as 650oC.  Further, direct anhydrous oxygen                 isotopic exchange between carbonates and silicates can be carried               out.  Hydrogen activated high-pressure diffusional enhancement                  will be pursued in this project in several directions: a)Reaction               mechanisms. b) Structural state equilibration.  c)  Equilibrium                 oxygen isotope fractionation factors between CaCO3 and quartz,                  albite, anorthite, grossular will be further refined, and extended              to magnetite, layer structures and amphiboles.  d)  The                         hydrothermal melting relations of KAlSi3O8 at high pressures will               be investigated.  Speeding up these diffusional mechanisms by the               presence of hydrogen will permit us to determine, in laboratory                 time scales, natural reactions that occur in geologic time.",
