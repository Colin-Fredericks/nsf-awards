 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research supported by the National Science Foundation                 under the Materials Processing Joint Initiative.  The objective                 of the research program is to study the epitaxial growth of thin                film diamond and boron nitride using laser-induced photolytic and               pyrolytic methods.  The thin films are metastable at room                       temperature and atmospheric pressure, thereby requiring non-                    equilibrium methods to grow them.  Pulsed laser irradiation                     introduces heating and transient atomic excitations locally to                  form the metastable phases.  The materials will be grown                        epitaxially on magnesium oxide and silicon carbide on silicon                   substrates, where there are sets of major lattice planes which                  match those of the thin films.  The diamond films will be doped                 during in-situ laser chemical vapor deposition by introducing                   dopant gases into the growth chamber.  The emphasis in the                      research will be on the fundamental aspects of epitaxial growth,                to include analysis of the formation of defects, and the effects                of distribution of elastic strains and interfacial stresses. The                thin films will be characterized using high-resolution and                      analytical transmission electron microscopy,  Rutherford                        Backscattering Spectroscopy, Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy,                   Scanning Auger Electron Spectroscopy, Electron Spectroscopic                    Chemical Analysis, and Raman and infrared spectroscopy techniques               will be used to characterize the chemical composition and the                   bonding characteristics.  Some of the films will be evaluated for               mechanical and electrical properties.                                                                                                                                Diamond and boron nitride are the hardest of all materials                 known to man, and are useful in applications such as cutting                    tools and wear resistant coatings.  Other useful properties of                  diamond include high dielectric strength, chemical inertness,                   optical transparency, large band gap, high electrical                           resistivity, and high thermal conductivity.  These properties                   make the material potentially useful for semiconductor devices                  for operation in high temperature and high radiation                            environments.",
