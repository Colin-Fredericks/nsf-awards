The coverage of topics             will be broad, and current research in the fields of heavy ion                  collisions at high energy, cosmic ray research, theory of quark gluon           plasma physics will be discussed.  It is planned that 15 U.S.                   scientists will be covered by this grant.                                                                                                                       Scope:  The conference is the second international meeting dealing with         an important topic of much recent theoretical and experimental work in          this area of fundamental research in physics aiming at better                   understanding of the states of matter.  Considerable theoretical work           is being carried in India in the field of Quark-Gluon Plasma at the             Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and at MATSCIENCE in Madras and          in Calcutta at the Saha Institute.  Experimental work is carried out at         TIFR, and at the High Altitude Research Laboratory of Srinagar.  India          served well as host for several physics conferences in recent years.            This project can lead to strong interaction between the participating           U.S. scientists, their Indian hosts and the international physics               community.  It is likely that these interactions will lead to further           collaborative research in this area of physics.",
