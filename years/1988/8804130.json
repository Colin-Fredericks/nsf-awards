 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will collect and study the Jurassic flora            which was recently discovered in one of the allochthonous pre-Tertiary          terranes in the Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon.  A preliminary           examination of several small collections of these fossils has shown             that the flora consists of both well preserved leaf impressions and             permineralized wood representing a variety of ferns, seed ferns,                cycadophytes, ginkgos, and conifers.  A detailed study of this flora            will provide new data to test the hypothesis that the pre-Tertiary              terranes in the Blue Mountains originated in a near-equatorial location         and were subsequently displaced hundreds or even thousands of                   kilometers before colliding with the North American craton sometime             during the Mesozoic.  Also, the work will establish the age of the              flora, information which should shed light on the timing of the                 movements of these terranes.  The project will emphasize a comparison           of the Blue Mountain flora to other Mesozoic floras to which it might           possibly be related, especially the Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous               floras that have been described from many localities around the rim of          the Pacific Ocean basin.  In addition, the general paleoclimatic                requirements of the flora will be evaluated in order to learn something         about the climatic regime in which it probably lived.",
