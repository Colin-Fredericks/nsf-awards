 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project for research at the interface of two                     areas of mathematics, Banach space theory and probability                       theory. The former has to do with the convergence of series.                    Classically, the terms of the series are functions, but                         there is a conceptual advantage in taking them simply to                        be vectors in an abstract Banach space. Respecializing,                         the terms of the series can be random variables, whose                          study is at the heart of probability theory. This point                         of view has lately turned out to be very fruitful.                                   More specifically, Professor Talagrand will continue                       the introduction of new combinatorial and isoperimetric                         methods in probability theory. A particular objective                           is better understanding of necessary and sufficient                             conditions for sample boundedness of p-stable processes.                        He will also tackle a famous open problem in Banach                             space theory having to do with the classical space                              of absolutely integrable functions on the unit interval.",
