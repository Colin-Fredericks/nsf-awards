 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Janet                Pierrehumbert of AT&T Bell Laboratories and Professor Gunnar Fant,              Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, in the area of linguistics.           The aim of the project is to establish rules for the influence of               intonation patterns in speech on the perceived characteristics of the           voice source.  As a first step, intonation patterns will be related to          detailed characteristics of the air flow in the throat.  Experiments            will be carried out in which the important factors affecting                    intonation, such as stress pattern, choice of melody, and pitch range,          are varied independently.  The air flow will be analyzed non-invasively         by using already-known functions to transform between the sound                 actually produced and air flow details.                                                                                                                         Studies will be made using both English and Swedish speakers, taking            advantage of the very different intonation characteristics of these             languages.  The Swedish collaborator has pursued studies on the effects         of speech patterns on air flow and therefore has direct experience with         the measurement and use of these flows for speech characterization.             The description of air flows developed by the Swedish investigator will         be combined with the linguistic model of intonation developed by the            U.S. investigator.  This research may lead to important applications in         the fields of linguistics and speech synthesis.",
