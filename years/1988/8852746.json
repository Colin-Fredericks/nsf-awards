 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scientific equipment provided by this award enhances the               quality of introductory and advanced courses in archaeology and                 physical anthropology by enabling undergraduate students to experience          hands on use of instruments in the classroom, laboratory and field              program settings.  Two surveying instruments, a theodolite and an               alidade, greatly improve student competence in field situations                 involving archaeological surveying and mapping and expand the range of          their performance to include skill in the use of equipment common to            Old World as well as New World archaeology.  The microscopes provide            laboratory opportunity for students to observe and identify cellular            structure and histology of bone tissue and the nature of wear patterns          on hominid teeth. Physical anthropology students use the calipers and           microscope provided to measure and examine specimens in the search to           identify and distinguish different species of human and nonhuman                primates.                                                                                                                                                            The award will be matched by an equal amount from the grantee.",
