 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is mathematical research in the representation                theory of Lie groups.  A suitable example of the latter is the                  group of rotations of a sphere.  Groups like this are important                 because they occur in many areas of mathematics (e.g. geometry,                 differential equations, algebraic number theory, mathematical                   physics) as groups of symmetries.  Representation theory allows                 one to take advantage of symmetries in solving problems.                             More specifically, Professor Wolf will complete work on an                 extension of the theory of Harish - Chandra to general real                     semisimple Lie groups.  He will complete the development of                     certain important consequences of the recently developed duality                between two constructions of Harish - Chandra modules.  He will                 complete and apply the results of a project that shows in a                     rather explicit way how all the usual analytic and geometric                    constructions of admissible representations are equivalent for                  reductive Lie groups.  A further aspect of his research plan                    concerns the interplay between representation theory and complex                analysis.",
