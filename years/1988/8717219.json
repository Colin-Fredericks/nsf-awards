 "awd_abstract_narration": "Meaningful participation by U.S. astronomers in the meetings of                 the International Astronomical Union is important.  Over one-                   quarter of the active U.S. research astronomers are working on                  projects in collaboration with foreign scientists.  Several large               foreign instruments which have unique capabilities are routinely                used by U.S. astronomers.  The largest and most important                       international meeting is the General Assembly of the International              Astronomical Union (IAU).  In 1988 the General Assembly will be                 held in the United States; providing an unparalleled opportunity                for young U.S. astronomers to meet and develop working                          relationships with their counterparts from foreign countries.                   Unlike many other international scientific unions, the IAU                      emphasizes scientific sessions and presentation of research                     results.  The IAU also stresses attendance and full participation               by young scientists.  It is important for the continued health of               astronomy in the U.S. that American scientists be able to                       participate in these meetings.                                                                                                                                  The American Astronomical Society (AAS) will organize a program of              grants for travel to attend the IAU General Assembly.                           Applications for travel to the General Assembly will be accepted                by the AAS, and awards will be decided by a selection committee                 chosen by the U.S. National Committee for the IAU.  The travel                  grant program will be publicized by the AAS at its meetings and                 through continuing announcements in the AAS Newsletter.",
