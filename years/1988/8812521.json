 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigation of Jacobi-type methods for the solution of the                algebraic eigenproblem on parallel architectures is proposed here.              Both symmetric and non-symmetric problems are considered, as is the             generalized problem.  Interest in this general area of numerical linear         algebra has increased markedly since parallel machines appeared on the          market; these machines already play an important role in scientific             computing, and parallel algorithms present an important challenge.                                                                                              Jacobi-type algorithms are ideally suited for a parallel multiprocessor         environment; recently they have been found competitive with standard            serial methods on both shared memory multiprocessors and serial vector          machines for the singular value problem.  New approaches are shown              which lead to an extension to the eigenvalue problem for both symmetric         and non-symmetric matrices.                                                                                                                                     One-sided Jacobi methods are introduced here, and compared with block           Jacobi                                                                          implementations.  These methods may be regarded as a factored form of a         sequence of similarity transformations which may be extended to non-            unitary transformations.                                                                                                                                        Probably the most important goal of the project is the experimental             comparison of Jacobi methods with other methods which have become               standard for serial computation on both the symmetric and non-symmetric         eigenvalue/vector problems.^R                                                   JUSTIFICATION",
