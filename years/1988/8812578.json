 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project uses ethnographic methodology to study language and                literacy use in two concentrated Mexican American neighborhoods                 in Chicago.  Data will be drawn from audiotapes, participant                    observation, and interviews of two subgroups of the larger speech               community: working-class adult immigrants who have limited                      experience with literacy/education, and US-born adults whose                    Hispanic style of literacy may differ from the US mainstream                    model.  Particular attention is paid to persuasive use of talk,                 focusing on those aspects of this type of speech event that                     contrast most sharply with the academic mainstream model of                     expository speech and prose.  In addition to analyzing persuasive               speeches as communicative events, the project investigates the                  literary practices in Spanish and in English, of both target                    groups, as well as their attitudes toward bilingualism and                      biliteracy.  This study expands linguistic understanding of                     language-use in culturally non-mainstream communities in the USA                and also provides information for educators adapting literacy                   instruction to Mexican Americans.  NSF funding for this project                 will be supplemented by support from the US Bureau of the Census                because of its interest in under-reported minorities.",
