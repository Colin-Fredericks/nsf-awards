 "awd_abstract_narration": "The George Washington University, through its Institute of                 Reliability and Risk Analysis, will collaborate with the                        National Bureau of Standards and conduct a \"Conference on                       Uncertainty in Engineering Design\".  The aim of the conference                  is to provide an opportunity for statisticians and engineers to                 discuss modern statistical methods and their application to                     product engineering and process design.                                              The discussions will concentrate on five major                             topical areas which are of prime importance today in the                        engineering and statistics communities.  These are: 1)                          achieving quality through design in manufacturing, 2) achieving                 quality through design for chemical processes, 3) statistics in                 design for flexible automation, 4) uncertainties in design                      optimization, and 5) statistical issues in integrated circuit                   design and fabrication.  The conference will motivate important                 interactions among members of the technical community concerned                 with improving product quality and industrial competitiveness                   of American manufacturers.",
