 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is designed to elucidate the function of the dnaB gene               of B. subtilis in the regulation of DNA replication and its                     relation to cell growth. The dnaB gene is required for the                      initiation of DNA replication and for the attachment of the                     origin of replication to the cell membrane.  An attempt (i) to                  isolate the product of the dnaB gene; (ii) to characterize the                  gene product biochemically; (iii) to characterize the abnormal                  products of plasmid DNAs which replicate in the absence of dnaB                 function; (iv) to examine the effect of the dnaB gene on the                    expression of an RNA encoded near the oriC; (v) to examine the                  mode of expression of the dnaB gene during cell growth.  The                    long-term goal is to understand the molecular bais of the                       regulation of chromosomal replication and determine how                         replication is coupled to cell growth.                                                                                                                          Replication of bacterial DNA usually starts at a unique site, the               origin, and proceeds bidirectionally around the circular genome                 to the termination site.  After completion, the daughter                        chromosomes are partitioned into the daughter cells that result                 from cell division.  An important step for both replication and                 partitioning of the daughter chromosomes is attachment of the                   origin to the cell membrane.  Dr. Watabe will investigate a gene                in B. subtilis, dnaB, that is required for both initiation of                   replication and membrane attachment.  His major goal is to                      isolate and characterize biochemically the protein encoded by the               dnaB gene.  This study should provide basic information about the               control of cell proliferation in bacteria and may serve as a                    model for understanding regulation of cell division in higher                   organisms.",
