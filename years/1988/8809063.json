 "awd_abstract_narration": "The U.S. Pulp and Paper is an industry in the midst of                          contradictions.  On the one hand it is based on a renewable                     natural resource which currently is the best on the planet, and,                up until recently, could deliver pulp and paper anywhere in the                 world at a price which was less than pulp and paper could be                    produced locally.  The result was a U.S. industry which, at least               on average, was profitable and provided a major contribution to                 the U.S. balance of payments.                                                                                                                                   On the other hand the U.S. Pulp and Paper industry has come under               serious international competition in recent years.  In the short                term this resulted from the strong dollar of 1984 which,                        unfortunately, allowed domestic customers to become acquainted                  with the quality and variety of grades of paper from other                      countries and so has had to have had some potential for a lasting               effect; and in the long term it has resulted from intensive                     research/development/national support in other countries with                   important pulp and paper industries which has increased                         substantially the competition from abroad.                                                                                                                      A planning workshop will be held in 1988, at the University of                  Maine to conduct discussions by experts in pulp and paper                       research and its management which will lead to an integrated                    statement of the research needs of the U.S. Pulp and Paper                      industry and identify those on which government, industry and                   academia could best mount cooperative efforts.                                                                                                                  Seven categories have been defined for group discussion of                      research needs.  Individuals have been identified to organize and               lead the discussions.  The role of each category in affecting the               performance of the industry will be studied and discussed.                                                                                                      A Workshop Proceedings will be prepared to bring together the                   discussions and recommendations of the Workshop.  These                         Proceedings will be distributed to key organizations in the U.S.",
