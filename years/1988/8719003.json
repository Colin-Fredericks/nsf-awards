This is to include a review of the current                status of the subfields of hydrology and of their coupling with                 related geosciences and biosciences, the identification of                      promising new frontiers and opportunities for the hydrologic                    sciences to help improve water and environmental management, and                development of the appropriate framework for hydrologic education               and research (including funding needs).  The study results from an              increased awareness by the hydrologic community of the growing                  need for fundamental advances in hydrologic science to generate                 solutions to emerging complex problems of water technology, and                 from the realization that the time has come for hydrology to take               its place as a science alongside the other established and                      recognized geosciences.                                                                                                                                              The study will assess our understanding of the natural                     reservoirs and fluxes involved in the global hydrologic cycle.                  The focus will be on continental waters and the natural processes               driven by continental waters, such as erosion, sedimentation,                   vegetation growth, and chemical weathering.  Consideration of                   oceanic, lacustrine, atmospheric, and cryospheric reservoirs will               be limited to their interfacial fluxes.  The scales of concern                  will vary from the micro-processes of the soil moisture to the                  global scale of hydroclimatological change.  The study will be                  carried out by a specially appointed multidisciplinary committee                of approximately 16 scientists representing fields ranging from                 hydrology, geomorphology, geochemistry, and hydrogeology to                     meteorology, hydroclimatology, and ecosystem science.                                                                                                                It is expected that the effort will result in an important                 reference work on opportunities in the hydrologic sciences.  This               publication will be of guidance value to science policy makers and              government managers--of cultural importance to scientists,                      educators, and students--and of interest to the informed lay                    public.  The document will transmit the flavor and importance of                the hydrologic sciences, identify the needed improvements thereto,              and contribute ultimately to improved management of water and the               natural environment.",
