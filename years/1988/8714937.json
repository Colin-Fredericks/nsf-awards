 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent observations and theoretical ideas suggest new ways of                   investigating the inner structure of quasi-stellar objects (QSOs).              A spinning, massive black hole seems the most plausible way to                  explain radio jets (beams) and, through accretion,  the enormous                luminosities of quasars from radio to beyond X-rays.  If the                    accreting gas has angular momentum it will probably form a disk                 about the spin of the hole.  New evidence for relativistic beaming              of the radio emission from quasars' cores supports the idea of a                \"Unified Scheme\" that explains core-dominated quasars as the                    double, lobe-dominated quasars seen end-on and allows us to use                 the radio structure to determine an approximate orientation of a                quasar to the line-of-sight.  Recent observations suggest an                    axisymmetric structure for the narrow and broad emission line                   regions (NLR and BLR) and alignment with the radio axis.  If this               \"Unified Scheme\" is correct, new observations imply a beamed                    optical continuum, important in the core-dominated quasars but                  insignificant in the lobe-dominated quasars.  New multi-frequency               observations of continuum energy distributions suggest that                     thermal and other emission from an accretion disk dominates the                 optical to far ultraviolet spectrum, while hot dust or free-free                emission dominates in the near infrared region.                                                                                                                 The research will test the \"Scheme\" and explore the consequences                of changing inclination for quasars' inner regions by spectro-                  photometry and polarimetry designed to separate continuum                       components in the IR-UV, and by observations of emission line                   spectra and radio, optical and X-ray luminosities in carefully                  defined quasar samples.  These observations can be compared with                new kinematic models for the ionization of an axisymmetric broad                line region by a disk or \"jet\" continuum.  If the \"Scheme\" is                   incorrect, then these observations will test the very strong link               between the radio, optical and X-ray properties, and so help                    define future hypotheses.",
