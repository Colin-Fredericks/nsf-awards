 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall purpose of this project is twofold: (1) to develop a                model of people's intuitive understanding of chemical risks and                 toxicological principles; and (2) to compare this model with that               of expert toxicologists and risk assessors.  Specific objectives                of the study are (1) to develop a better understanding of how                   laypersons and experts assess toxicological risks, (2) to                       investigate differences in risk perceptions within the expert and               lay communities, and (3) to conduct empirical studies that                      examine the knowledge base and conceptual frameworks used by                    experts and laypeople to assess chemical risks.                                 Despite the importance of understanding public perceptions of                   chemical risks, little research has been directed toward this                   end.  This innovative study will provide information important to               both risk analysts and decision makers.  Specifically, it will                  clarify the nature of the cognitive frameworks used by laypersons               and by experts to assess risks. It will also  contribute to the                 development of more effective risk communication about the risks                and benefits of chemical hazards.",
