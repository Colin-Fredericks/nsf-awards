 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new approach for dealing with large scale software system is                  investigated.  The central concept of this approach is that of a law-           governed system (LGS).  Informally, a law-governed system can be                described by means of the following equation                                                                                                                                      law-governed system = system + law                                                                                                            where the law is an explicit and strictly enforced set of rules about           the structure and operation of the system, about the way the system is          to be used and modified, and about the allowable modifications in the           law itself.  In other words, under the LGS approach, the conventional           notion of a system is augmented by a new component called the law of            the system, which regulates both its operation and evolution.  It is            intended to build a programming environment, called Darwin, to support          this approach.                                                                                                                                                  The concept of law-governed system appears to have a wide range of              applications, ranging from controlling the operation of programs --             traditionally the domain of programming languages -- to controlling the         process of development of large scale systems -- traditionally the              domain of software-development environments and managerial disciplines.         Specific contributions to software engineering are expected to include:         general and flexible module-interconnection schemes, global treatment           of exception handling, an object-oriented language which supports a             wide variety of inheritance schemes in a unified manner, ability to             monitor and audit the operation and the evolution of programs, etc.             Perhaps the most interesting, and potentially useful, result expected           from the proposed approach is that an evolving system could be made             into a single \"organism\" which would exhibit a degree of predictability         and coherency throughout its evolutionary lifetime.  This result, which         has no counterpart in conventional technology, is particularly                  important for systems that must provide long term, virtually                    uninterruptable, support for an enterprise.",
