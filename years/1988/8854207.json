 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will combine undergraduate students with                      undergraduate faculty into teams which will explore supercomputing              through training and research.  Undergraduate students will learn the           principles of supercomputing and, with their faculty advisor, formulate         and execute a research project.  Undergraduate faculty will have the            opportunity to investigate supercomputing and to integrate that                 technology and methodology into their curricula.  Specifically, a four-         week Summer Short Course, \"Supercomputing Tools, Methodologies and              Applications\", will be given for students at Cornell University.  Work          on the research projects designed by the attending teams will begin             during the course and continue throughout the subsequent academic year          under the supervision of the faculty advisor with the continuing                support of the Cornell National Supercomputer Facility (CNSF) staff.            Progress will be monitored through a series of reports and at a midyear         convocation of the participants.  Technical support and supercomputer           resources will provided by the CNSF.  Administration will be handled            through this project's nationally-derived Steering Committee.                   Instruction will be by qualified persons experienced in undergraduate           education, especially with respect to computing and numerical analysis.                                                                                              By taking the unique approach of combining students and faculty to         introduce the concepts and practice of supercomputing into the                  undergraduate experience, this proposal offers a special opportunity to         those universities and colleges that may not have an emphasis on                research or computing in their curriculum.  By encouraging the                  integration of the materials provided through this program and the              original courseware developed by participating faculty into the                 undergraduate curriculum, this program will stimulate the growth of             undergraduate learning and interest in the technologies of computing            and applications in research.                                                                                                                                        In addition to the NSF grant, participants' institutions will              provide about 15% in travel costs toward the operation of the project.",
