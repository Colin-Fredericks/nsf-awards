 "awd_abstract_narration": "The northwest Himalayan molasse basin provides an excellent                setting in which to delineate the stratigraphic and structural                  evolution of a foreland basin in collisional regime.  Exposures                 are excellent, and because of the youthfulness of the basin, the                interrelationships between the sedimentary and tectonic record are              readily discernable. Magnetostratigraphic studies have provided                 reliable, quantitative chronologies for over 40 individual                      sections across the Potwar Plateau and adjacent regions.  Until                 now the extraordinary potential for re-creating a detailed history              of basin development based on these chronologies has remained                   largely untapped.  We propose to utilize this temporal control to               reconstruct the depositional and structural history of the                      foreland basin at discrete time intervals (~ every 1.5 Ma) from 12              Ma to present.  We intend to analyze 1) the development of the                  fluvial dispersal system through time, 2) the geometric evolution               of the basin as a response to imposed loads, and 3) the history of              structural disruption of the proximal foreland basin.  Precise                  chronologic constraints on the stratigraphic record are presently               available and provide an unparalleled opportunity to generate a                 detailed, time-controlled regional synthesis of the dynamic                     evolution of the Himalayan foreland basin.  These data should                   produce quantitative and conceptual stratigraphic/structural                    models that will serve as paradigms for the analysis of older,                  more dissected basins.",
