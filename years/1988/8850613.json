 "awd_abstract_narration": "This prototype project includes several activities to strengthen                minority education from the early grades through the baccalaureate              degree. It was developed under the leadership of California State               University-Los Angeles, with cooperation from other California State            University institutions in the Los Angeles Basin, the Los Angeles               School System, and business and industry. During the first year of              operation, a set of activities, based on science and mathematics                experiences, and designed to nurture, encourage and motivate minority           students, are being implemented. These include a Minority Math/Science          Program, a retention activity focussed at the undergraduate level,              which is patterned after a successful, ongoing Minority Engineering             Program established earlier in the region. Critical elements of this            program include academic support, tutoring, personal counseling, a              student study center, summer job placement assistance, and                      participation in student organizations. At the precollege level, a              Saturday Science Project for elementary school students and teachers is         being offered. Science Skills Centers which offer enriched classroom            experiences for students and provide a setting for undertaking                  improvements in junior high mathematics are being established. In               addition, a Summer Science Institute is being conducted in which                curriculum development activities occur, through joint efforts by               university and precollege faculty.",
