 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues research into the operation of labor markets.            Under the previous award the investigator published a number of papers          focusing on a variety of related topics including: (a) the determinants         of earning and the distribution of income, (b) an analysis of the               impact of manpower training programs on earnings, the value of                  longitudinal data, and the more general issues of the econometrics of           selection-bias models, (c) the development and testing duration                 analysis models.                                                                                                                                                This project will extent the previous work in terms of three broad              topics.  The first is on the development and assessment of                      non-experimental estimators for selection-bias problems.  The                   methodology is applied to the further evaluation of the impact of               manpower training programs on earnings, employment, and unemployment.           The benefits of various types of econometric estimators will be                 assessed.  The benefits of longitudinal and experimental data well also         be explored, and data sets analyzed in the previous work will be                re-analyzed and a  variety of new estimators will be developed.  The            second topic is on econometric duration analysis.  An estimator for             duration models using data with unobservable components will be                 developed and evaluated.  The third topic focuses on the analysis of            black wage-structures and earnings in the South Carolina labor market           during the 1910 to 1980 period.  Data from this period will be used to          assess the relative importance of government pressure, the growth in            schooling, and secular and cyclical market factors in accounting                for the breakthrough in black employment and wages observed in that             state during the mid 1960's.",
