 "awd_abstract_narration": "From previous work on mutant induction in maize with EMS, one ear               was found which segregated for kernels with orange                              pigmentation in the pericarp (Neuffer and Chang, 1986).  The                    segregation ratio was 15 normal to 1 orange, indicating                         duplicate unlinked factors (designated orp1 and orp2).  These                   factors have been located to chromosome arm; orp1 on 4S and orp2                on 10L (Neuffer, Beckett and Wright, 1987).  Since the pericarp                 is maternal, diffusion into the pericarp of a                                   substance from the underlying filial tissue of the doubly                       homozygous recessive combination is implied.  The                               pigmentation is restricted to the pericarp, suggesting that                     thesubstance which diffuses into the pericarp is not the  pigment               assuch but rather a colorless precursor which is  converted                     afterentry into the pericarp.  Plants from mutant  kernels                      growpoorly, are somewhat adherent and have thus far  died                       beforereproducing.  The mutant kernels have a somewhat                          flouryendosperm, perhaps a secondary effect of the biochemical                  lesion. The research proposed is to biochemically characterize                  thismutant through the identification of the orange pigment                     andprecursor and through rescue by exogenous feeding.  Linkage                  analysis of both factors will be undertaken as well as                          transposon tagging of the orp2 locus.  Cloning and                              characterization of the locus and its message is the ultimate                   goal.                                                                                                                                                           Preliminary data suggest that this mutant could be a                            tryptophan auxotroph.  If the biochemical characterization of                   this corn mutant supports that hypothesis, this will be the first               true auxotrophic defined in a commercially important plant and as               such, this work could have tremendous impact  bothat a                          fundamental and practical level.",
