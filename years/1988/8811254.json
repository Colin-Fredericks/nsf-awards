 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Initiation Award focusses on high frequency                       electromagnetic studies of high-transition-temperature                          superconductors, between frequencies covering \"dc\" to 75 GHz.  The              proposed work involves: (1) Fundamental studies of the electromagnetic          response via measurements of the surface resistance and the                     penetration depth as functions of temperature, frequency and applied            magnetic field.  The results will be interpreted to yield fundamental           information regarding the nature of the superconducting state, and the          dynamics of vortices and fluxoids in these materials. (2)  Materials            fabrication and processing in bulk monolithic, single crystal forms             and also coatings.  The effects of materials processing on the ideal            high frequency response of the superconductors will be studied.  (3)            Fabrication and testing of devices in bulk monolithic and coated                forms.  The specific devices that will be studied are: high Q fully             superconducting cavities at microwave and mmwave frequencies,                   interdigital filters, and waveguides at X-band and higher frequencies.          the device performance will be determined, correlated with expected             ideal estimates, and the effects of materials processing will be                examined.",
