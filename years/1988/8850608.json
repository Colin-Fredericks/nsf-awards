 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will enhance the use of data in the making of informed             policy and programmatic decisions at the national, state, and local             levels by disseminating information on the status of science and                mathematics education.  Initially the project will be based on the              recently completed report of the l985-86 National Survey of Science and         Mathematics Education.  Later, other studies such as the National               Assessment of Educational Progress(NAEP), the international science and         mathematics assessments, and state data gathering programs will be              included.  The participants in the project will include national                professional organizations, state science and mathematics supervisors           and others interested in the status of science and mathematics                  education.  Each participant will be provided with briefing books which         summarize the data through pie charts, bar graphs, and tabular results          presented in the form of transparency masters and camera ready copy.            Basic training in survey design will also be provided so that policy            makers and program personnel will be better able to judge the adequacy          of survey efforts and decide when policy changes are indicated.",
