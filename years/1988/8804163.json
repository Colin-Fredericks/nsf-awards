 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1985 and 1986 with NSF support, Dr. Smith conducted an                       archaeological survey and excavation in the Morelos region of                   Mexico.  After a first season of survey, his team excavated a                   sample of eight house remains at the site of Capilco and 21 at                  Cuexcomate.  From these large samples of ceramics, lithics and                  other cultural remains were recovered.  During the late Post                    classic period when these sites were occupied, the Morelos region               was incorporated into the Aztec empire.  The goal of the research               was to understand social and economic organization at the                       household and community levels in a rural setting and to trace                  their changes through time, in response to both local and broader               trans-regional factors such as the Aztec incorporation.                                                                                                         Dr. Smith and his collaborators will now analyze the large corpus               of materials collected.  In an attempt to refine the chronology,                they will characterize ceramic assemblages and incorporate                      surface material into the excavated sequence.  They will also                   obtain radiocarbon dates as well as hydration dates from obsidian               tools.  Petrographic analyses on ceramic remains will permit                    sourcing and thus provide information on trade networks and                     extra-regional relationships.  It will also permit determination                of vessel function.  Analysis of metallic objects will allow                    reconstruction of manufacturing techniques.  Faunal and human                   skeletal remains, also recovered in the course of excavation,                   will also be studied.                                                                                                                                           This research is important because it will increase our                         understanding of the interaction between elite urban centers and                their rural hinterlands.  In many developing nations (and in such               first world countries such as Spain) similar situations exist                   today, and the urban-rural tensions are clear.  Archaeology                     provides a valuable insight into such issues because of the long                term data it provides.",
