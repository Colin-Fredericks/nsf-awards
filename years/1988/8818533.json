 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this grant is to provide support for the development of          an assessment framework addressing environmental and health risks               associated with the deliberate release of biotechnology products.               Despite rapid growth in biotechnology sales and development, accepted           guidelines for evaluating the risks of genetically-altered organisms            that are deliberately released into the environment do not exist.  As a         result, neither government nor private agencies are able to assess              adequately whether the analysis of a planned release is thorough and            competent, and the public therefore may be unable to place the risks of         biotechnology within a realistic perspective.                                                                                                                   The proposed project requires the researchers to assess a number of             important issues that involve both theoretical and applied questions of         great interest to the scientific community.  For example, what                  characteristics of the organism are of greatest concern to the public?          What features of the environment need to be taken into account?  How            can the scale and anticipated risks of the release be described in              meaningful terms?  Answers to these and related questions will be based         initially on the assessment of past releases of modified organisms and          an analysis of the current risk assessment requirements of regulatory           agencies; this initial information base then will be used as the basis          for developing an improved risk assessment framework.",
