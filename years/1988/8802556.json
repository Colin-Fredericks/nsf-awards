This research in the general area of statistics aims to come               to grips with a broad variety of mathematical and methodological                problems that have been encountered in current efforts to extend                statistics to a broader variety of applications.  Included are                  major thrusts to develop sequential methods for analyzing data,                 with the potential for saving resources in scientific                           experimentation.",
