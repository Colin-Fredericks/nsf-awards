 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to improve the accuracy,                    reliability, and availability of meteorological measurements                    and air-sea flux estimates made from buoys and ships.                           Specifically, over the three year period of the project, the                    effort would:  (l) Focus on improving the sensors used for                      meteorological measurements from buoys and ships with emphasis                  on adding humidity and longwave radiation, and on reducing and                  quantifying errors in both long and shortwave radiation                         measurements.  (2) Use a commercially available, IBM PC                         compatible processor and motion and attitude sensors for                        intelligent data acquisition; and incorporate commercially                      available hardware for telemetry of the data from the buoys and                 ships.  The power and flexibility of the processor would be                     exploited to further reduce error in the measurements.  (3)                     Quantify the accuracy of the basic measurements made by the                     sensors and of the resulting estimates of the air-sea fluxes by                 conducting laboratory, dock, and field calibrations and                         intercomparisons.  (4) Deploy, on a dedicated, local surface                    mooring and on moorings and ships of opportunity, buoy                          meteorological systems and ship meteorological systems for                      longterm testing in order to discover and then correct problems                 that would, in such use, reduce the accuracy and reliability of                 the measurements.                                                                       The work on this project includes strong scientific and                 technical cooperation with scientists at the University of                      California at San Diego and the University of Southern                          California. That work is supported under subcontracts.  The                     overall project is a long lead effort of the World Ocean                        Circulation Experiment (WOCE).",
