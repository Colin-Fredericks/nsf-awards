 "awd_abstract_narration": "This institution specializes in training future communications             professionals, among whom are significant proportion of minorities.             The Science Department provides instruction in basic science which is           integrated with the students' communications specialties through the            preparation of reports such as videotapes or films on individual                research projects.                                                                                                                                                   One of the shortcomings of the students' training has been the             lack of experience with modern instrumental techniques.  The                    instruments purchased through this project have applications in all             Biology laboratory courses, and are available for use in students'              research projects.  As a result of this improved science training, it           is expected that graduates, in their future careers in communications,          will be able to report more effectively to the public on matters of             science and technology.                                                                                                                                              The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
