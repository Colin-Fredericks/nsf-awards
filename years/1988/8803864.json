 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for an REU site for 4 students to take place during               the summer of 1988 at Fordham University.  The research problem                 arises in algebraic topology, specifically homotopy theory, a                   field of pure mathematics usually considered to be well beyond                  the undergraduate curriculum.  This question is within range of                 undergraduates because it can be reduced to a computer search for               certain kinds of matrices.  In algebraic topology, questions                    about a topological space are translated into questions about                   algebraic objects, usually Abelian groups.  These Abelian groups,               and homomorphisms between them, can in turn be represented as                   matrices and matrix operations.  This allows for computer                       representation and manipulation.  The undergraduates will design                algorithms and implement them on a computer to search for a                     certain kind of topological object, called a nilpotent complex.                 By attacking the problem algorithmically, the undergraduates will               pioneer a new approach to questions about these spaces.                         Specifically, the project seeks to answer an unsolved question                  about the existence of finite three-dimensional nilpotent                       complexes.",
