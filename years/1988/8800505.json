 "awd_abstract_narration": "A system or subsystem may be termed \"safety-critical\" if a                 run-time error or failure can result in death, injury, loss of                  property, or environmental harm.  One approach to building such                 systems is to eliminate or minimize the probability of hazardous                conditions occurring that could lead to accidents.  The long-term               goal of this research is to provide a methodology, including an                 integrated tool set; for building such systems that ensures that                the risk of harm caused by the computer is acceptable.  Previous                work has involved formal modeling and analysis procedures for                   identifying software hazards and safety-critical software                       requirements, analyzing software requirements for completeness                  and robustness, verifying and assessing safety, and designing                   safety into software including run-time support environments and                software fault tolerance.  This research will extend these                      techniques to distributed systems and apply the requirements                    analysis procedures to a family of requirements specification                   languages.                                                                           The interactive component involves teaching a graduate                     course in software reliability and safety, giving guest lectures                at area universities, and initiating productive interaction on                  safety-related work in the field of testing with women faculty                  and researchers.                                                                     This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1)                 to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                  engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF                  and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and                     engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists                and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic                    institutions.  By encouraging the participation of women in                     science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future                     scientific vitality.",
