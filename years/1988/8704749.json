 "awd_abstract_narration": "Changes in the earth's climate are expected to be large and             rapid.  One of the feedbacks that affects the rates of these                    changes is the response of the world's terrestrial ecosystems,                  but it is not clear whether in the short term these responses                   will enhance or retard the CO2-caused warming.  The objective of                this project is to examine this question.  The approach is to                   model terrestrial metabolism seasonally and to compare the                      computer seasonal flux of CO2 with the concentrations of CO2                    observed in the atmosphere.                                                             The approach will be used at two levels of resolution.  At              coarse resolution, seasonal metabolism will be modelled for a                   single unit (an ecosystem, a region, or a hemisphere).                          Preliminary results suggest that the approach is useful, for                    example, in distinguishing among alternative explanations for the               increased seasonal amplitude of atmospheric CO2 concentrations.                         The more detailed resolution required modelling the                     seasonality of the earth's metabolism with geographical detail,                 and will compare modelled CO2 fluxes with the observed seasonal                 and geographic variability of CO2 concentrations.  This                         comparison will use an existing atmospheric transport model.  In                preparation for this global analysis, the research will compare                 modelled CO2 fluxes for specific sites with recorded ambient CO2                concentrations measured at those sites.  The hypothesis                         throughout is that information in atmospheric CO2 concentrations                can be used to suggest the response of terrestrial systems to                   global change.                                                                          The project team is excellent and will experienced in this              type of research and may be expected to produce results of high                 quality.  The institutional setting for the project will provide                excellent scientific interaction and a synergistic environment of               colleagues and related research.                                                        The Ecosystem Studies Program recommends that funding be                made available for the first year of this three-year continuing                 award.",
