 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Project is in the area of the Chemistry of Life Processes                  and is supported jointly by Chemistry and Biochemistry.  It                     involves the production of antibodies that are potential                        enzyme-like catalysts.  The project is directed toward the use                  of monoclonal antibodies to simulate the features of enzymes by                 exposing them to antigens that mimic the transition state of                    the desired chemical reaction.                                                                                                                                  Catalytic antibodies that take advantage of transition metal                    ions as Lewis acids might simulate the activity of a wide                       variety of metalloenzymes catalyzing important chemical                         transformations.  The transition state of such processees is                    obtained from the complex consisting of the substrates                          coordinated to the metal ion through a reactive functional                      group.                                                                                                                                                          Antibodies made against metal chelates with substrate-like                      ligands may act as metalloenzymes by favoring assembly of the                   substrates and metal cofactor in the combining site through                     antibody-assisted chelation.  The chemical process is allowed,                  then dissociation of the complex releases the products.  This                   project is a continuation of one previously supported by the                    Foundation grant DMB-8607352.",
