 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of the Foundation's Biotechnology Initiative, the                  Division of Ocean Sciences has been advocating an initiative in                 marine biotechnology. The conceptual framework and tools of                     contemporary molecular and cellular biology have led to great                   advances in modern life sciences from biomedical and                            developmental biology to taxonomy and evolutionary biology.                     These concepts and technologies will yield significant advances                 in environmental sciences (biological oceanography and ecology),                but the transfer of technology/training is only slowly                          proceeding.  As part of the development of marine biotechnology,                the Division seeks advice from both the ocean science community                 and from leading innovators in environmentally relevant                         molecular/cellular biosciences on how best to accomplish the                    transfer of meaningful and effective technologies to the pursuit                of questions in ocean ecology.  This workshop will gather                       representatives from industry, academia, and government agencies                to address this transfer of knowledge and the need for enhanced                 support of marine biotechnology.",
