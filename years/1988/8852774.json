 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fourier transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy is being              incorporated into the chemistry program.  Acquisition of the instrument         is modernizing the way NMR is taught in the laboratories associated             with Physical, Organic, and Analytical Chemistry as well as the course          for nonscience majors.  In addition the Instrumental Chemistry and              Spectroscopy lecture courses and the student research program are being         impacted.  The acquisition is consistent with the department's effort           to provide state-of-the-art instrumentation for both the year long and          summer student research program.  On average since 1980, thirty-six             chemistry majors  (35% women)  graduate yearly from the program with            20% going on to graduate school.  Since almost all of the                       undergraduates enroll in research courses and are utilizing the                 instrument, it is having a positive impact on the continued competence          of the chemistry majors.
