 "awd_abstract_narration": "Damage to the freeway bridges in the Whittier Narrows earthquake                of October 1, 1987 was one of the most significant aspects of                   damage to engineered structures designed for seismic lateral                    loads.  Of particular importance was the performance of the                     I-605/I-5 separator, which was extensively damaged during the                   earthquake and came perilously close to collapse at a time when                 freeway traffic was at its heaviest and loss of life would have                 been extensive.                                                                                                                                                 The research project is directed to a study of the performance of               freeway bridges in the Whittier Narrows earthquake.  The research               involves five stages:  observed damage assessment, component                    strength and deformation analysis, dynamic analysis of selected                 bridge structures, recommendations on assessment and evaluation                 and prioritization for retrofitting.  The intention of the                      research is to obtain maximum benefit from the lessons emphasized               by bridge damage in the earthquake in the form of improved                      understanding of the vulnerability of existing bridge structures                to seismic damage, calibration and assessment of analytical                     techniques for analysis of seismic response of bridge structures,               and in the development and assessment of retrofit techniques to                 reduce the seismic risk of freeway bridges.",
