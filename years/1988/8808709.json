 "awd_abstract_narration": "Condensation polymerization in a melt-phase process is used to                  manufacture, for example, thermoplastic polyesters (polyethylene                terephthalate) and polyamides.  These polymers are used in packaging            (beverage bottles), fibers, films, and adhesives.  The manufacturing            process requires continuous removal of the condensation product from            the reaction mass to drive such reversible reactions to high                    conversion.  Typical polycondensation reactor configurations include            twin screw and multiple screw extruders, twin shaft paddle mixers,              horizontal disc-ring reactors  and stirred tanks with an anchorage              agitator.                                                                                                                                                       The primary objective of this research project is to gain a                     fundamental understanding of the reaction kinetics, mixing, and mass            transfer  which occur in the manufacture of high viscosity                      condensation polymers using melt-phase processes.  Current design               procedures are empirical and inadequate for the increasingly higher             viscosity polymers being manufactured today.  Another factor is that            present commercialization pressures involve shorter and shorter                 product development times.  This research program will consist of               three components.  Experimental mixing data will be generated for a             disc-ring reactor.  This data along with reaction rate and diffusion            parameters will be incorporated into a mathematical framework which is                                                                                          capable of predicting the overall reaction rate                                 in a polycondensation reaction system.  Finally, the model will be              partially                                                                       validated by comparing it against experimental devolatilization rate            data.",
