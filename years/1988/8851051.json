 "awd_abstract_narration": "The North Carolina Council on Minorities in Science, Mathematics and            Industry, jointly organized by the Governor's office, North Carolina            State University, and the state Department of Community Colleges, is            working with 17 school systems and 55 industries to increase                    technological literacy of junior/senior high school students and to             increase the number of minorities entering technical, scientific, and           engineering trades and professions.  Through this program, the Council          will enhance local understandings of the importance and relevance of            modern technology by developing greater technological literacy among            teachers and students and extending that literacy to the general public.        Activities with teachers will include placing teachers in summer                internships in industry, development of technology education materials          through joint efforts of these teachers and industrial scientists and           engineers, and providing in-service programs for sharing these materials        with other teachers.  Students will use these materials in science and          mathematics courses and in new or expanded courses in Principles of             Technology courses.  Industry on Parade exhibits, rotated among                 different sites in the state, will be a part of the program by bringing         to the general public as well as to students and teachers an improved           appreciation of the nature and importance of modern manufacturing and           product technology.                                                                                                                                             Cost sharing by the partners will total 245% of the NSF funding.",
