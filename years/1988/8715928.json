 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support U.S. participation in a seminar on                      \"Earthquake Prediction Research,\" organized jointly by Professor                Hiroo Kanamori of the California Institute of Technology and                    Professor Takeshi Mikumo of the Disaster Prevention Research                    Institute, Kyoto University, Japan.  United States and Japanese                 participants will meet in Monterey, California in September 1988.               The seminar will address the use of real-time earthquake                        information for hazard warning and prediction.  The principle                   topics to be addressed are (1) earthquake prediction experiments in             the Parkfield, California and Tokai, Japan regions, (2) rapid                   retrieval of earthquake source parameters and application to hazard             warning and prediction, (3) new developments in earthquake                      prediction studies, (4) sociological impact of earthquake                       prediction and warnings, and (5) rapid response during and after a              large earthquake.                                                                                                                                               This joint U.S.-Japan seminar will be the seventh in a series of                conferences on the subject held under the U.S.-Japan Cooperative                Science Program over a period of more than 20 years.  Japan and the             U.S. are the only countries in the world with large-scale,                      real-time earthquake prediction and monitoring capabilities.  It is             anticipated that the seminar will lead to improved earthquake                   prediction and hazard reduction programs in both countries.",
