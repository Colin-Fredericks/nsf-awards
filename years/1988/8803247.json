 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term objective of the proposed research is to gain a                   further understanding of rhizobial bacteroid differentiation,                   a process essential for the development of effective                            nitrogen-fixing nodules on the roots of leguminous plants.                      Several lines of evidence have indicated that the cell-                         envelope composition of the Rhizobiaceae provides an                            essential function in this important microbial-plant                            symbiosis.  The experimental plan will focus upon the                           characterization of the phospholipid and cyclic glucan                          oligosaccharide content of the cell-envelope of species of                      Bradyrhizobium.  In addition, the phospholipid metabolism of                    the bradyrhizobia will be examined as well as the enzymic                       activities associated with the biosynthesis of the cyclic                       glucans of these bacteria.  Experiments are based upon                          preliminary studies by the applicant that have indicated that                   the phospholipid metabolism of species of the Rhizobiaceae is                   intimately linked to the biosynthesis of the cyclic glucans                     of these bacteria.  An important aspect of the proposed                         studies will be the examination of bradyrhizobial                               phospholipid and cyclic glucan content before, during, and                      after the induction of nitrogen-fixation in free-living                         microaerobic cultures.%%%                                                                                                                                       The availability of water and a source of combined or fixed                     nitrogen represent the two most limiting factors in                             agricultural productivity.  Because crop plants are not able                    to fix nitrogen, it must be provided in fixed form.  This may                   be accomplished through the use of industrially synthesized                     nitrogen fertilizer, however, this synthetic process                            represents a very costly one in terms of the expenditure of                     fossil fuels.  An alternative mechanism for acquiring fixed                     nitrogen has evolved in which certain plants are able to                        participate in a complex symbiotic relationship with                            nitrogen-fixing bacteria.  The symbiotic relationship between                   leguminous plants and members of the family Rhizobiaceae                        represents not only an important source of globally fixed                       nitrogen, but also the most well-studied example of such                        symbiosis.                                                                                                                                                      The overall goal of this project is to gain further                             understanding of rhizobial bacteroid differentiation - a                        process essential for the successful development of nitrogen-                   fixing nodules on the roots of leguminous plants.***//",
