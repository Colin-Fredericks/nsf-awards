 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is being introduced into the            undergraduate curriculum.  The use of an FTIR affects more laboratory           courses than any other instrument that could be purchased by the                department.  In general chemistry the students are being introduced to          the matching of an unknown spectra with a library.  The characteristics         and theory of FTIR are being studied in Instrumental Analysis.  The             quantitative and qualitative aspects are being used in organic,                 qualitative organic, polymer chemistry and in the undergraduate                 research program.  Physical characteristics of chemical bonding and             kinetics are being studied in physical chemistry and inorganic                  synthesis.  The students are gaining a deeper appreciation and broader          perspective of modern high technology which should increase their               enthusiasm for chemistry.  The technique which is widely used in                industry and graduate research is allowing the students to have hands           on experience using a computer controlled data manipulation device that         is one thousand times faster than a dispersive infrared instrument.                                                                                             The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.",
