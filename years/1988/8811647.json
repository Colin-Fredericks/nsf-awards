 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research in fluid mechanics is to increase                the output and fuel economy of an internal combustion (IC) engine               by examining the exact flow inside an engine thereby enhancing                  the mixture of the incoming air and fuel.  Better mixing means                  more complete burning of the fuel which also implies safer                      emissions.                                                                      Current techniques involving the fluid mechanics of engine flows                are limited particularly in capturing important information                     regrading fluid turbulence.  A new technique has been developed                 at Michigan State University involving a laser beam which is                    divided to form a grid of intersecting lines in the engine.  With               this new technique a wide variety of engine diagnostics and fluid               mechanics will be performed.  Using the velocity gradient in the                region of the grid obtained by the new techniques, the strain                   rates and vorticity quantities will be determined.  Internal                    engine design would benefit using these quantities since it would               be possible to optimize scavenging of the cylinder of burnt gases               and minimize mixing with the burnt charge.  The new technique                   offers improved possibilities for pre-combustion mixing of air                  and fuel.",
