 "awd_abstract_narration": "A study is proposed at improving knowledge of rain rates,               remineralization rates, and burial rates in the abyssal                         environment, and extending understanding of the processes which                 control these rates and thereby fix sediment composition.  The                  three fluxes will be measured in a 19-station transect across                   the equatorial Pacific, from 15oN to 15oS at 135oW.  This                       transect crosses gradients in major parameters governing fluxes                 at the seafloor, including wind patterns (controlling aerosol                   input), surface water productivity (controlling rain rates of                   biogenic constituents), and botton water CaC0 3 undersaturation                 (governing CaC0 3 preservation).                                                        The experiment plan involves determining benthic fluxes                 of major biogenic constituents (from high resolution                            interfacial pore water studies) and sedimentary accumulation                    rates of aerosol and biogenic constituents (from studies of                     sediment compositition and sedimentation rates).  Rain rates                    will be calculated as the sum of the benthic fluxes and                         accumulation rates.  Aerosol samples will be collected along                    the cruise track for subsequent mineralogical and chemical                      analyses.                                                                               The results will contribute to several major problems in                oceanography.  First, they will greatly extend knowledge of the                 rain rates of biogenic constituents by providing data for an                    important area encompassing a range of globally important                       uppper ocean and deep ocean regimes.  Second, the results will                  provide data for testing and extending models and hypotheses                    about the processes which govern the rates of benthic processes                 and the chemical composition of the sediments.  Finally, the                    data will provide detailed information on the contemporary                      relation between upper water column processes, atmospheric                      circulation, and sediment deposition in the study area, thereby                 dramically enchancing our ability to do paleoceanographic                       reconstructions in the equatorial Pacific.",
