 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the relatively unexplored area               of how beliefs, knowledge, decisions and actions of people in the               process of becoming middle school teachers of mathematics change                during their training and first year of teaching as they begin to               make the transition from novices to experienced teachers.  In                   conceiving the study, these investigators bring together the                    concepts of (1) teacher beliefs and knowledge, (2) decisions and                instruction strategies used by teachers, and (3) environmental                  influences including both contextual and social factors present                 in the schools where teachers study and work.  These are used to                form a framework for understanding the changes over time in the                 manner in which new teachers identify and respond to situations                 in which problems and opportunities arise during instruction.                   The study will employ a case study approach to describe the                     detail and complexity of the succession of decisions and actions                of novice teachers during the final year of preservice                          preparation and first year of teaching middle school mathematics.               Particular attention will be given to the ways these teachers                   plan, implement, and reflect upon the mathematics instructional                 units they teach.",
