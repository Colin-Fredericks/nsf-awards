The three-week residential program will focus on a study of mathematics         topics with a secondary focus on applications in physics.  Computers            will be used in the mathematics problem solving process. A secondary            focus of the program is an exploration of careers in the sciences and           engineering.  Field trips to a school of engineering and at least two           major industrial sites will allow participants to interact with                 scientists, engineers, and personnel directors in the workplace.  A day         of \"shadowing\" with area scientists and engineers is planned.",
