The Conference will convene April 5-8, 1988, in                     Cardiff, Wales under the auspices of the Society for Applied                    Bacteriology (SAB), the Society for General Microbiology (SGM)                  and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM).  The Conference                has as its goal to serve as a forum for scientists throughout the               world to discuss recent advances in microbial ecology and                       molecular biology as they relate to environmental releases of                   genetically engineered microorganisms.  The conference program                  will consist of three morning sessions of invited speakers.                     Roundtables are scheduled for the afternoons and posters will be                on display throughout each day.  The Conference will enable                     scientists with different educational backgrounds and experience                to interact so each can benefit from the special knowledge of the               other.  Adequate American participation in the Conference is of                 special concern, because the issue of environmental release                     relates directly to the capacity of this country to maintain its                present competitive advantage in molecular biology and                          biotechnology as applied in the agricultural, environmental and                 medical sciences.",
