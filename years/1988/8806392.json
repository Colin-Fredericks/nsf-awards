 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. John Atwood of Selby Botanical Gardens is beginning the                first phase of a projected six-year project to catalogue the                    estimated 1400 species of orchids of Costa Rica.  The first years               will emphasize field collecting in three poorly sampled regions                 of the country along with compilation of a genus-level inventory                with identification keys and brief descriptions of morphology and               habitat.  Further work will involve study of herbarium specimens                in major collections in the U.S. and Europe in order to determine               species-level characters for recognition and identification, to                 prepare illustrations, map geographical distributions, and                      compile observations on habitat and ecology.  The taxonomic                     inventory of the orchids will be the largest major treatment for                the on-going Flora Costaricensis project.  More biological field                research is taking place in Costa Rica than in any other tropical               country.  The need for critical taxonomic information of use to                 ecologists and other biologists, resource managers, park                        officials, and interested citizens is great.  This project will                 provide information on the single largest family of flowering                   plants in Costa Rica, many of whose species are of interest to                  conservationists and others concerned with rational stewardship                 of natural biotic resources.",
