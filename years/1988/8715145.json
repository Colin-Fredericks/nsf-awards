 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in applied and                   computational mathematics between two groups of U.S. and French                 scientists, based at the University of Indiana at Bloomington and               the French National Institute for Information Science and                       Automation (INRIA).  The U.S. group will be led by Professor David              Hoff; on the French side the project will be led by Dr. Bernard                 Larrouturou, INRIA, Sophia-Antipolis and Dr. Roger Temam,                       Laboratoire d'Analyse Numerique, University of Paris-South.  The                research will focus on a number of problems concerning reacting and             nonreacting fluid flows.  The project is subdivided into the                    following areas:                                                                         1. Navier-Stokes equations and turbulence                                       2. Numerical methods for reaction - diffusion systems and                          combustion problems                                                          3. Reacting and nonreacting compressible flows                                  4. Flows of collisionless plasmas and the Vlasov-Maxwell                            Equations                                                                                                                                          This research joins two groups of outstanding U.S. and French                   applied mathematicians.  INRIA is widely recognized for its                     concentration of expertise in computer research, automation,                    mathematics and scientific computing; it provides an excellent                  combination of fundamental research with industrial collaboration               in these areas.  This award will allow fruitful collaboration to                continue in the important area of fluid mechanics and combustion                theory.",
