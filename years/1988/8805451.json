 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop and test a methodology for the                        identification and analysis of morphological features on                        crystalline and glassy juvenile tephra from two calssic                         pyroclastic deposits:  1) the 1980 products of Mount St. Helens,                and 2) the A.D. 79 deposits of Vesuvius.  A wide range of                       deposits from lahars to plinian falls were produced by these two                events.  The stratigraphy and eruptive phenomena of both deposits               have been well studied and characterized.                                       Collective features of primary grain-surface morphology will be                 interpreted in terms of the successive changes in the character                 of these two eruptions.  The relative effects of mechanical and                 chemical processes on grain surfaces will be traced through the                 eruption, transportation, deposition and cooling of the tephra.                 Data sets of sufficient pyroclasts from every major stratigraphic               level of these deposits will be examined to identify key textures               useful for interpretation of environmental histories.  In                       addition, experimental studies will be done to investigate the                  morphology of hot fragments quenched in water, and the textures                 produced by abrasion of primary clasts in a specially designed                  device.                                                                         Development of a methodology for pyroclast morphologic                          investigation and verification of the results using computer                    analysis are integral parts of this study.  Various techniques                  for analysis of tephra morphologies will be tested to determine                 which are best suited to determine the history of the deposits                  from the characteristics of the individual components.",
