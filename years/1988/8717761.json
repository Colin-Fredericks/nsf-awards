Although the                  study of the senescence of neuroendocrine systems is in its early               stages, research into this phenomena has accelerated at an                      amazing pace.  The participants in this symposium include                       established senior investigators and younger scientists who have                made significant contributions to their field of study.  Their                  role will be to summarize and evaluate the progress that has been               made in studies on aging in their area of expertise, to suggest                 new models for the study of development and senescence, and to                  chart new directions for future research.",
