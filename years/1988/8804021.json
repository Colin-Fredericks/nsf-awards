 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide continuing support for a Research                       Experiences for Undergraduate Site at Augustana College.  This                  project will support undergraduate participation in a focused                   research program which integrates the research activities of six                investigators, four from Augustana College, one from St. Olaf                   College, and one from The Nature Conservancy.  The projects are                 integrated at the scientific level because of the common                        interests in prairie ecology and paleoecology and because aspects               of each project benefit form the applications of the stable                     isotopes of C and N to the research methodology.  This program                  will provide a coherent group and a unique methodology to                       approach paleoecological reconstructions in a geographic area of                rich ecological resources.                                                                                                                                      Nine students will study field and laboratory problems with a                   common focus.  They will be expected to gain some mastery of the                theoretical basis for their study as well as the experimental                   design and ultimate interpretation.  Weekly seminars and                        workshops will review each project's theoretical basis and                      research design; enhance the students' library, laboratory and                  data handling research skills; and broaden their understanding of               the related projects.  The ten-week summer program will be                      followed by a January Symposium in which each student will                      present the interpreted results and conclusions and help develop                the hypotheses and research designs for the on-going projects.",
