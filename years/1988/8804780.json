 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            designed to increase the participation of minorities in science and             engineering research.  The program provides support to strengthen the           research capabilities of institutions that have substantial minority            student enrollments.  Eligible institutions must also have graduate             programs in sciences or programs in engineering.  Investigators at              Meharry Medical College will use RIMI support to continue research in           hybridoma and flow cytometry technology.  Hybridoma technology permits          the development of hybrid cell clones and monoclonal antibodies while           flow cytometry allows the sorting of cells into populations and                 subpopulations.  This work will lead to the continuing development of           a competitive and productive hybridoma laboratory facility.                                                                                                     The hybridoma and flow cytometry research laboratory is a centralized           facility  that assists researchers with the generation, production,             and application of hybrid cell products by providing tissue cultures,           media preparation, cell harvesting, and monoclonal antibody detection.          The laboratory will meet the research needs of a productive                     institution that educates minority students in cellular and molecular           science.  The principal investigator was part of the Meharry team that          received earlier Foundation support to design and establish the                 hybridoma laboratory.  He has published several articles in refereed            journals on cell biology.  This RIMI project will use a hybridoma               laboratory facility to encourage more minorities to select careers in           science.",
