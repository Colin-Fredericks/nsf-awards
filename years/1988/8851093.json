 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Gardening Association will provide teachers with a familiar        teaching medium, an indoor garden laboratory, to excite children about          science inquiry.  Through the special design of the Grow Lab, students          will be able to quickly grow vegetables and flowers through full life           cycles, from seed to seed, in the classroom.  This curriculum encourages        the integration of science with other subjects in each classroom day.                                                                                           The purpose of Grow Lab is:  1) to establish and reinforce early in life        that problem solving and scientific inquiry are fun, and not just for           scientists; and 2) to teach a variety of science skills and concepts,           not limited to plant science, using plants as the tool with which young         children learn to make sense of their world.  The National Gardening            Association will develop, evaluation and disseminate three Grow Lab             science activity guides for elementary and middle school.  Activity             kits, a teacher newsletter, a series of wall charts, a teacher training         videotape, an extensive Grow Lab certified instructor program and a             national marketing plan in conjunction with Hubbard Scientific will also        be completed.                                                                                                                                                   The National Gardening Association has an excellent reputation in the           quality and impact of their materials.  The staff for this project are          both experienced and highly qualified to conduct these activities.                                                                                              This project affords a unique and extremely promising program to                stimulate and provide an enjoyable applied context to learn science             using the familiar environment of gardening.  The project's goals are           consistent with those of the Instructional Materials program.",
