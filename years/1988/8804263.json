 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical chemistry,                    broadly defined.  During a ten-week period between 1 June 1988 and              31 August 1988, five faculty members from colleges that do not                  offer the PhD degree in chemistry will carry out collaborative                  research on various aspects of bioanalytical chemistry with ten                 faculty members from the Center for Bioanalytical Research (CBAR)               at the University of Kansas (KU).  Research participants will be                selected from among those who respond to KU's announcement of the               summer research program; this announcement has been targeted at                 ten midwestern states in the vicinity of Kansas.  This activity is              analogous to the support of faculty from undergraduate                          institutions through NSF Research Opportunity Awards (ROAs).  In                this project, however, participating faculty from the                           undergraduate institutions will not have necessarily prearranged                their summer research activities with particular CBAR faculty                   members.  Rather, they will establish their collaborative                       arrangements after they have had an opportunity to consider fully               all of the research programs of the host institution participating              faculty.  In addition to the research thrust of this program, CBAR              faculty will present a series of tutorials covering current                     research tools and topics that constitute modern chemical                       analysis, with particular emphasis on research opportunities in                 bioanalytical chemistry that could be implemented subsequently at               the home institutions of the participating undergraduate faculty                members.  Also, representatives from Federal and private sector                 funding agencies that have strong commitments to the support of                 quality research programs in undergraduate institutions will                    address the participants and describe opportunities whereby such                support can be competitively sought.                                                                                                                            This three-year project can be expected to lead to the attraction               of increased numbers of students into careers in analytical                     chemistry by beginning to establish a network of vital, academic                analytical chemists at undergraduate institutions in the midwest.",
