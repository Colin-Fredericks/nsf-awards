 "awd_abstract_narration": "This department is committed to bringing quantitative depth and            rigor to students' visual data by installing three complementary                systems:  (1) a computerized image analyzer;  (2) a color video camera          and recorder; and  (3) Nomarski optics to upgrade an existing phase-            contrast microscope.  This equipment, along with a fluorescence                 photomicroscope obtained through a NSF grant in 1985, enables the               immediate introduction of image analysis into these laboratory courses:         Cell Biology, Immunology, Genetics, Plant Biology, Biological Systems,          Contemporary Biology for non-majors, and Senior Research.                                                                                                            Computerized image analysis enables students to accurately and             rapidly measure the size, shape and density of microscopic and some             macroscopic objects, to statistically analyze these data, and to                incorporate images and statistics into a single computer-generated lab          report.  The project enables both upper- and lower-level biology                students to transform initial qualitative perceptions of visual data            into statistically-supported conclusions.                                                                                                                            The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
