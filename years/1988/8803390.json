 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfields of photochemistry and surface                    reaction dynamics.  The research continues the Principal                        Investigator's studies of the photofragmentation, via internally                repulsive states excited by an ultraviolet laser, of molecules                  adsorbed on metal and semiconductor surfaces.  Photofragmentation,              which generates radicals important in surface reactions, can                    proceed on these surfaces even in the presence of very fast (250 -              2500 femtoseconds) quenching of the excited states by energy                    transfer to the substrate.  The role of faster charge transfer                  processes (5 - 50 fs) will be investigated by measuring the cross-              sections, photofragment velocity and angular distributions, and                 polarization dependence for a series of small adsorbate molecules.                                                                                              Ultraviolet laser surface photochemistry is an important new area               of fundamental research which has potentially broad applications                in diverse technological fields such as semiconductor processing,               solar energy conversion, chemical catalysis, and eye surgery.                   However, little is known about the fundamental mechanisms                       underlying the photochemical reactions.  Both charge transfer and               electron attachment have been identified as important reaction                  channels.  Studies of the photofragmentation of adsorbed molecules              will provide a highly specific probe of the dynamics of energy and              charge transfer at interfaces.",
