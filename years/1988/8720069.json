 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is directed at understanding the mechanisms of                     postnatal development of neural processing of visual information                from the retina through the thalamus and the structural                         development of retinal ganglion cells.  The specific objectives                 are i) to evaluate the neurophysiological transfer function of                  visual signals from the retina to the dorsal lateral geniculate                 nucleus (LGNd) in kitten in vivo and, ii) to describe and model                 the rules that control retinal ganglion cell (RGC) shape,                       morphological class and spatial distribution in vitro.  In the                  first series of experiments, electrophysiological recordings of                 manifestation of the dominant RGC drive to an LGNd neuron (the S-               potential) will be extracellularly recorded concomitantly with                  the LGNd neurons' action potentials in response to visual                       stimulit which objectively evaluate the neuronal pairs' contrast                sensitivity function.  This experiment will directly evaluate the               hypothesis of increased functional convergence in the neonatal X-               cell pathway (and functioal degradation of spatial processing).                 In the second series of experiments, identified postnatal kitten                RGCs are grown in cell culture for several weeks.  Individual                   neurons and ensembles are monitored in real-time with                           digitization of time-lapsed images.  Development of cellular                    morphology and establishment of neuronal territories are analyzed               with the mathematical measure of fractal sets - the Hausdorff                   measure.",
