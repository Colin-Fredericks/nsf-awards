 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop an integrated, computer graphical                design tool for the numerical solution of boundary value problems               over domains containing geometric features with widely varying                  scales.  Many hours are presently spent in modeling such problems.              The proposed Structural Zooming System (SZS) will significantly                 reduce the cost and increase the accuracy of such analyses.                          The central concept, as introduced here, is simple, and is                 coined \"structural zooming.\"  This concept approaches the problem of            modeling a large complex object (the \"parent\" object) by recursively            analyzing smaller portions (\"child\" objects) of the parent.                     Geometrical and mesh refinements may be introduced for each                     successive analysis.  After analysis of the parent, a child is                  extracted.  Boundary conditions derived from the parent analysis are            applied to the child at the parent/child interface, and the child is            analyzed.  Overall accuracy is improved using an iterative algorithm            involving reanalysis of both the parent and child objects to reduce             disequilibrium at the interface (caused by \"back-coupling\" effects).            Finally, the method is recursive -- a grandchild, greatgrandchild               objects, etc., can be defined if responses on more refined                      geometrical scales are required.                                                     Phase I research will address the feasibility of structural                zooming.  A two-dimensional prototype, consisting of a number of                distinct software modules, will be developed.  Phase II will develop            a completely integrated Structural Zooming System for two- and                  three-dimensional objects, utilizing software designs and                       recommendations developed during Phase I.",
