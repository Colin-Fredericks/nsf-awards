 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant proposal enables four research groups of diverse                     research disciplines to study a selected group of enzymes of                    polyprenol biosynthesis.  The different groups will                             contribute skills in enzymology, microbial/genetics,                            synthetic organic chemistry, and physical organic chemistry.                    Most of the enzymes for study utilize allylic and homoallylic                   diphosphate esters as substrates.  They are isopentenyl                         diphosphate isomerase, two prenyltransferases (farnesyl and                     geransylgeranyl diphosphate synthetases), two enzymes that                      catalyze \"head-to-head\" condensation of allylic                                 pyrophosphates (squalene and phytoene synthetases), and                         finally, 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase.  These enzymes will be                      purified to homogeneity from Saccharomyes or Phycomyces.                        When necessary, genetic amplification of their expression                       will be used to obtain enough protein for study.  Photolabile                   substrate analogs will be prepared so that their catalytic                      sites can be identified and sequenced.  Hopefully, entire                       proteins will be sequenced so that a comparison of these                        enzymes that catalyze such chemically similar reactions can                     be compared.  In addition, comparative studies of the                           mechanism of the reactions will be undertaken.                                  %%%                                                                             Many biologically important polymers are made from a building                   block unit of five carbons.  These include natural rubber,                      the visual pigments, the colors and fragrances of flowers and                   fruits, light harvesting plant pigments, and pheromones and                     defensive substances.  Although the pathways of synthesis of                    these compounds are of crucial biological and economic                          significance, very few details of the enzymes carrying them                     out are known.  This project seeks to fill important                            information gaps and provide needed data on these important                     pathways.***//",
