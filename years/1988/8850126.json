 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide an exhilarating summer science experience for         30 American Indian students from the Four Corners region of the                 Southwest.  High school juniors, who rank in the upper thirty-three             percent of their class and have demonstrated science/math interest and          aptitude, will participate in a Young Scholars Program during the               summer of 1988 at Northern Arizona University.                                                                                                                  The project will cover several discipline areas including life,                 physical and earth science, math and computer sciences, speech                  pathology and engineering.  A variety of experiences will be offered            including hands-on laboratory experiments, extensive personal                   interactions with research scientists, science seminars, field trips            and, motivational and public speaking workshops.  Students will live            and eat on campus, matriculate with other students and attend classes           on career education, academic skills development and physical                   education.                                                                                                                                                      In the second year, ten of the thirty students will participate in an           extensive research experience with select faculty members.  These ten           would also serve as role models and \"big brothers\" and \"big sisters\" to         incoming new (30) participants.",
