 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Dr. Alan Picklesimer and Dr. Ruprecht                    Machleidt, Los Alamos National Laboratory, to collaborate with                  Dr. Rolf Brockmann, University of Mainz, Federal Republic of                    Germany.  They will study polarized nucleon electroproduction from              nuclei at energies and momentum transfers appropriate to the                    facilities at Mainz, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (The                 Bates Laboratory), and the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator                 Facility under construction at Newport News, Virginia.                                                                                                          A major goal of the program, of which this project is a part, is                the development of a consistent and complete framework for                      exploring nuclear structure by looking for relativistic effects and             subhadronic degrees of freedom using (e,e'p) reactions initiated by             polarized electrons in which the momentum and polarization of the               outgoing proton are measured.  The research will address a number               of issues, including the validity of current conservation in the                presence of a nucleon-nucleon interaction derived from meson                    exchange, the proper inclusion of relativistic wave functions with              non-negligible negative energy components, and the consideration of             many-body effects.  The second part of the program will investigate             possible modifications of the Coulomb sum rule, for which                       experimental evidence has prompted a number of explanations ranging             from relativistic effects to modifications of the size of the                   proton in a medium (i.e. the nucleus).  The collaboration will                  benefit from the expertise of the researchers on nucleon-nucleon                interactions, relativistic nuclear physics, and nuclear scattering              theory.  The researchers have successfully collaborated in the past             and this award will allow them to continue their productive work.",
