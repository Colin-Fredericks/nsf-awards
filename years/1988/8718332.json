 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                              Organometallic Chemistry Program. A long-range goal of the                      project is to unify the solid-state and solution chemistries of                 metal oxides, which have traditionally been treated as                          independent research areas. The project is concerned                            specifically with transferring chemistry usually associated                     with solid oxides to the solution state through the                             investigation of soluble polyoxoanions and organometal oxides,                  and transferring chemistry usually associated with inorganic                    complexes in solution to the solid state through the synthesis                  and study of solid oxide supported organic and organometallic                   complexes. In the first area, specific objectives include the                   selective oxidation of organic molecules in solution by                         polyoxoanions, the synthesis of polyoxoanion-supported metal                    clusters, the determination of surface protonation sites in                     complex isopolyoxoanions, and the photochemical oxidation of                    organic molecules by polyoxoanions. In the latter area,                         techniques developed for the synthesis of clathrasils and                       zeosils will be extended to the synthesis of crystalline                        silica-supported organic and organometallic complexes.                                                                                                          The results are expected to be useful in the design of better                   catalysts for oxidation of organic compounds and in the                         rational synthesis of oxidic materials with predetermined                       chemical and physical properties.",
