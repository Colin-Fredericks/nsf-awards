 "awd_abstract_narration": "The communication of earthquake hazard and risk information to                  increase public hazard awareness and preparedness and mitigation                activities is an integral part of the nation's effort to reduce                 earthquake losses.  A gap exists, unfortunately, between efforts to             inform the public about risk and knowledge based on scientific                  evidence about how this might most effectively be accomplished.                 Few empirical studies have ever been performed on the link between              risk education/communication to the public and public risk                      perception and/or behavior, and the conclusions which can be drawn              are, at best, unclear.  This research is a comprehensive study of               public response (perceptual and behavioral) to risk information in a            multi-county area in California in response to public education                 efforts and risk communications there concerning the Parkfield                  Earthquake Prediction.  Research will be performed in three study               communities.  Mail questionnaires will collect relevant data on 1200            households.  The impact of earthquake experience and distance to                risk will be assessed through the sampling design.  The effect of               risk communication factors on perceived risk and behavior will be               assessed through statistical analysis.  Hypotheses tested in this               research will be based on a synthesis of findings that stem from                public risk education research, warnings research and communications            research.  The Parkfield Earthquake Prediction Experiment has led               to risk communications to citizens in some six central California               counties.  It is the first scientifically credible prediction for a             quake in the U. S. with specified time, place, magnitude and                    probability that has been approved by national and state prediction             councils.  This provides an opportunity to study public risk                    communication/education effects comprehensively.",
