 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between                          Prof. Paul H. Cutler, Pennsylvania State University,                            University Park, and Drs. Pierre Sudraud and Ben                                Assayag of the Laboratoire de Microstructure et de                              Microelectronique - CNRS, Bagneux, France.  These                               researchers will study the application of low-energy                            focused ion and droplet beams to microelectronics and                           microfabrication.  While focused ion beams have been                            studied for direct exposure or mask-making for the                              fabrication of microelectronic devices at size ranges                           down to 0.1 micrometer, charged droplet beams have not                          been so studied.  These beams, which if produced by an                          electrohydrodynamic liquid metal source can be as                               small as 1 nanometer in diameter, may be useful for                             mask repair and microcircuit modification.  This                                study will address unanswered questions about droplet                           beam-surface interactions, beam stability, and effects                          of source parameters on beam performance.  Both                                 theoretical and experimental approaches will be used.                                                                                                           The French laboratory has excellent facilities for the                          experimental study of focused ion and droplet beams.                            These include an ingenious double scanning electron                             microscope and ion column synchronized for                                      simultaneous operation and, therefore, real-time study                          of the ion beam.  Theoretical expertise will be                                 brought to the project by the U.S. investigator.  The                           complementary expertise of the collaborators, as well                           as the sophisticated equipment available for the study                          in France, will assure a mutually productive effort.                            This work may have important implications for the                               fabrication and repair of microelectronic components                            and integrated circuits.",
