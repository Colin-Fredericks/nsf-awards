 "awd_abstract_narration": "In addition to revising the course content of introductory computer          science, this project revises the computer science laboratory                   experience so that it is highly structured.                                                                                                                        Unlike the laboratory component of physical and natural science              courses, computing labs tend to be informal. Students are given                 programming assignments which they complete on their own time.                  Frequently, laboratory sessions are not scheduled. This project                 introduces a highly structured lab into the introductory course where a         large screen projection system is used to give demonstrations and               preplanned lab activities are designed to clarify a concept,                    demonstrate and idea or teach a skill. The laboratory hardware consists         of Macintosh II computers that are networked, the software is the UNIX          operating system and Turbo Pascal.                                                                                                                                 This project also substantially revises the introductory computer            science course content in the courses for both non-majors and majors.           The course for non-majors, rather than being the typical                        \"appreciation\" course, is an integrated survey of the fundamental and           central principles of computer science. For example, students are               exposed to a Turing Machine simulator where they can observe and                experiment with this model. The course for majors is revised from being         only a programming course to one where students are exposed to a vast           collection of software development resources such as: syntax-directed           editors, hierarchical file systems, windowing systems, code profilers,          optimizers, assertion checkers, on-line documentation and help                  packages, and network mail.                                                                                                                                        This award is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.",
