 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to understand the molecular                   biology of epithelial morphogenesis in Drosophila imaginal discs                at metamorphosis.  Restructuring of imaginal discs into the adult               insect appendages requires extensive short distance                             rearrangements of cells within the continuous epithelium, a                     widespread morphogenetic mechanism.  In Drosophila these                        morphogenetic events are initiated by the steroid hormone 20-                   hydroxyecdysone and can be studied using in vitro culture of                    mass-isolated imaginal discs.  It has been possible to isolate                  and characterize hormone-responsive genes that are activated                    during morphogenesis.  This proposal will focus on a genetic and                molecular analysis of the regulation and function of one gene,                  IMP-E1 (Inducible Membrane Protein-Early,                                       transcriptionally active in the initial stages of imaginal disc                 morphogenesis.  Gene function will be investigated genetically                  by isolation and analysis of mutations that alter the                           effectiveness of the gene product.  A biochemical investigation                 of function will utilize immunological studies with an antisera                 produced against a fusion protein synthesized in a bacterial                    expression system.  The mechanism of steroid hormone regulation                 of expression of this gene will be determined and the fine-                     structure of the gene analyzed.  This proposal will further our                 understanding of the molecular biology of morphogenesis and the                 genetic mechanisms by which complex processes like morphogenesis                are controlled during development.                                              %%%                                                                                  Dr. Natzle proposes to investigate the properties of a gene                that may be essential for the normal formation of adult tissue                  during the development of an insect.  She has identified a gene                 that responds to a hormone that induces the formation of adult                  tissue.  By analyzing the regulation of this gene at a genetical                and biochemical level, Dr. Natzle will obtain basic information                 concerning the function of this gene in the process of normal                   morphogenesis.  An understanding of the molecular choreography of               morphogenesis may enable us to better analyze developmental                     abnormalities that occur when normal morphogenesis is perturbed                 or when cells within a tissue fail to retain their normal                       interactions with neighbors and substratum and produce invasive                 neoplasia.",
