 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physiology work stations which consist of modern data-taking               equipment and Macintosh computers (which are well-known for their               user-friendliness) are significantly improving the teaching of                  undergraduate students in this department.                                                                                                                           Microcomputers used as scientific instruments in undergraduate             teaching laboratories are perceived as being user-unfriendly by most            students.  This problem has been greatly reduced by the recent                  introduction of MACLAB by World Precision Instruments.  MACLAB converts         a Macintosh computer into a digital oscilloscope or chart recorder.             One of the work stations in this project has a Macintosh II computer            which functions not only as a digital recorder but also as a file               server to the other computers in the network.                                                                                                                        This allows physiology teachers to be innovative.  For example,            they are able to display previously recorded experiments in class.              Students can take physiology laboratory examinations (\"lab practicals\")         using MACLAB.  The high gain preamplifier (model 6132) manufactured by          Palmer Bioscience is a versatile instrument which functions as an               interface between a physiological transducer or a membrane potential            measuring circuit and the MACLAB.                                                                                                                                    The work stations are used by students enrolled in introductory            biology, animal physiology, neurobiology, and undergraduate research.           All major pieces of equipment are commercially available, thereby               facilitating the incorporation of similar work stations into biology            departments at other institutions.  The grantee institution is                  matching the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal              sources.",
