 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project proposes to work with 116 teachers, including 96 teachers           from six school districts in California and 2 each from ten other               states. Each of the 20 teachers outside of California will in turn work         with 100 other teachers in their states or districts. These are teachers        at the middle school level, grades 3-8. The first year of the proposed          three year project emphasizes the adaptation of curriculum materials            which were developed over the years by the proposed staff and their             colleagues. The goal of the first year of the project is to assess the          value of the materials to the participating teachers and their school           districts. The second year focuses on developing a program to train             trainers to use and adapt the materials in order to multiply the effect         of the program. The third year continues with the development of the            leadership activities and disseminates the course materials and                 instructional strategies beyond the targeted districts. There is an             active follow-up component in each of the years. There is to be eight           days of concentrated instruction during each academic year and twelve           days of instruction each summer.                                                                                                                                This proposal contains several excellent attributes. It is to be                conducted at an excellent academic institution; the PI, as the guiding          force behind the proposed activities, is a world renown scientist; the          proposed staff have formed a community of scholars and are totally              committed to the project goals; a very effective set of materials have          been developed and improved over the years; the staff has been most             successful in conducting workshops with the materials for teachers at           the middle school level and above; as an extension of past efforts the          team now intends to apply the materials and strategies at lower grade           levels. Considering the outside contributions, beyond what is requested         from the NSF, there is every indication that the project will receive           support and attention from the educational and scientific communities           and hence is worthy of funding as requested.",
