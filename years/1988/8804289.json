The Whittier Narrows earthquake caused extensive damage to water                distribution pipelines.  While theoretical modeling of earthquake               induced damage has been actively pursued, the theoretical models are            based upon damage mechanisms that are not well understood, and there is         very little data related to the direct observation of earthquake induced        damage.  Such data is needed to validate these models, so that they can         be used with confidence in deriving seismic design criteria.  At present        there is no code for buried pipelines.                                                                                                                          Thus, this project involves a thorough field investigation and analysis         of the damage to water lifeline systems around Whittier, California.  In        addition, the predictions of the existing models are being compared with        the observed behavior, and the models are being modified based on this          comparison and the understanding derived from the observations.                 Finally, effective recommendations are being derived from the models and        the observations for the design of new pipelines, and the retrofitting          of existing systems.",
