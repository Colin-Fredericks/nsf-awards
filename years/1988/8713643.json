The program has been successful in bringing highly expert, well-                established statisticians and social scientists on the faculties                of major universities to the Census Bureau, the nation's front-                 line data collection agency, where they engage in research aimed                at improving the adequacy of governmentally produced and                        disseminated socioeconomic information. Visiting fellows work                   with Census staff to tackle especially difficult problems in the                handling and analysis of data. The results of these efforts are                 cumulating into more efficient and effective agency procedures,                 more reliable and interpretable data products, and the                          introduction of more real-worldliness into the basic research and               teaching agenda of visiting scientists once they return to their                home institutions. A special arrangement allowing fellows to                    compete for continued support of research begun at the Bureau                   represents a further innovation created under this program. Among               other benefits, the freer flow of expertise and knowledge between               governmental data producers and academic researchers is breaking                down obstructions to the policy usefulness of quantitative data                 and, by increasing their scientific research potential, helping                 to amortize the huge annual investment this nation makes in their               collection.",
