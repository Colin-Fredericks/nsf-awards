 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reed College will establish a spectroscopy laboratory so that              undergraduate physics majors can employ the powerful techniques of              Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in laboratories at the senior,          junior, and sophomore levels.  The flexible, research level Bruker lFS          113V spectrometer will provide the equipment necessary for senior               physics majors to complete their required thesis in at least two fields         of solid state spectroscopy:  transmission measurements on nucleic              acids and reflection measurements on high temperature superconductors.          The instrument will also be used for experiments in the Advanced                Laboratory and for demonstrations and limited hands-on experience in            the sophomore laboratory.  The instrument will provide excellent                preparation of Reed physics majors for graduate work in experimental            physics.  In particular, the spectrometer will provide students with            the opportunity to undertake advanced experiments and research                  projects, leading to talks at professional meetings.  On a broader              scale, this project will establish a serious undergraduate experimental         physics program on the Reed campus.",
