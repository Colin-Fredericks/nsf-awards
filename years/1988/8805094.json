 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ultimate goal of this research is to visualize, in intact                   cells, the structure of any gene.  When gene expression is                      regulated at the level of transcription, changes in the                         structure of the gene are responsible for inducing changes in                   gene expression.  These functional differences in gene                          structure are initiated and maintained by the interaction of                    regulatory proteins and chromosomal proteins with the gene, and                 possibly, by the formation of altered structures within the DNA                 helix.  Dr. Becker is developing a set of photochemical                         methods, which, when taken together, is allowing one to detect                  as well as specify those elements of a gene's structure that                    are responsible for regulating its activity.  This approach is                  based on earlier work which demonstrated that ultraviolet light                 can detect, at single nucleotide resolution, protein DNA                        contacts in whole cells.  By directly probing gene structure in                 vivo rather than in vitro, potentially inaccurate or incomplete                 conclusions regarding the role of gene structure in regulating                  gene expression will be avoided.                                                                                                                                The ability to rapidly sequence any gene has revolutionized                     biology.  Here the next level of organization, the structure of                 the gene, is being attacked.  By determining the protein - DNA                  interactions and altered DNA structures within a gene general                   organizational principles for rendering the genetic message                     biologically active, stable, and inheritable will be uncovered.",
