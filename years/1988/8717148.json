 "awd_abstract_narration": "The molecular biology of coronavirus replication will be                        examinined using mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) as a model                         system.  It has been shown that MHV infection induces the                       synthesis of two separate RNA dependent RNA polymerase                          activities.  The proteins responsible for these activities                      will be identified by preparing specific antisera raised by                     immunization with either ppol-B-gel fusion proteins or                          synthetic peptides derived from both the 5' and 3' ends of                      the polymerase.  These antisera will be used to inhibit                         polymerase activity, identify the proteins, and in                              conjunction with cross-linking reagents determine the                           presence of the nonstructural proteins in the polymerase                        complex.  It has also been found that the nucleocapsid                          proteins binds specifically to genomic RNA and the subgenomic                   mRNAs.  The RNA sequence that initiate this interaction will                    be determined.  Finally, the maturational pathway of the                        virions will be studied by defining the interactions between                    the nucleocapsid and matrix protein.   Recent interest in                       this group of viruses is based on the fundings that they have                   very unusual molecular structures and an unique mode of                         replication.  They are a group of enveloped helical RNA                         viruses which have characteristic petal shaped clubs on their                   surface much like the influenza virus.  The genomic RNA of                      this virus is considerably larger than any stable RNA known                     to exist in nature.  The subgenomic mRNAs of coronaviruses                      are synthesized by a unique mechanism of discontinuous                          transcription, i.e. a leader RNA-primed transcription.",
