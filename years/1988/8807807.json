 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves a micro-empirical study of job changes and                unemployment and the effects of taxes on labor supply.  Existing                theories cannot adequately explain the operation of labor markets               over the business cycle, nor the impact of tax policy on aggregate              employment.  The first part of this study involves the development of a         detailed model of the labor market, based on empirical findings                 concerning the role of wage differentials.  This model will be used to          explain the changes in worker quit rates and job turnover rates over            the business cycle.  The second part of the study will analyze the              effects of the income tax on wages and unemployment.  A simple                  structural model of the U.S. economy will be constructed and used to            analyze the impact of tax changes.                                                                                                                              The analysis of tax changes is important because the macro economic             response to a tax increase may be a significant increase in                     unemployment, inflation, or both.   This analysis is particularly               timely because of the budget deficit reductions mandated by the                 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation which could result in significant tax         increases.  The work focusing on modeling the labor market should               provide important new insights into the dynamics of unemployment and            job turnover over the business cycle.",
