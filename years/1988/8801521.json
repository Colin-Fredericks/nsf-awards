 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although recent research has expanded knowledge of the myriad                   physiological roles played by crustacean hemocytes, synthesis of                this knowledge is impossible at present because of the lack of a                coherent, unified classification scheme for these cells.  Using                 the penaeid shrimp, Sicyonia ingentis, as a prototype for the                   decapod crustaceans, a hemocyte classification system was                       developed which relates cellular morphology and cytochemistry                   with three essential functions, clotting, phagocytosis, and                     encapsulation.  The overall goals of this research are to develop               a unified hemocyte classification system for the decapods to                    include taxonomically diverse species, taking into account                      possible variability in hemocyte morphology, cytochemistry, and                 function throughout the molt cycle, which is known to affect                    hemocyte abundance and function.  Two experiments are proposed                  for the coming year.  The first, using methods developed for the                shrimp, will explore the relationships between hemocyte                         morphology, cytochemistry, and the physiological functions of                   clotting, phagocytosis, and exoskeleton hardening, using a                      macruran, Panulirus interruptus, and a brachyuran, Loxorhynchus                 grandis.  The second experiment will determine whether there are                temporal changes related to molting state in the abundance,                     production, and activity of hemocytes.  Using the shrimp, changes               in total hemocyte abundance and differential proportions at                     various points during proecdysis, ecdysis, and post ecdysis will                be correlated with the proportions of hemocytes participating in                clotting, phagocytosis and hardening of the exoskeleton.                        Abundance of hemocytes comprising each category will be                         correlated with their production within the hematopoietic                       nodules.  This information should permit correlation of specific                features of decapod hemocytes with their ability to perform                     specific functions essential to survival of the organisms                       throughout the molt cycle.                                                                                                                                      The results of this research will broaden our understanding of                  the self recognition and self defense mechanisms of crabs and                   shrimp, and, since it will be pursued at an undergraduate                       institution, it will provide bright and motivated students with                 the opportunity to gain first hand experience with research.",
