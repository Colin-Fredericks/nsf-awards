 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  Support is provided for ten U.S. scientists to                    participate in a two-week Advanced Study Institute on Finite-Element            Analysis for Engineering Design to be held at the Indian Institute of           Technology(IIT), Madras, India.  The Indian organizer of the meeting is         Dr. C.S. Krishnamoorthy, of the Structural Engineering Laboratory at            IIT, Madras.  Other participants are expected from Europe and Asian             countries.  The objectives include exchanges of information on recent           work in several areas of finite element methods and its applications to         engineering design including three-dimensional stress analysis, plates          and shells, fracture mechanics, contact stress problems, heat transfer          problems, computer software and expert systems.  Future research needs          and developmental activities are to be identified.  The lectures are to         be published in a state-of-the-art book on the various topics.                                                                                                  Scope:  The meeting will bring top U.S. researchers in this field with          Indian, European and East Asian experts to exchange information.  The           U.S.-Indian interaction is likely to lead to future collaboration in            this important engineering field where Indian scientists have                   contributed significantly.",
