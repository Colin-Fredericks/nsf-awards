 "awd_abstract_narration": "The entomological collection of the Natural History Museum                 of Los Angeles County is amoung the largest in North America,                   containing over 4.5 million specimens.  Many singular                           collections, and its extensive use by scientists and technical                  investigators, make it important internationally, nationally, and               locally.                                                                             The collection is now properly housed in a compactor with                  space for some 15 years expansion.  Much of it remains in need of               preparation and curation in spite of great improvements by such                 treatment under a prior NSF facilities grant.  The needs                        addressed under the present award are the completion of further                 curatorial projects on material of prime significance to current                and anticipated research.                                                            The curators, aided by three full time technicians and                     visiting researchers, will mount, label, identify, sort, and                    organize specimens in three major areas:  (1) LEPIDOPTERA: mostly               neotropical moths, and special collections of North American                    material of historical, ecological, and taxonomic value.  (2)                   FORMICIDAE: George & Jeanette Wheeler lots of North Dakota and                  larval ants; Adis collection of Amazonian ants; ongoing                         accessions of Costa Rican ants; and miscellaneous voucher series.               (3) COCOS ISLAND INSECTS: virtually all material extant from                    this zoogeographically strategic island.  Visiting researchers                  will also assess other portions of the collection for future                    attention.",
