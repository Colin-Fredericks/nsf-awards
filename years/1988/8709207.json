 "awd_abstract_narration": "A substantisl body of data shows that identical (Monozygotic or                 MZ) twins maintain closer relationships with one another                        relative to fraternal (Dizygotic or DZ) twins.  The present                     research concerns the identification and examination of factors                 underlying social relationships within MZ and DZ twinships.                     It is particularly concerned with the further application and                   refinement of observational methods for capturing subtle                        aspects of cooperation and competition between twins and                        unrelated children; this interest extends earlier research on                   social interaction between young twins.  Some old questions,                    such as: are MZ twins more closely affiliated than DZ twins,                    and why? acquire new significance in light of social-genetic                    and kinship-genetic explanations of behavior.                                                                                                                   The present study will determine if twin group differences in                   cooperation and competition observed in childhood samples are                   also maintained in an adolescent twin sample.  This new                         approach encourages reevaluation of more traditional theories                   of twin dynamics, such as those offered by psychoanalytic                       theorists.  The implications of outcomes from studies of twins                  and non-twins, for social processes and activities within                       groups and populations, are related areas of interest.",
