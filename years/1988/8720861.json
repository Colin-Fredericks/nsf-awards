 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years research on enforcement and deterrence has                 turned from an almost exclusive focus on policing and the                       criminal justice system to a consideration of the enforcement                   practices in regulatory and administrative agencies.  As might be               expected, the thrust of this work is directed to understanding                  enforcement strategies, their variation, and the properties                     associated with different patterns of compliance.  In most of the               work to date, the level of enforcement effort has been treated as               a given, despite theoretical arguments that show the advantages                 of allowing enforcement intensity to vary in response to rates of               compliance and considerable casual observation suggesting that                  enforcement agencies do indeed tailor their actions in light of                 the behavior of the objects of the regulation.  This effort by                  Dr. Harrington and Kopp constitutes a significant step forward                  insofar as these investigators focus their energy on enforcement                as a dynamic and interactive process.                                                The goal of this project is to specify a simultaneous                      enforcement model, in which the probability of compliance, the                  inspection frequency, and the penalties assessed are determined                 endogenously, and apply it to examine the regulation of the                     nation's operating nuclear power plants by the Nuclear Regulatory               Commission (NRC).  The model will not only permit consideration                 of the relationship between enforcement and compliance, but also                the effects of other variables of interest on compliance,                       including technical variables such as plant size, utility-                      specific variables such as financial, health, or nuclear                        experience, and institutional variables.  The data will come from               NRC records on over 30,000 inspections that were conducted from                 1976 to 1986, supplemented by data on individual plants and their               situations including their record of civil penalties.                                Drs. Harrington and Kopp are testing their theory, developed               in previous research, that past compliance affects future                       enforcement more often than not and is an adaptive process.  This               is a departure from most enforcement work which continues to                    assume that enforcement variables are predetermined and invariant               over time.  The research offers the prospect of empirical                       examination of a more complex theoretical approach to enforcement               and compliance which will be an important scientific advance.  In               addition, the policy implications regarding safety issues at                    nuclear power plants will be useful as well since this project                  represents the first attempt to study the enforcement of NRC                    regulations statistically.",
