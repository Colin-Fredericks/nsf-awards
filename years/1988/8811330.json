 "awd_abstract_narration": "The spiraling cost of health care in the United States--due in                  large measure to the explosive growth of medical technology--is a               major national problem.  Yet many of these technologies have not                been properly evaluated.  They may in fact be ineffective or even               harmful, but once a technology has become part of accepted                      practice, the threat of malpractice suits alone tends to mandate                its continued use regardless of its actual efficacy.                                                                                                            With support from this grant, Dr. Mike is undertaking a case                    study which examines factors in the introduction and diffusion of               a perinatal technology, that of transcutaneous blood gas                        monitoring (TCM).  Her study will include:  a literature review                 concerning the development of scientific evidence in support of                 TCM; an examination of the available data to establish the                      pattern of diffusion of TCM; interviews with company managers,                  bioengineers, and others involved in R&D and marketing; and a                   review of the role of regulation and reimbursement.  In the                     course of this study, she will identify at each stage the ethical               and value dimensions of the process of development and diffusion                of this technology.  This study of factors outside of the health                care community is part of a larger project which will examine                   diffusion of perinatal technologies.  By obtaining clearer                      insights into the complex diffusion process of these expensive                  new medical technologies, this case study will aid public                       discussion and should ultimately contribute to more efficient                   health care planning for the nation.",
