 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to continue determination of factors           that influence the formation, growth and accumulation of algal biomass          on surfaces in contact with water flowing natural streams.  The                 effects of velocity, phosphorus, scouring and grazing on the                    accumulation of filamentous algae to nuisance levels will be studied            under varying conditions of nutrient enrichment.  This project is a             renewal of research conducted under NSF Grants No. 8304731 and 7918514          in which the effects of velocity variation and suspended solids                 concentration (both of which increase during storm runoff events) were          evaluated with respect to their relationship to critical levels of              phosphorus concentration on development of nuisance-level                       accumulations of algal biomass.                                                                                                                                 Effluents from domestic and industrial wastewater treatment plants              provide nutrient enrichment of surface waters in lakes and streams              which may result in nuisance-levels of filamentous algae.  In                   addition, urban stormwater runoff from urban and agricultural land              contributes to the nutrients available for stimulation of algal                 growth.  An improved understanding of the factors that lead to                  nuisance-level accumulations of algal biomass may lead to better                engineering design of treated wastewater outfalls and better                    management of drainage from urban and agricultural land to minimize             the pollutional impact of these nutrient sources on the                         quality of surface waters, especially flowing streams.",
