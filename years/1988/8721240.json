 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this conference series is to stimulate discussion                and research on the frontiers of the state-of-the-art of                        econometric and mathematical economic theory and methodology, and               the application of advanced mathematical, statistical and                       numerical analysis techniques in empirical economic studies.  The               conference is an attempt to hasten and improve knowledge and its                use, by shortening the time lags between the conception of ideas                and their dissemination and by inducing leading scholars to                     cooperatively apply their talents to selected, unresolved issues                which they feel are currently receiving inadequate attention.                                                                                                   The conference series has played an important role in providing                 informal channels of communication to specialists and young                     scholars in mathematical economics and econometrics.  The recent                record of successes point to its continuing vigor and ability to                accomplish its goals.",
