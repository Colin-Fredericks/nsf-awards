Specific course improvements being made include:  Introduction of               the atomic absorption method into introductory chemistry as a                   technique for the determination of the sodium content of over-                  the-counter medications and for the determination of the lead                   content of solutions of lead iodide; Demonstration of the                       principles of operation of an atomic absorption                                 spectrophotometer and its analytical applications in an                         instrumental analysis course; and Use of atomic absorption                      spectrophotometry in independednt study and in summer research                  programs.  The equipment is also being used in the annual summer                chemistry program for advanced high school students.
