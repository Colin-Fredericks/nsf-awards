 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program is the area of organometallic chemistry. The                  goal of the project is to develop more robust catalysts for                     conversion of alkanes to other organic compounds. Alkanes are                   the principal constituents of petroleum, and efficient                          catalysts for alkane conversion are therefore important in the                  industrial synthesis of plastics and other materials from                       petroleum. Replacement of these catalysts as they degrade is                    very expensive, and the development of catalysts which resist                   degradation is thus of great economic significance.                                                                                                             The focus of the project is the development of homogeneous                      alkane conversion catalysts which are not subject to                            deactivation by P-C bond cleavage. Particular emphasis will be                  placed on transition metal polyhydrides which are stabilized                    purely by N-donor ligands and which contain dihydrogen ligands.                 A variety of N- and S-donor ligands will be explored, and the                   structures of the polyhydride derivatives will be studied by a                  variety of physical methods, notably by Raman spectroscopy and                  variable temperature NMR spectroscopy. In addition to studying                  catalysts of new types, attempts will be made to extend the                     range of possible alkane conversions. Among the types of                        reactions to be explored are hydroalkylation of unsaturated                     species, alkylation of arenes and of CO, and dehydrocylisation.                 Such reactions are either not currently known at all for                        alkanes or are only known to occur over heterogeneous catalysts.",
