 "awd_abstract_narration": "Herbivorous insects use plant odors to find host plants.                   The mechanism by which they are able to track host odors to their               source when wind and turbulence cause odor plumes coming from                   plants to meander and break up is not known.  This dearth of                    information results in large part from the difficulty of                        describing and quantifying odor movement by capturing volatile                  compounds in the field.  A field and laboratory study is proposed               in which it will be determined whether chrysomelid beetles do not               use apparently suitable clumps of host plants nearby because they               are not findable or because quality (allelochemicals, nutrients)                causes them to be rejected if the beetles do find them.  This                   will be done by mapping the \"odor landscape\" to predict which                   plant clumps are findable or unfindable by colonizing beetles.                  Tracer volatiles and host-plant volatiles will be released and                  recaptured in the field using a cryogenic trapping technique.                   Laboratory choice tests and field experiments will be used to                   determine whether plant clones are acceptable to the beetles upon               discovery.  This research will contribute to the understanding of               how insect pests select their food plants and has potential                     application in pest control.//",
