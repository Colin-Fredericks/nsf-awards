 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is aimed at a fresh and novel approach to the problem of          production costing in power systems.  Central to current thinking               relative to production cost calculation is the concept of \"cummulants\"          or probability distribution first moment approximations.  These                 convolution calculations can be vexing since they are known to be very          useful when accurate and severely misleading in the decision process            when inaccurate.  A distribution of finite range can always be                  characterized by all of its moments.  Approximations require a few              moments but, how many is the question.  The standard approximation to           cummulants is the Gram-Charlier series with its Hermite polynomials.            There is preliminary evidence that this series is the root of the               problem and that orthogonal series such as Laguerre polynomial                  expansions offer solution.  The work will be performed in Sydney,               Australia at the University of New South Wales because, at the                  suggestion of the PI, work has already begun there.  I expect the               answer to be a result of this work with the expertise for future work           to reside at Ohio University.",
