This project will explore                the process and effect of religious change in the St. Lawrence                  Island Yupik community of Sivuqaq (Gambell, Alaska) and analyze                 the degree to which change from traditional religious practices                 to Protestant Christianity has been incorporated into Yupik                     Eskimo ethnic identity.                                                              This project addresses the nature of the conversion process                as well as the place of Christian religious practices in                        contemporary Sivuqaq identity.  Using a combination of                          ethnohistorical, ethnographic and textual analytical methods, the               student will look at the relationship between social practice,                  historical process and cultural mediation.                                           This project will contribute to the important current debate               on the role of Christianity and missionization in the                           incorporation of non-western peoples into the industrial world.                 In addition, it will have applied as well as theoretical                        implications.  As Eskimos try to cope with a changing world, it                 is crucial that we understand the processes that have affected                  them and influenced their sense of identity.",
