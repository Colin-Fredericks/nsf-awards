 "awd_abstract_narration": "The quantification of all aspects of the geosciences is                 creating a growing demand for accurate measurements of such                     quantities as physical properties, mechanical state parameters,                 and chemical compositions.  ODP holes are becoming increasingly                 recognized as important probes of environmental conditions as                   well as records of lithology.  Various techniques are available                 for measurements of the desired quantities in ODP holes, but most               of these have proved to be poor in sections of moderately                       consolidated sediments, which comprise an ever increasing                       percentage of footage drilled.  At the JOI/USSAC workshop on                    Physical Properties in ODP, this concern was addressed and a                    recommendation a made to develop the Navidrill/Geoprops concept.                In this concept, a 3 3/4\" hole is drilled 5 m ahead of the main                 bit with a mud-motor drive core bit and barrel. This Navidrill                  assembly can be withdrawn on a sand line and Geoprops probe, an                 internally recording system with packers and an array of sensors,               can be quickly placed in the small hole.  A conservative initial                design envisages measurements of temperature, pore pressure.                    permeability, stress orientation and pore fluid composition, but                other measurements could be added if the concept is successful.                 Before construction of the Geoprops probe, a feasibility study is               necessary to insure the need for and suitability of such an                     approach, to outline the scientific and engineering constraints,                and to develop a general layout.  This award will support such a                study.",
