 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a research conference on the critical but ill               understood process of how organizations learn and adapt and why some            organizations are gripped by inertial seemingly unable to learn and             change.  Insights into organizational learning will influence                   theoretical developments about organizations in several disciplines             concerned with the analysis of organizations.  It will also have                important implications for designing innovation and self renewal                processes in organizations (in particular where fast learning is                required for survival such as in the semi-conductor industry).  The             resulting volume of papers will be dedicated to honoring the                    contributions of James G. March to the field of organization theory and         organizational decision making.",
