 "awd_abstract_narration": "Regression analysis is a widely-used technique for measuring               relationships between two variables or among a number of variables.             This collaborative proposal will enable a spatial econometrician                (Anselin) and a spatial statistician (Griffith) to address several              methodological issues that arise when regression analysis is used to            analyze spatially-distributed phenomena.  Some of the assumptions               needed to validate regression analysis are not met when the technique           is applied to spatial data.  For example, adjacent spatial observations         are commonly not independent of each other.  How such violations of             validating assumptions affect the results of spatial regression are             largely unknown.  The applicants will devise measures and tests that            will enable scholars who wish to use regression analysis for spatial            data to determine how spatial phenomena affect regression analysis and          its results, and they will formulate procedures that can be used to             test and validate the results obtained from regression when spatial             data are involved.  Anselin and Griffith will disseminate the results           of their research by distributing software incorporating the methods            they develop and by conducting workshops to explain their results to            interested scientists.",
