 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in mathematics                   between Dr. Andrew Glass, Bowling Green State University and Dr.                J.S. Wilson, University of Cambridge, England.  Linearly ordered                groups are the building blocks for partially ordered groups, yet                very few examples or constructions are known.  Recently, Dr. Glass              and Dr. Wilson have shown that linearly ordered groups arise                    naturally in the investigation of certain doubly homogeneous groups             of automorphisms of linearly ordered sets.  This already answers                several questions concerning lattice-ordered groups and provides a              link between Hahn's Theorem for Abelian linearly ordered groups and             permutation groups.  Glass and Wilson plan to use this connection               as well as some recent constructions of infinite groups in the                  study of automorphism groups.                                                                                                                                   Wilson's research has been almost exclusively in constructions of               infinite soluble groups, whereas Glass's has been primarily in                  automorphism groups of linearly ordered sets and their                          applications.  Their areas of expertise are complementary and their             joint work could lead to considerable advances in this subject.",
