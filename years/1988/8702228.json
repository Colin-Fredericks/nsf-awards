 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prostaglandins and leukotrienes are two groups of compounds which are           important biological regulators.  They are synthesized from 20 carbon           fatty acids found in cell membranes of many organisms.  A great deal is         known about the structure and function of these compounds in mammals,           but the information is limited in non-mammalian vertebrates.                    In mammals, prostaglandins are involved in inflammatory responses,              cardivascular regulation, blood clotting, and reproductive physiology,          among other functions.  Leukotrienes are involved in allergic                   reactions.  Thus, regulation of the synthesis and actions of these              compounds is important to human medicine.                                                                                                                       It is important to examine poikilothermic animals such as amphibians            and fish, since they respond to changes in environmental temperature            with dramatic alterations in their physiological and biochemical                parameters.  The ratios of the 20 carbon fatty acid precursors change           in animals exposed to different environmental temperatures, and                 chemical reactions involved in synthesis may be faster or slower                depending on the temperature or the other membrane fatty acids which            are present.  This research will examine the synthesis of                       prostaglandins and leukotrienes and investigate their biological roles          in amphibians and fish.  Dr. Herman has discovered that leukotrienes            have different effects on the heart and on blood pressure of amphibians         than they do on blood pressure in mammals.  The reasons for the                 differences will be studied.  The possibility that these animals                produce novel compounds with different biological effects will be               investigated.  This information will provide a better understanding of          the synthesis and biological roles of these important regulator                 compounds",
