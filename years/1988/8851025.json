 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mentor scientists from industry and academia, secondary school science          teachers, and museum educators and exhibit designers will collaborate to        develop and implement a new student science research and public                 demonstration program.  In a two year pilot program 30 teachers and 60          students will be paired with the mentors, predominantly active private          sector researchers, to allow each student to develop and carry out a            research project.  Project topics will be chosen to relate to the               museum's unique regional emphasis on the Thames River Basin while               simultaneously matching student/teacher interests and mentor expertise.                                                                                         Each student will be involved for a two-year period.  During the first          year, she/he will focus on developing and completing the project, which         will be monitored by the teacher and guided by the mentor, who will             provide technical guidance and facility/equipment support.  In the              second year the student will work with museum staff preparing materials         and explaining/demonstrating her/his project for public and school              audiences.                                                                                                                                                      Project M. E. is designed as a demonstration of how a regional science          museum can bring together students, teachers, and the private sector to         enhance science education for students and promote public understanding         of science and technology.                                                                                                                                      Cost sharing by the partners will total 20% of the NSF funding.",
