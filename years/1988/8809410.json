 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop algorithms that will                   produce good solutions for dynamic routing and network-topology                 problems in the design of large communication networks.  The                    study of dynamic routing will use Segall's dynamic network model                and will emphasize aspects of dynamic routing that are not                      usually considered.  These aspects include a new \"worst-case\"                   cost functional, reducing the routing problem to a purely                       scheduling problem by restricting the topology of the network,                  and considering suboptimal routing algorithms that have low time-               complexities.                                                                     The principal investigator will analytically evaluate heuristic               design algorithms for the Capacitated Minimal Spanning Tree                     Problem as well as other local-access-network topology design                   problems.  He will focus on deriving probabilistic properties of                design algorithms, which should provide valuable insights into                  the design problems and conditions under which the design                       algorithms perform well.",
