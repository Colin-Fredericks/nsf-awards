 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Interactive Middle.Grades (IMS) Project will apply many of the              recommendations for change in science education to the critical middle          grades.  Florida State University at Tallahassee and Houghton Mifflin           Company will develop a science program for grades six through eight that        will meet the diverse needs of today's teachers and students.  IMS will         integrate teachers, textbook and laboratory with applications of the            microcomputer and the laser videodisc, producing a commercially                 marketable system for science instruction, classroom management and             student evaluation.  Science content, processes and skills focusing on          appropriate problems of science, technology and society will be integral        parts of the program.  This joint effort will involve professional              societies, distinguished science educators and will be consistent with          guidelines offered by the National Science Teachers Association and             National Association of Secondary School Principals.                                                                                                            Florida State University has built a reputation in curriculum                   development through the principal investigator in this project and other        well know staff members who will be available to assist in the                  development of the IMS program.  The partner in this project,                   Educational Software Division (ESD) of Houghton Mifflin Company, has            designed and marketed high quality computer software for the elementary         and secondary school market since 1966.  The publisher will invest in           excess of 14 million in this project during the 3 years development             phase and will contribute substantially to its continuance and teacher          training.                                                                                                                                                       The proposal addresses a clear need to improve middle school science and        promises to have an impact throughout the nation.  It is consistent with        the objectives of Instructional Materials Development Guidelines,               particulary the cooperation of major school systems, publishers and             universities to help in the process of dissemination and utilization.",
