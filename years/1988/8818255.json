 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a conference grant for the purpose of defraying the travel and          per diem expenses of invited speakers at the Symposium on Molecular             Electronics - Biosensors and Biocomputers.  This conference will be             held in conjunction with the 19th Annual Meeting of the Fine Particle           Society during July 19-22, 1988, at the Santa Clara Convention Center,          Santa Clara, California.  This Symposium is a major activity planned            for the Biotechnology, Health and Environment Division, which is one            of the six divisions in the Society.  It is designed to cover                   multidisciplinary aspects of materials sciences with a common bearing           on molecular electronics and biosensors.  The intended audience is              from equally multidisciplinary backgrounds but with a common interest           in biotechnology.  This meeting also serves as a forum for interaction          of leading scientists with diverse expertise.  Some of the invited              speakers have never presented their work to the same audience before,           and others, while not considering their work in the context of                  molecular electronics and biosensors, have nevertheless contributed             significantly in the past to basic research which is relevant to                molecular electronics and biosensors.  It is our hope that this                 meeting will serve as a stimulus to the audience which may become a             major human resource for future research and development of molecular           electronics devices and biosensors.  It is also our hope that the               meeting will foster an enhanced interaction among scientists from               diverse backgrounds.",
