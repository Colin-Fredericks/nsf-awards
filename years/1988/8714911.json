 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program                  supports research of Dr. John Eisch, State University of New                    York at Binghamton, which is aimed at elucidating the reaction                  mechanisms of chemical transformations of unsaturated                           hydrocarbons mediated by the synergistic action of main-group                   and transition metal organometallics.  Though this work focuses                 on identifying the step-by-step reaction sequences and their                    rates in such processes, the long-term goal of research in this                 area of chemical dynamics is to understand how chemical                         reactions can be directed to give maximum yields of useful                      products with a minimum expenditure of energy and resources.                                                                                                    Starting from an extensive physical-organic study of organo-                    aluminum reactions, this project will probe three fundamental                   and interrelated aspects of Ziegler-Natta-type metal-promoted                   catalysis:  (1) the kinetics and stereochemistry of the                         transition metal-catalyzed hydrometallation of olefins and                      acetylenes, a process fundamental to the synthesis of higher                    olefins from ethylene; (2) an analogous study of the                            carbometallation of such unsaturated hydrocarbons, a process                    central to the oligomerization and polymerization of olefin                     monomers; and (3) the metallation of organic substrates by                      transition or main-group catalysts.  This grant continues                       research previously supported by Foundation grant CHE-8308251.",
