 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Stanford University will allow the PI to analyze                  the interaction between reproductive behavior and family process                in Japan during the Tokugawa regime (1702-1872).  The data will                 be drawn from unusually complete household records for eight                    villages, covering some 10,000 persons, 4,200 births and 1,000                  conjugal units.  The general objectives of the project are to                   complete a full-scale multivariate analysis of family                           reproductive process (using log-linear contingency table models)                relying on historical ethnography and a reconstruction of                       environmental conditions both to inform the analytical design and               to help interpret the results.  Infanticide was practiced by                    households in these villages throughout the period of study.                    This research will test the hypothesis that in general                          infanticide was a form of family planning designed to serve the                 long run interests of the corporate stem family.                                                                                                                This research will contribute to demographic anthropology,                      historical anthropology and family-kinship studies.  It will                    provide important theoretical material about the status of women                in agrarian families and may help illuminate the passive                        infanticide found in the Third World today.",
