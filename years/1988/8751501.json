 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Kalamazoo Area Mathematics and Science Center, established in 1985          with a $2,000,000 gift from the Upjohn Company, provides facilities for         advanced mathematics and science activities and courses for high school         teachers and students from nine public and three non-public school              districts.  This project will develop and implement expanded programs           for utilizing technical professionals from area industries, hospitals,          and other non-educational organizations as well as from neighboring             higher education institutions to expand the programs of the Center, both        internally and through outreach to area schools.  These outside                 professional will be utilized in two capacities.  As resources persons,         they will work with teachers in enriching class curricula through               consulting, classroom presentations, and assisting in the development of        teaching materials.  As mentors, they will help individual students             devise and conduct research projects. Replicable procedures for                 recruiting, training, and utilizing such  resource persons and mentors          will be developed and disseminated widely for use in other communities.                                                                                         Cost sharing by the partners will total 100% of the NSF funding.",
