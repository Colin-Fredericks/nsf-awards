 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Black Sea is the only extant, relatively larger ocean               basin that contains a substantial volume of anaerobic deep water.               The sediments deposited in deeper water over perhaps the last 5-7               Ky are sapropelic to finely laminated and calcareous.  21 day leg               of the R/V Knorr in the Black Sea in 1988 will provide an                       examination of the geochemical record in sediments of the timing                of initiation and expansion of deep water anoia.  This will be                  accomplished by an integrated study of box cores and large                      diameter gravity cores from as many as 30 stations with extensive               coverage of the basin deeps.  Carefully collected and preserved                 cores will provide a varve-calibrated timescale for the late                    Holocene Black Sea sequence using various photographic methods,                 NMRI (nuclear magnetic resonance imaging), microdensitometry,                   radiocarbon dating.                                                                     The results will be synthesized, in cooperation with other              researchers, for interpretation of the imprint of anoxia on the                 sediment geochemical record and the changes in productivity and                 accumulation rates that accompanied climate and sea level                       changes;  statistical treatment of varve records will yield                     patterns of quasi-cyclic variations on timescales of 1-1000                     years.  All such inferences are important for interpretation of                 ancient laminated, organic-carbon rich strata.",
