 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program                  supports research on metal-catalyzed chemical reactions which                   involve transient intermediates known as carbenoids.  Prof.                     Doyle's work is aimed at developing new reagents and catalysts                  which can significantly enhance selectivity in such                             processes.Since carbenoids are a widely occurring family of                     reaction intermediates which can be used for constructing a                     variety of organic chemical types, most notably strained                        three-membered rings, this work has important applications to                   chemical synthesis.                                                                                                                                             In this project several approaches are taken to enhance                         selectivity in catalyzed carbenoid reactions, including                         synthesis of diazocarbonyl reagents with restricted access to                   the diazo functionality, the design of new and effective                        catalysts for selective carbenoid transformations, and                          substrate constructions that are formulated to provide control                  over competing reaction pathways.",
