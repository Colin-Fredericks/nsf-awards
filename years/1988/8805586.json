 "awd_abstract_narration": "Issues on performance and yield in defect- and fault-tolerant                   multiprocessors are being addressed in this research.  Two different            classes of multiprocessors are being considered in the research:                shared-memory multiprocessors and multicomputer systems with local              memory.  Issues relating to metrics for capturing the most important            properties of multiprocessors and algorithms for calculating the yield          and performance of multiprocessors are being studied.  The benefits and         drawbacks of increasing the level of integration in the design of               multiprocessors are being investigated.  This research will result in           an ability to determine the best level of integration for a given               defect- and fault-tolerant multiprocessors system.                              Improvements in technology have reduced the defect density as well as           the failure rates of all components in multiprocessing systems.                 However, the large increase in the number of components per system has          more than offset the increase in yield and reliability of a single              component.  It is desirable that a given system have graceful                   degradation in performance in the presence of faulty components.  The           proposed research addresses the important issues of estimating                  performance and yield of multiprocessors and the benefits and drawbacks         of increased level of integration.  Results obtained will allow the             design of more reliable and fault-tolerant multiprocessors.  Support is         strongly recommended.",
