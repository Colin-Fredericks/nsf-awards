 "awd_abstract_narration": "In attempts to understand evolution, the study of genetic               variation within and among species has been a major research                    focus.  In some species, genetic variability at biochemical loci                is so great the one must ask whether it exists as a result of                   natural selection or represents random \"genetic noise.\"  This                   research will examine this question by studying:  (1) the model                 organism, Fundulus heteroclitus, (2) representative enzyme                      systems, and (3) mitochondrial DNA patterns.  These studies                     include:  the mechanisms responsible for different enzyme                       concentrations among populations, the specific genetic changes                  responsible for known functional alterations in the enzyme                      lactate dehydrogenase, the study of functional differences in                   several other enzyme systems, metabolic studies to determine how                enzyme variation affects physiology, developmental rate studies                 to reveal how cellular differences manifest themselves as                       phenotypic characters, experiments that will assess the magnitude               of selection, and mtDNA pattern studies that will provide                       information on the previous genetic history and population                      dynamics of the model species.  The results of this                             multidisciplinary approach, which begins at the molecular level                 and progresses to the ecological level, will lead to a broader                  understanding of evolution and help answer the hotly debated                    question:  \"Does the majority of genetic variation at the                       molecular level provide the biochemical rootstock of evolutionary               change?\"",
