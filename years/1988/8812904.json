 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study addresses the problem of labor-market stratification,                examining the unequal distribution of earnings across occupations. The          goal is to document trends in wage inequality, and to examine possible          structural factors that might explain changes in the way wages are              distributed.  Despite the importance of this issue, much of                     contemporary scientific research focuses on individual abilities and            work experience to explain earnings differentials, neglecting the               effects of structural labor market characteristics.  In contrast, Dr.           Raffalovich plans to use pooled cross-sectional time-series data on             employment and earnings in the United States from 1967 through 1981 to          determine the impact of structural factors on wage inequality.                  Moreover, he also will examine how changes in the occupational and              industrial composition of the national labor force may foster shifts in         earnings inequality over time.  Using Current Population Survey data as         well as other government archival sources Dr. Raffalovich will document         trends in wage inequality over the 1967-1981 period, and evaluate the           effects of such factors as economic growth, industrial concentration,           unionization, unemployment and capital intensity.  For example, this            study will test whether an increase in capital intensity will shift             employment from high earnings to low earnings occupations.                                                                                                      This focus on change in wage inequalities as related to changes in              labor force composition is especially useful, given the recent shifts           that have occurred in occupations and industries, especially the growth         of the service sector of the U.S. economy and the substitution of               capital for labor.  By keying in on change, rather than wage inequality         at but one point in time, this study will contribute substantially to           our understanding of the dynamics of social stratification in the               contemporary United States.",
