 "awd_abstract_narration": "TASI-88 will be held during the four week period, June 5                   to July 1, 1988, at Brown University, Providence, R.I.  The                     format and aims of the proposed Tasi-88 are very similar to                     those of previous TASI's, held at the University of Michigan                    (1984), Yale (1985), the University of California at Santa Cruz                 (1986) and the St. John's College Campus, Santa Fe, New Mexico                  (1987).  The objective is to provide a series of lectures and                   seminars aimed at advanced graduate students.  The central                      theme of Brown Tasi-88 will be \"Particles, Strings and                          Supernovae\", with primary focus on four components:  (1)                        Standard model physics, extensions beyond the standard model,                   supersymmetry, GUTS, etc.; (2) nonperturbative aspects of                       quantum field theories, lattice gauge theories, connection to                   critical phenomena, etc.; (3) string and superstring, conformal                 field theories, Sigma-model, quantum field theory on Riemann                    surfaces; (4) cosmology and neutrino-astrophysics, formation of                 large scale structure, dark matter and its detection,                           supernovae, etc.  Seminars on a variety of special topics will                  supplement the main lecture series.                                                  This summer institute will help ensure that selected U.S.                  graduate students have the opportunity to learn first hand,                     from experts, of the latest developments in the areas covered.",
