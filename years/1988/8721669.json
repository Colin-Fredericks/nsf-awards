 "awd_abstract_narration": "The atmosphere above about 100km altitude, in increasing                   proportions with altitude, consists of electrically charged                     molecules and atoms that result from the absorption of solar                    ultraviolet and X-ray radiation.  This mixture of charged and                   neutral atoms and molecules is called a plasma, and the study of                irregularities that form in it under the influence of electric                  and magnetic fields and currents, is important because of its                   many applications.  Not only can we expect to understand and                    better predict the effects of plasma instabilities on radio                     communications and ground-satellite transmissions through this                  region, but it may have application to laboratory studies and in                areas such as magnetically confined fusion reactors.  The                       immediate objectives concern understanding large scale waves in                 the E region of the ionosphere, the heating caused by waves                     driven by auroral electric fields, and the dynamics of water                    cluster ions in the polar mesosphere (50-85km altitude) in the                  very cold conditions which exist there in summer.",
