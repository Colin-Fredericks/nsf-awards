 "awd_abstract_narration": "The relationship between herbivores and goldenrod (Solidago             altissima) will be studied at several sites in the environs of                  Ithaca, New York, with the purpose of explaining how plant-                     herbivore interactions vary during different stages of succession               and on sites of varying fertility.                                                      The research will be organized around three activities.  One            activity involves the completion of a long-term study (6 years)                 in old fields to determine how prolonged suppression of                         herbivores has altered: 1) the relative importance of different                 plant species; and 2) the standing crop biomass of the vegetation               in the system.  A second activity will involve the determination                of the major population levels of goldenrod-herbivores in 6                     meadows.  The meadows are in different successional stages and so               the food resources available to the herbivores differ.  And the                 third activity will involve a comparison of adaptive syndromes of               caterpillars in forests and meadows.  This will permit Dr. Root                 and his colleagues to determine if there are basic differences in               the population biology of species that utilize similar resources                in different habitats.                                                                  This research will expand our understanding of plant-                   herbivore interactions and should help us to develop biologically               sound practices for herbivore control.                                                  Dr. Root has an excellent record of scientific achievement.             Previous NSF grants to him have produced a large number of peer-                reviewed scientific papers and have supported the training of                   numerous young ecologists.  Cornell University will provide                     excellent institutional support for this research.  The Ecosystem               Studies Program recommends award of this grant.",
