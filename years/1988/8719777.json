 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the summer of 1984 a thunderstorm experiment was                    conducted near Langmuir Laboratory, New Mexico Institute of                     Mines and Technology in central New Mexico.  One primary                        objective of this field experiment was to understand                            thunderstorm electrification.  Presently the cloud charging                     mechanisms and the relative importance of different currents in                 reducing the electrical energy of thunderstorms are not well                    understood.  Professor Marshall made electric charge                            measurements by releasing instrumented balloons through the                     thunderclouds.  Preliminary work indicates that falling                         precipitation creates a substantial electric current inside the                 sampled thunderclouds.  Under this grant Professor Marshall will                continue analyzing the electric field soundings collected during                the New Mexico experiment.  His results, together with Doppler                  radar analyses of the thunderstorms carried out by other                        participating scientists, should improve our understanding of                   thunderstorm electrification.",
