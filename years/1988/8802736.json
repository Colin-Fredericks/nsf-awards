 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation is a study game-like models of computation and their         applications in Computer Science.  A theory of two-person computational         games has already ben developed and has applications in optimization,           cryptography, number theory and many other areas.  This effort will             continue research on two-person games, by generalizing known results            and extending the standard models to include new classes of game-like           problems.                                                                                                                                                       This project will also result in a characterization of the complexity           of some multi-person games that model problems in distributed                   computation and cryptography.  To complement this research the uses of          game theory in the design of distributed algorithms will be                     investigated.  The benefit of this research will be a better                    understanding of the complexity of game-like computational problems, in         particular, problems in distributed computation.",
