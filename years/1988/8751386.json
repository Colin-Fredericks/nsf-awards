 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Texas Learning Technology Group (TLTG) is attempting to develop,            pilot and implement a physical science curriculum, entitled the                 Interactive Videodisc Physical Science Project.  The outcome of this            project, which incorporates the latest developments in the use of               advanced technology, will be a comprehensive 160-hour, two-semester             science curriculum, applicable to schools nationwide.  The                      course will be targeted primarily for use with middle school students in        the eight and ninth grades where physical science is traditionally              taught.  However it will be equally appropriate at the tenth grade              level.  The objective of this effort is to develop a comprehensive              physical science curriculum, which has a technology-based delivery              system using integrated computer, video, and audio components, and              improves learning by increasing the students's in-depth understanding of        physical science concepts and skills, by increasing student interest in         science, and by improving the ability of teachers to teach science.  The        TLTG effort is the first national project to develop a complete                 curriculum (including courseware, teacher resource guides, student              manual, classroom management system, and testing system)                        delivered primarily via interactive videodisc.  By utilizing interactive        videodisc technology in a comprehensive manner not previously explored          to this extent, this project integrates a myriad of sound instructional,        technological approaches with proven effective traditional modes of             instruction.                                                                                                                                                    This project has attracted a significant amount of contributions from           private sources both in terms of cash and equipment.  It appears that           the private sector is becoming more and more aware of the need both to          improve science instructional and to use new technologies to better             realize the improvements.  If the project continues to be as effective          as the prototypes suggest, it will stand as a high quality model for            adaptation by schools across the country.",
