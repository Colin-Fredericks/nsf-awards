 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tropical cyclones, with their conspicuous signatures on                    weather satellite images, pose a tremendous threat to human life                and properties when they make landfalls.  Our understanding of                  their genesis and evolution, however, is limited.  One                          contributing factor to this limited understanding is the oceanic                location of the tropical cyclones where routine meteorological                  observations are few.  Through Professor Gray's conscientious                   effort, he has a unique collection of rawindsonde and aircraft                  reconnaissance data of the tropical cyclones in all ocean                       basins, spanning the last decade or two.  Theoretical work and                  numerical simulations of tropical cyclones promote progress only                after they meet observational evidence.  Under this grant,                      Professor Gray will continue his observational studies of the                   formation, structure, change in intensity, and the tracks of                    tropical cyclones.                                                                   Professor Gray is respected internationally for his                        contribution to the study of tropical cyclones.  He is certainly                well qualified to pursue the work.",
