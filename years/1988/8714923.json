 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this exploratory project, mathematical models of chemical vapor              transport and deposition from the photodissociation of organometallic           compounds are developed; they are applied to a set of experiments so            as to yield the intrinsic rate parameters for both gas phase and                surface reactions.  With these rate parameters, a numerical model of a          deposition reactor with significant interfacial convective effects is           carried out, and the predictions of film growth rate and spatial                uniformity will be compared to data.  In a companion program,                   photodissociation of a model organometallic compound is studied                 experimentally over a range of pressure and compositions.                       Experimental conditions range from those under which kinetic phenomena          control, to conditions at the opposite extreme, where reaction and              deposition occur in a flowing system at sufficiently high pressure              that diffusive and convective effects dominate the observed deposition          rate of the metal film on a surface.  This unique joint program will            produce an experimental protocol for obtaining kinetic data and                 mathematical procedures for interpreting the data so as to produce              intrinsic kinetic parameters free of artifacts due to gas phase and             interfacial transport resistances.                                                                                                                              Studies of the kinetics of thin film growth are often carried out               under conditions such that the intrinsic kinetics are hidden by                 resistances to gas phase and interface transport.  This study is                designed to permit accounting for these transport effects so as to              produce fundamental kinetic data.  Further, a model organometallic              compound is selected in this initial study so as to eliminate                   uncertainties that arise from the complexity of the reaction                    mechanism.",
