 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electro-Optics is one of the fastest growing high technology               disciplines in the world.  As of 1987 the dollar value of optics                instrumentation produced by U.S. industry was in excess of $10                  billion.  At present, however, the full potential of this                       discipline is threatened by the lack of fundamental research and                by a serious manpower shortage to accomplish this research.                     Industry has indicated an interest in supporting a cooperative                  research center in electro-optics technology.  The objective of                 such a center would be to address the generic research needs of                 industry, especially in optical materials, applied image                        processing, and non-linear optics.  An I/UCRC in Electro-Optics                 Technology appears to be one approach to satisfy the noted need.                Alternative organizations, operations, and policies would be                    studied as well as industry's interests and specific needs in                   research.                                                                            The principal investigator is highly qualified to direct a                 study of the viability and feasibility of an Industry/University                Cooperative Research Center in Electro-Optics Technology.  The                  study would also determine if the Center has the potential to                   become self-sufficient with industrial funding in a five year                   period as NSF funding is phased out.  The Program Manager                       recommends that Tufts University be awarded $25,000 for one year                to fund such a study.  All future funding will be on the basis of               a new proposal.",
