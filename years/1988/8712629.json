 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knowledge of the physical and chemical changes occuring in                      the bulk lubricant and the solid-lubricant interface is                         essential in order to control friction and wear.  This                          program will employ spectroscopic techniques to study these                     physical and chemical chances under realistic conditions.                       Laser light scattering and vibrational spectroscopy will be                     used to investigate the micellization and oxidation                             phenomena in bulk oil,as a function of temperature, wear and                    anti-oxidation additives and oxygen pressure.  The changes                      occurring at the interface will be followed both under                          static and dynamic conditions.  Under static conditions                         attenuated total internal reflection IR spectroscopy will be                    used to monitor the adsorption-desorption, and reaction                         kinetics of the oil and the additives at the solid-lubricant                    interface.  Analysis of the data will yield rate constants                      as well as chemical information about the alignment and                         binding of the lubricant molecules to the solid surface. The                    oxidation kinetics of the solid surface will be determined                      from an analysis of the vibrational bands due to the                            formation of metal oxides.  Perhaps the most informative                        measurements will be obtained under realistic conditions                        with a diamond slider.  Using single reflection FTIR and                        Raman scattering the chemical condition of                                      the lubricant film and the solid surface will be measured in real               time right behind the contact point as a function of load and                   temperature.",
