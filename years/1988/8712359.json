 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a one-year cooperative research project between         Professor Peter A. Rogerson, Department of Geography, State University          of New York at Buffalo, and Mag. Gunther Maier, Institute for Urban and         Regional Studies, University of Economics, Vienna, Austria.  The                primary goal of this research is to develop and evaluate methods for            making practical applications of various mathematical models that have          been constructed in the field of optimal search theory.  In this study,         particular emphasis will be given to search processes that have a               spatial aspect, that is, where variables such as location and distance          are important in the search decisions, as they would likely be, for             example, to an individual searching for housing or employment.  The             cooperating scientists expect to contribute to the theory of spatial            search processes and to investigate the possibilities and potentials            for empirical estimation and application of these processes.  They will         study the relationship between optimal search models and so-called              discrete choice models.                                                                                                                                         Spatial search is central to a broad body of geographic theory.  The            work to be carried out here has potential application in modeling such          areas as consumer behavior, journey-to-work decisions, recreational             preferences, housing-market searches, and labor migration, among                others.  Complementary skills, knowledge, and experiences of the two            investigators will be combined in the project.  Professor Rogerson's            background includes geography and mathematics, and he has particular            expertise in the area of optimal search processes.  His Austrian                colleague has a background in economics and is especially knowledgeable         about the discrete choice model, which is relevant to the spatial               search processes being studied here.  Previous collaboration between            the scientists has been productive, and this current study will broaden         and extend their past efforts.",
