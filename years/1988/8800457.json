 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action is for continued support of a U.S.-Taiwan                           cooperative research project (NSF CES-8417856) to record and                    disseminate earthquake strong ground-motion data.  This                         research facility, called SMART-1 (Strong Motion ARray in                       Taiwan -1), is a large-scale digital strong-motion array                        installed in a highly seismic area of Taiwan.  It is a                          collaborative project between the University of California at                   Berkeley and the Academia Sinica of the Institute of Earth                      Sciences at the National Taiwan University.                                                                                                                     The SMART-1 array commenced operation in September 1980,                        and in the first 6 1/2 years of operation, strong-motion records                from over 50 local earthquakes of magnitude between 3.8 and                     7.0 (Richter scale) have been recorded.  These strong-motion                    records represent an important resource for earthquake                          engineering and for the understanding of seismic strong motion                  in the near field.                                                                                                                                              The goals for this continued cooperation are: (1) To support                    research on the strong-motion data sets already recorded,                       including the magnitude 7.8 earthquake on November 15, 1986,                    and (2) to                                                                      assist in the relocation of a major part of the array to a new site             in the same highly seismic region, with firmer (stiffer) ground                 foundation conditions. This will provide earthquake response data for           structures built on stiff soil and rock sites.",
