 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program                  will support a series of three annual \"Workshops on Organic                     Synthesis and Natural Products Chemistry.\"  These workshops                     have the dual purposes of (1) providing an effective forum for                  informal discussion among young scientists of current research                  in topical areas of organic synthesis and natural products, and                 (2) assisting the Program staff in identifying areas and the                    researchers which will aid in the Program's long-range planning.                                                                                                The specific goals of this workshop include:                                                                                                                    1.  The dynamic exchange of ideas in organic synthesis and                      natural products chemistry among a small group (about 20) of                    active young research workers in these fields.                                                                                                                  2.  Encouragement of an attitude of cooperation among                           individuals working in related areas, and, by the same token,                   avoidance of duplicative efforts.                                                                                                                               3.  Stimulation of participants to study new problems and                       methods in synthetic and natural products chemistry.                                                                                                            4.  Creation of an atmosphere in which the scientific and                       social interaction among participants will be both fruitful and                 pleasant.",
