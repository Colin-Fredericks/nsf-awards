 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this Young Scholars project are to recruit, prepare           and motivate minority high school juniors and seniors, including women          and the disabled, for college education leading to advanced degrees             and/or professional careers in science, agriculture, and engineering.           Summer activities over an 8-week period will include:  (1) A 3-day              orientation with a roundtable discussion on career opportunities,               involving the students, the project staff and representatives from              academic, public and private institutions involved in research and/or           development in chemistry, physics, engineering, agriculture and other           science-related areas; (2) Pre-college classes and laboratories                 involving all participants and designed to enhance their interest in            and knowledge of pre-calculus, chemistry, physics, elementary                   statistics and computer use;  (3) Research and/or scientific exercises          in the areas of agricultural engineering, plant and soil sciences,              agricultural economics and rural sociology, and animal science; and (4)         field trips focused primarily on academic, public and private                   institutions involved in research and/or development.  Each student             will also be introduced to the philosophy of science with special               emphasis on role of science, research methodology and integrity in              scientific research.  These activities will be individually executed            under the supervision of an advisor.  Seminars are scheduled to promote         interaction among the participants.",
