 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year U.S.-China cooperative research project on excimer                laser studies between Frank Tittel and Roland Sauerbrey of Rice                 University and Zuguang Ma of the Harbin Institute of Technology                 addresses two basic and challenging problems in the field of visible            laser systems and novel and promising ultraviolet lasers:  (1) the              investigators will evaluate and implement techniques leading to a               more efficient, direct electrical excitation of broad band excimer              lasers; and (2) establish experimental and theoretical criteria                 needed to assess the feasibility of novel, short wavelength lasers              (the VUV and XUV region of the electromagnetic field).  This                    research will yield new, fundamental knowledge on lasers and                    improved laser devices that have important applications in                      electronic materials processing, remote sensing and biomedical                  research.                                                                                                                                                       The Rice University and Harbin Institute of Technology                          collaboration is based on complimentary research strengths and                  resources.  Both groups have considerable expertise in laser                    spectroscopy.  The Rice group is particularly expert in kinetics of             excimer laser media; whereas, the Harbin group has considerable                 experience in discharge laser physics.  Linkage of the Rice and                 Harbin facilities and expertise promotes the major purpose of a                 U.S.-China Cooperative Science Program; which is, to advance                    scientific knowledge through combined scientific efforts and                    abilities of American and Chinese scientists and engineers.",
