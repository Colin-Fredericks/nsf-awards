 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies specific for surface                       determinants of three protein complexes isolated from spinach                   thylakoid membranes will be isolated by affinity adsorption                     to rightsideout or insideout thylakoid membranes.  These side-                  specific antibodies will be used to identify those proteins                     which display antigenic determinants to the aqueous milieu in                   which the thylakoids are suspended.  Comparison of those                        proteins with stromal exposures with those proteins                             displaying lumen exposures will indicate which proteins are                     transmembranous.  In other experiments, monoclonal antibodies                   will be used to demonstrate which proteins lie beneath the                      four lumen side extrinsic proteins which are involved with                      water oxidation.  Together, these experiments will greatly                      enhance our understanding of the topology of the selected                       protein complexes, thus allowing the development of                             increasingly sophisticated structure/function models of the                     process of photosynthetic energy conservation.                                  %%%                                                                             The overall objective of these experiments is to increase our                   understanding of the transverse orientations and topologies                     of three protein complexes required for photosynthetic energy                   coupling.  The proposed research will enhance the development                   of more sophisticated and topologically correct models of                                                                                                       these protein complexes and lead to a better understanding of                                                                                                   photosynthesis.",
