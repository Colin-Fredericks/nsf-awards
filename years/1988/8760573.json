 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this program is to support the                    modernization of the precision casting industries in the United                 States by providing knowledge integrated Computer Aided Engineering             and Manufacturing tools and methodologies for significantly reducing            the cycle-time for mold and process design and for reducing the rate            of rejection of finished cast products.                                              The approach is to make use of Knowledge-Base Integration and              Parallel Computation techniques, which have been developed by UES               during the last three years, for (1) integrating existing data bases            and knowledge with CAD/CAM/CAE (computer-aided design, computer-                aided manufacturing, and computer-aided engineering) tools to guide             the designer in determining key process and design parameters; (2)              speed up process modeling techniques used for optimizing the design             procedure.                                                                           The proposed system will be practical, cost effective and                  profitable in the vendor industrial environment.  During Phase I a              feasibility study will be conducted to identify the implementation              strategy and in Phase II a prototype product will be developed and              the approach will be validated.  The prototype product will be                  productized and implemented in four or five major foundries in the              United States. To achieve the goals of Phase III, a consortium of               foundries will be formed.",
