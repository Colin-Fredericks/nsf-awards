 "awd_abstract_narration": "A larger proportion than ever before of American women (including               minority women and disabled women) will have to become available                to join the S/E workforce during the next two decades, if only to               help stem the decline in the total S/E workforce now expected on                the basis of demographic data.  An important transition phase in                the careers of future women scientists/engineers is the immediate               postdoctoral period, during which a serious differential in                     participation in S/E occurs.  Previous attempts to understand                   such attritions have been only partly successful.  We therefore                 shall undertake a major effort (building on our experience with a               pilot project) to study the whole population of women scientists/               engineers, as well as matched samples of men as control, all of                 whom in the past received Postdoctoral Fellowships from NSF and                 NRC.  Quantitative and qualitative data, obtained through                       standard survey and analysis methods, will be used to provide a                 fuller description of the existing barriers, and to formulate and               test propositions that can help guide policy for their                          amelioration or removal.",
