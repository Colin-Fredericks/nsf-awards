 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is providing instruments that improve five areas of a         cell biology laboratory.  An incubator and muffle furnace aid efforts           to determine composition of cells.  A photomicrographic microscope with         capability to detect fluorescence is used to locate specific antigens           by using FITC-antibodies.  A cryostat is used to section fresh tissue           that, selectively stained, is used to identify the cellular locations           of specific molecules.  Oxygen probes with accessories are used to              follow electron flow rates in mitochondria and chloroplasts.  A                 recording UV-VIS spectrophotometer enables undergraduates to do                 absorption spectra and to analyze enzyme reactions.  Finally,                   electrophoresis chambers and a densitometer are used in the analysis of         isozymes and the characterization of DNA.                                                                                                                            The objective is to raise the level of involvement of sophomore            biology students in investigations of cell function.  Early                     involvement of students in cell biology experiments is expected to              result in higher scores on senior exams in the cell biology/molecular           section of the Graduate Record Examination.                                                                                                                          The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
