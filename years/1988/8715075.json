 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Prof.                    Herbert Carlin of Cornell University and Prof. Pier P. Civalleri                of the Istituto Politecnico di Torino in Turin, Italy.  The                     design of broad band analog circuits, particularly at                           frequencies in the microwave spectrum and higher, has become                    increasingly important in recent years.  The application to very                broad band microwave field effect transistor (FET) amplifiers is                of great current interest.  The theoretical basis for such                      applications is gain-bandwidth theory or, equivalently, broad                   band matching theory.  Previous work by the U.S. P.I. and others                has led to the development of a new bandwidth theory, called the                real frequency method, as an alternative to analytic                            gain-bandwidth theory.  The latter, dependent on analytical                     specifity of the appropriate function of the complex frequency                  variable, has several drawbacks that make it numerically                        intractable for loads of modest complexity.  By contrast, the                   real frequency method handles loads of arbitrary complexity and                 directly utilizes real frequency numerical data.  The                           investigators plan to extend the real frequency method they have                developed for single input-single output systems with complex                   terminations, to the n-port equalizer problem.  They also plan                  to specifically concentrate on viewing a multi-element                          distributed amplifier as a multichannel problem so as to develop                simple parameter structures with optimum flat gain response.                                                                                                    The investigators bring to the collaboration past successful                    experience in working jointly on research problems in this                      area.  Wide band multichannel equalizers find important                         applications to systems in which multiplicity of complex loads                  must be simultaneously matched to one or more sources.  Examples                are generalized frequency crossover networks, multiplexing                      applications, and broad band amplifiers using many active                       elements.",
