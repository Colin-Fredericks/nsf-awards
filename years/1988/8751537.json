 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mechanical Universe and Beyond the Mechanical Universe is a                 one-year college level physics course for national television                   that was developed at Caltech and supported by a $5.8 M grant                   from the Annenberg/CPB Project.  For the past three years, the                  project staff which developed the undergraduate course, have been               adapting the videos for use at the high school level as well as                 providing written materials and teacher guides.  To date, 12                    modules have been adapted from The Mechanical Universe.                                                                                                         This project will select the most appropriate materials from                    Beyond the Mechanical Universe and adapt four modules for use at                the high school level.  In essence, the majority of concepts and                topics treated at the secondary level will be covered.  The four                modules will be selected from the following programs: \"The                      Lorentz Transformation\", \"Velocity and Time\", \"Optics\", \"The                    Atom\", \"Particles and Waves\", \"Atoms to Quarks\", and \"The Quantum               Mechanical Universe\".                                                                                                                                           The final selection of topics will be done by the project staff                 in conjunction with the Council on Development.  The Council is                 composed of 12 outstanding high school teachers who will work                   during the summer of 1988 and field test the materials in their                 home schools during the 1988-1989 academic year.  In addition to                the Council, approximately 60 other teachers across the country                 are participating in the field testing and evaluation of the                    program.                                                                                                                                                        This project is making a substantial contribution toward                        excellence in physics instruction.  Each module stresses                        conceptual understanding of the underlying physical principles.                 The computer animation adds to the learning experience in way not               possible in the past.  The current materials have been well                     accepted by schools across the nation and evaluation reports                    underscore their effectiveness.",
