 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide continuing support to the University of                 Minnesota for the summer program of undergraduate research                      experiences in the behavioral sciences established in 1987.  The                ten-week program will emphasize student participation in the                    research activities of faculty affiliated with the Center for                   Research in Learning, Perception, and Cognition in the College of               Liberal Arts.  Eight undergraduates will participate, half from                 private liberal arts colleges in the state of Minnesota and half                from the University; they will be expected to have completed                    their sophomore or junior years.  Students will: (1) assist with                a faculty member's research including opportunities to work as a                member of a research team, (2) complete an independent research                 project, the final products of which will be a written report and               a presentation to peers and participating faculty, and (3)                      participate in a multidisciplinary seminar.  Seminar activities                 include presentations by program faculty and faculty in related                 areas campus wide, laboratory tours, and lectures on research                   tools and design.  The program will therefore include                           opportunities for the students to learn specific research                       methods, to apply these methods in the context of their own                     research, and to examine broad conceptual and methodological                    issues relating to psychology and the cognitive sciences.                       Participation in social/cultural events as well as common housing               in a University dorm will help foster a strong community of                     students.",
