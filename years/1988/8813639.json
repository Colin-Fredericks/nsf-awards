 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent breakthroughs in signal processing based on higher-order or              polyspectra have been initially applied to deconvolution, array                 processing, signal detection, and identification of nonlinear,                  nonminimum phase systems.  Previously, conventional signal processing           techniques only permitted the recovery of minimum phase system                  descriptions, which were often not accurate.                                                                                                                    This one-of-a-kind workshop was organized to exploit the above                  theoretical breakthrough and encourage both further experience with             practical application and further development of the associated theory.         The NSF support will be used to defray the travel costs of both U.S.            and foreign participants, whose attendance is deemed essential to the           workshop's success.  A grant award of $5000 from the CSP program is             recommended.",
