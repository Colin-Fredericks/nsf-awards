 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will supply shipboard scientific support equipment                 for the research vessel WEATHERBIRD, operated by the Bermuda                    Biological Station, and dedicated to use in support of ocean                    science research.                                                                                                                                               The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds               for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe                      conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support                for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the                deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational                equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite                        receivers to pin point the location of research sites,                          communication equipment including radio transceivers and                        satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data                            communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats                  for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.                                                                                                   The Project Director, Howard S. Barnes is fully qualified to                    direct this project having had considerable experience in                       overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard                        equipment.                                                                                                                                                      This project will allow the institution to overhaul a winch for                 improve wire handling, acquire a fathometer for accurate depth                  measurements, obtain a wind monitor, and install a radio for                    improved ship to shore communications.  It will also improve                    safety through the acquisition of exposure suits, an anchor                     winch, and an emergency pump.",
