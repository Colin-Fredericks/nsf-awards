 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objectives of this project are (1) to develop better           understanding of market-based approaches for controlling environmental          risks, and (2) to develop a theoretical model aimed at explaining the           evolution and performance of market-based risk management approaches.           As part of the study, two specific market-based risk management                 approaches will be examined:  the use of emissions trading permits and          the trading of lead rights.  For each case, data will be collected and          analyzed on (1) the rules governing the market; (2) the performance of          the market; (3) the effects of the market on the allocation of risk;            (4) the behavioral responses to the market of key participants in the           decision making process; (5) the factors affecting the emergence of the         market, and (6) the factors affecting the evolution of the market.                                                                                                   Despite the importance of market-based approaches for controlling          environmental risks, little research has been directed toward                   predicting the emergence and performance of such markets.  This                 innovative project will develop a theoretical model that will help              predict the actual performance of different market-based approaches.            It is expected that the results of the study will (1) contribute to             the development of an overall theory of market performance, and (2)             provide risk analysts and decision makers with a comprehensive and              rigorous approach for addressing different risk management problems.",
