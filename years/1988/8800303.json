 "awd_abstract_narration": "America became the leading industrial power in the world in the                 late 19th and early 20th centuries.  It continues to play a                     leading industrial role today though the United States has moved                into the \"post-industrial\" age.  While there has been a                         proliferation of secondary literature in related historical                     disciplines, a number of critical problems remain to be                         investigated concerning the roots of the American industrial                    power.  Drs. McGaw, Cooper and Smith are examining these roots                  through their study of significant aspects of American technology               in the period 1750 to 1850. Dr. McGaw will be examining the                     domestic origins of the American Industrial Revolution,                         specifically how changes in agriculture and household food                      processing affected production and consumption behavior and                     created both the raw materials supplies and the demand that                     permitted industrial innovation.  Dr. Cooper is examining the                   technology for wood working, the diffusion of changes in that                   technology, and the social effects on technological innovation by               the patent management system.  Dr. Smith is examining the \"first                stage\" of the American Industrial Revolution entailing the                      mechanization of industry.  He will then relate these                           developments to the \"second stage\" of science-based                             industrialization which followed.   Through their common focus                  on early American technology and its mid-Atlantic development,                  their regular meetings with one another to discuss research                     problems and strategies, and their participation in several on-                 going scholarly projects devoted to the social and economic                     history of the mid-Atlantic region prior to 1850, their                         collaboration promises greatly to enhance their individual work.                They also plan to interact with other historians participating in               the \"Transformation of Philadelphia Project\"  with which this                   study is associated, to bring in a series of visiting scholars,                 and to hold concluding conference and publish a volume of                       articles on early industrial technology and how it shaped the                   development of American industrial strength.",
