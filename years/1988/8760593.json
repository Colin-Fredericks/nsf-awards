 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the research program is to investigate the use                 of collimating optics with a transition-radiation source to                     produce a low cost, laboratory scale, intense, focused, soft x-                 ray source for spectroscopy.  As has been seen from the rapid                   rise in the use of synchrotron radiation, bright, relatively                    inexpensive x-ray sources are needed for materials studies and                  other scientific and medical research.  An x-ray system will be                 constructed.  This system consists of a transition radiator and                 collimating  optics, which will permit the entire radiation cone                to be focused to a 1 - 2 mm2 spot.  Flexible capillary tubes will               permit the direction of the x-rays to be changed.  Phase I                      research will be used to test the optics and the feasibility of                 the source for spectroscopy.  A computer-driven ray-tracing                     program has been developed to optimize the design of the x-ray                  optics.  Preliminary experiments at Adelphi have shown that                     x-rays in the 1 - 3 ke V spectra range can be focused to a 2 mm                 diameter spot  at a distance of 1.35 m from the source.  The                    principal investigator and his colleagues were the first to                     observe soft x- rays from transition radiators and show focusing                of the radiation of large distances from the radiator.",
