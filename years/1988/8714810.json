 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fundamental goal of this research is to develop and study               mathematical models for the dynamics of structured populations in               order to explore and to contribute to the understanding of the                  effects that physiological traits which determine the growth,                   fertility and mortality rates of individuals can have on the                    dynamics at the population level.  While some models which have                 appeared in the literature will be studied and extended, the                    focus will be on the careful derivation of models for certain                   types of structured populations and multispecies interactions                   involving primarily size and developmental stages (and in some                  cases chronological age) to which an importance and interest has                been attached in the biological literature and which have not                   been previously modelled.  A full range of standard as well as                  recently developed analytical tools will be applied in order to                 gain an understanding of the resulting model dynamics and how                   they depend on the internal structure of the populations, on key                model parameters, on nonlinear density effects and on the nature                of the interspecies interactions.  Problems to be modelled were                 chosen in part because there are biological studies available for               comparison to the model results.  As part of the proposed                       research, certain recently developed analytical methods will need               to be extended in order to handle the type of models to be used                 in this study.  The numerical analysis of models is expected also               to play an important role.",
