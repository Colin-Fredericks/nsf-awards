 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop a mathematical model                    which describes the physical properties occurring in                            magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) rocket engines.  The validity of the                 model will be tested by comparing its predictions to experimental               results and its use in predicting new characteristics of MPD                    engines.                                                                                                                                                        The research is divided into three areas:  analysis,                            numerical/experiment, and prediction.  In the analysis phase,                   fluid, dissociation, electromagnetic, and state equations will be               used to determine the behavior of MPD engines.  Dimensional                     analysis permits the determination of combination of important                  parameters.  The second phase of the research is the numerical                  solution of the equations of motion.  Experimental test results                 will be duplicated by computer to verify the validity of the                    model.  The final phase involves the prediction of performance of               MPD engines under conditions which have never before been tested.               Using the model to predict in advance the performance of a new                  MPD engine is efficient and could result in considerable savings                in cost of design.",
