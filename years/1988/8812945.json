 "awd_abstract_narration": "The anti-correlation between cosmic ray fluxes and the level               of solar activity (solar modulation) is caused by magnetic field                irregularities carried by the solar wind which sweep the charged                particles out of the solar system and/or decelerate them.  Since                electrons and nuclei have greatly different charge/mass ratios                  the relation of velocity and magnetic rigidity is significantly                 different for these two particle species.  Recent observations                  have shown that the failure of the current modulation model                     simultaneously to reproduce electron and nucleon modulation is                  related to reversals of the solar magnetic field which occur                    every eleven years.  If the heliospheric magnetic field has long                range order the sign of the charge of the cosmic ray particles                  can affect their propagation.  A detailed consideration of the                  symmetries involved shows that the charge dependence should                     change when the solar field reverses.  This research program is                 designed to extend measurements of the charge dependence of                     cosmic ray solar modulation through comparison of electron data                 to be obtained under this grant with electron an proton data                    available from our instrument on the ICE spacecraft as well as                  other data from the literature.  This investigation will                        determine the extent to which the large scale order of the                      heliospheric magnetic field is important in determining the                     trajectories of charged particles in the heliosphere.",
