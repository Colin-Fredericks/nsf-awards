 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fast pulsed diffuse discharges are widely used for pulsed power                 applications such as gas lasers and switches.  A goal in both fields            is to reduce the rise and fall times of these discharges and to                 develop tools to predict their time dependent behavior.  Most diffuse           discharges are weakly ionized and their behavior is dominated by                collisions of electrons and neutrals.  The current research project is          concerned with their influence of specific components in a gas mixture          on the discharge characteristic and on the time dependent behavior of           the discharge to allow its optimization for specific applications.              This proposal addresses investigations of the transient behavior of             gas discharges under the influence of fast changes of reduced electric          field strength E/N and/or an electron source, S.  The reduction of              rise and fall times into the nansecond and sub-nanosecond region                requires considering the non steady state electron kinetic and its              influence on the time dependent behavior of the discharge.  The work            includes theoretical investigations aimed towards a description of the          non equilibrium electron kinetic and experimental investigations which          will allow to prove the theoretical results.  The theoretical                   investigations are based on a new numerical method, the Monte Carlo             Flux method, which is being developed.  This method improves the                resolution function and simplifies calculations of transient                    processes.  A suitable experimental set up to operate fast pulsed               discharges will be designed and constructed and experiments will be             performed to prove these model calculations.",
