 "awd_abstract_narration": "Enzymatic resolution is a potentially powerful approach for the                 separation of the stereoisomers.  Lipases and carboxyesterases                  have been extensively studied for this purpose.  Many lipase                    substrates, complex molecules with chiral centers, are poorly                   soluble in water.  Thus bioconversions must be performed in                     multiphase, emulsion-type enzyme reactors with three phases                     present--organic, aqueous, and immobilized enzyme.                                                                                                              Multiphase and extractive membrane reactors, based on hollow-                   fiber modules, offer several engineering advantages over                        conventional reactors by promoting efficient mass transfer and                  simplifying phase and product separation.  This Phase II proposal seeks         to optimize membrane bioreactor performance (productivity                       and enzyme stability), demonstrate enzymatic resolution in a                    large-scale module, and conduct both a technical and economic                   evaluation of an integrated important analgesic, (S)-Ibuprofen.                                                                                                 New drugs under development are increasingly more complex in                    structure and require, in many cases, more elaborate purification               schemes.  The body is highly specific in regard to the                          recognition of the three-dimensional structure (i.e.,                           streoisomers) of a pharmaceutical and, therefore, the drug needs  to be         of high stereochemical purity for it to be active.                              Extensive research has been conducted on the use of enzymes for                 the separation of mixtures of steroisomers.  However, the                       commercialization of this technology must overcome certain                      engineering roadblocks to be economically feasible.                                                                                                             The use of a novel enzyme reactor, based on membranes, has been                 shown to successfully address many of these problems in Phase I                 studies.  This Phase II proposal seeks to optimize membrane                     bioreactor performance, demonstrate enzymatic resolution in a                   large-scale system, and conduct both a technical and economic                   evaluation of an integrated, enzymatic-resolution process for the               production of (S)-Ibuprofen.",
