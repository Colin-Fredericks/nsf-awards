 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal is for a 3-day Workshop, to be attended by the major                   researchers in Discrete Event Dynamics Systems.  It is impractical to           obtain reviews from persons who are knowledgeable but uninvolved.  The          DEDS area has been gradually growing.  Operations research problems in          manufacturing systems have led to System Theory models (such as markov          decision processes) and larger areas of application (communication              protocols, e.g.).  The work of several major figures in Operation               Research and System Theory can now be compared and unified approaches           synthesized.  The goal of the Workshop, to provide future mission-              oriented research applications, will give it focus;  the rapidly                developing field makes such a Workshop timely;  and the Budget is               realistic.  In view of the probable future impact of the Workshop on            DEDS research, I recommend awarding this proposal a grant in the                amount requested.",
