 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a three year project aimed at the elementary and junior high            school teachers in six Appalachian counties of northeast Mississippi.           The project involves administrators, supervisors, coordinators, and             teachers from 52 schools representing 14 rural school districts. The            administrators receive the equivalent of three full days of orientation         and instruction to give them familiarity with the trust, scope, and             expectations of the project. Some of these activities are funded from           external sources. During the first summer the supervisors are involved          in over 100 hours of workshop experiences to enable them to prepare             their own workshops for teachers in their districts. The participants           are to establish a mathematics resource center and laboratory in each of        the 52 elementary and junior high schools in which they will conduct            inservice sessions that extend the workshop to other teachers at their          schools. Also, there is a component involving parents as well as                business and industrial leaders in the communities. The second and third        summers of the project place emphasis on developing master teachers who         are to serve as resource personnel at the targeted schools. The                 mathematics content of the courses is a blend between skill building and        problem solving and covers the main topic areas in the school program.          There are, for example, sessions underlying arithmetic topics as well as        geometry and pre-algebra. The pedagogical component includes sessions on        diagnosis, remediation, and methods of materials development. Follow-up         activities during each of the intermediate years have the staff helping         the leaders and master teachers conducting staff development sessions           for other teachers in the districts. These activities take place                primarily in the resource centers.",
