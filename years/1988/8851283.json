 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Physics Department at Lewis and Clark College is developing a               modern laboratory for teaching solid state physics.  Building on                a base of introductory and intermediate courses, the Physics                    faculty has recently turned its attention to the development of a               series of advanced laboratory/student-faculty research                          investigations which will serve to emphasize topics being studied               in Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics, Modern Physics,                    Solid State Physics and Quantum Mechanics.                                                                                                                      Solid State Physics was selected to illustrate fundamental                      interactions of electrons with matter.  The development of this                 laboratory is also very practical in view of the graduate and                   career plans of undergraduate physics majors.  The laboratory                   will support a range of experiments of differing degrees of                     sophistication.  A number of pieces of equipment for crystal                    growth and electrical and optical measurements have or are being                acquired.                                                                                                                                                       The central piece of equipment in this project is a                             superconducting magnet and variable temperature cryostat to be                  used to investigate fundamental properties of materials.  The                   system is capable of temperatures from 1.5 to 300 Kelvin and                    magnetic fields up to ten Tesla.  This system will be used by                   students enrolled in Advanced Laboratory, Undergraduate Research,               or student-faculty collaborative research.  Examples of concepts                to be studied are:  magnetic susceptibility, specific heat,                     electrical conductivity, Landau quantization, electronic band                   structure, superconductivity, and semiconductor carrier                         concentration.                                                                                                                                                  The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal                 sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
