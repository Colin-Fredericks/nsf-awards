 "awd_abstract_narration": "In-depth interviews conducted with both employers and employees in         four census tracts with high female employment in Worcester,                    Massachusetts will elucidate the processes by which employment                  opportunities for females become spatially concentrated and segregated          from male employment within metropolitan regions.  A control group of           males and their employers will also be interviewed to identify the              importance of confounding variables such as income and education.  This         research will integrate the perceptions and actions of employers and            employees with aggregate contextual information regarding the existence         of gender segregation by industry, occupation, and location.                         Professors Hanson and Pratt have in previous work documented               distinct clusters of female-dominated industries and occupations within         metropolitan areas.  This project will build upon and extend their              earlier research by identifying the forces that generate the gender             segregation of employment in space and by developing an integrated              theoretical explanation of why gender segregation by industry,                  occupation, and location occurs.  It will also highlight the role of            location in particular by exploring the degree to which residence in            particular places constrains the choices women have among different             kinds of jobs and careers.  Professor Hanson and Pratt's research will          advance our understanding of metropolitan labor markets and the                 locations of employment opportunities within metropolitan areas.  In            addition to such basic theoretical advances, their work will yield              results that will be useful for policy makers and planners concerned            with maximizing labor force effectiveness and productivity.",
