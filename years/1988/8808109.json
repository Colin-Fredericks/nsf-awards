 "awd_abstract_narration": "The function of conspicuous coloration displayed by breeding                    males of many different species has been a topic of much                        speculation in biology, but little solid evidence has yet been                  obtained.                                                                                                                                                       Dr. Kodric-Brown will perform experiments to investigate the                    function of the bright blue breeding coloration of male pupfish.                Only males with breeding territories develop this coloration and                reproduce.  The blue breeding coloration may serve two functions:               (1) facilitate acquisition and defense of a breeding territory                  through competition with other males, and (2) attract females to                a male's territory.                                                                                                                                             Dr. Kodric-Brown will introduce already-breeding males with well-               developed breeding coloration and non-breeding males lacking this               coloration into large tanks.  She will experimentally manipulate                (a) material on the bottom of the tank, to determine the                        importance of suitable breeding substrate for the development of                breeding coloration, (b) competitive interactions among males, to               determine the importance of dominance in the development of                     breeding coloration, and (c) female spawning behavior, to                       determine how male breeding coloration influences female choice                 of particular males.  Also, the appearance of males will be                     experimentally altered by dyeing them with a blue dye.                                                                                                          This study will provide insights into the types of traits                       important in mate recognition and male dominance, and the                       underlying mechanisms that are responsible for their development.               Such traits act as important social signals and are virtually                   ubiquitous in sexually reproducing organisms.  They are                         especially important in preventing hybridization, thus                          maintaining the integrity of species in our rapidly deteriorating               aquatic environments.",
