Program                    participants will be 18 high-ability/high-potential science-oriented            students.  The program includes a combination of college-level                  instruction on the campus of Florida Institute of Technology, with              camping, hiking and field work in the Great Smoky Mountains National            Park, Tennessee.                                                                                                                                                Program participants will learn basic concepts of environmental science         and terrestrial ecology, and will apply these concepts in laboratory            and field studies.  The laboratory and fields studies will focus on             comparisons between the biotic and abiotic factors of various naturally         occurring ecological communities.",
