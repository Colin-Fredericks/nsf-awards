 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sophisticated scientific workstations running powerful software                 are essential tools for practicing scientists and engineers, but                undergraduate curricula nationwide are not responding vigorously                to the challenge and opportunity provided by these devices.  In                 response, the Lawrence Department of Physics will construct a                   computation laboratory to support a major restructuring of its                  undergraduate physics curriculum.  The first phase of this                      project will build familiarity with computer-based tools by                     introducing suitable examples and exercises into the                            intermediate-level core of courses.  As the students advance,                   more sophisticated exercises will be incorporated into advanced                 offerings.  Through curricular revision, a departmental                         environment will be created within which Lawrence undergraduates                will become expert at using state-of-the-art computing tools                    intelligently, effectively, extensively, and independently.  At                 the same time, the Department will be conducting a pilot project                whose results will influence the course of physics instruction                  at other schools during the coming decades.                                                                                                                     The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal                 sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
