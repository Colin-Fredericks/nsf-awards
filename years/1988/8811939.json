Negele at                    Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge.  The                          project will be in the area of Nuclear Chromodynamics, the                      role of quarks and gluons in determining the structure and                      properties of atomic nuclei.  The MIT physics group has taken                   the lead in attacking the challenging task of unravelling the                   quarks structure of nuclei.  The efforts are concentrated on                    development of nucleon models, calculation of elastic                           scattering form factors, direct excitation of quark and color                   degrees of freedom, direct measurements of quark momentum in                    very high energy deeply inelastic electron scattering, and                      creation of abnormal states of hadron matter to detect their                    momentary existance.  The QAU group is also deeply interested                   in this approach.                                                                                                                                               Scope:  The MIT - QAU collaboration has started, and there                      already exists one paper in the area of Nuclear                                 Chromodynamics written by Hoodbhoy and R.L. Jaffee of MIT.                      Further work at QAU resulted in more publications.  It is                       likely that this collaboration will benefit both teams and                      lead to significant results in addition to building a viable                    scientific research capability in theoretical nuclear physics                   in Pakistan, as envisioned in the Science in Developing                         Countries Program.",
