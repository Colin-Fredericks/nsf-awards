 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mesoscale Cyclonic Eddies Formed Near the Hawaiian Islands                 will be utilized to study the effects of upwelling events on the                productivity, composition, biomass, and physiology of open-ocean                phytoplankton populations.  Recent technical and methodological                 advances will be utilized to more accurately determine the ratio                of new production to total production (f-ratio) and the temporal                and spatial variability of that ratio in the open ocean.  Both                  simple empirical models and more sophisticated compartmental                    models will be tested for their ability to describe and explain                 observed f-ratio variations.  Estimates of new production will be               obtained using a recently developed nitrate analysis method with                a precision of +/- 2nM.  Total production will be estimated from                the incorporation of C-14 labeled inorganic carbon into protein.                This experimental approach will eliminate many of the potential                 artifacts and problems associated with traditional f-ratio                      studies, including perturbations caused by the addition of non-                 tracer amounts of N-15, isotope dilution of the substrate pool,                 difficulty in measuring ambient substrate concentrations, the                   need to measure uptake of at least three forms of dissolved N,                  and the fact that bacteria may account for a significant fraction               of the uptake of ammonium.                                                           The biological productivity of the ocean varies                            geographically to a great degree.  In mid-basin subtropical areas               such as thevicinity of the Hawaiian Islands, production is                      typically relatively low.  However, physical features of the                    local waters such as the circular eddies found to the west of the               islands can enhance productivity by increasing the supply of                    nutrients for plant growth to surface waters.  Laws and Bienfang                will use state of the art techniques to measure these variations                in biological production and relate it to the structure of the                  planktonic community.  They will make sensitive measurements of                 new production, a parameter that is critical in estimating the                  flux of organic material from surface waters and its availability               for harvestable resources.  Conducting the studies in an area                   where oceanic eddies are found will provide a wide range of                     biological oceanographic conditions likely to be found in the                   open ocean.",
