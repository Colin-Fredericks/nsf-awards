 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a seminar, jointly organized                            by Professor Arthur Bienenstock of Stanford University                          and Dr. C.E. Williams and D. Raoux of the Laboratoire                           de l'Utilisation du Rayonnement Electromagnetique                               (LURE), University of Paris XI, Orsay, on the subject                           of Utilization of Anomalous X-Ray Scattering.  The                              seminar will bring together scientists from the                                 various disciplines expected to benefit from this                               newly emerging materials analysis technique in order                            to plan for the optimum utilization of new X-ray                                sources now being built.  Biologists, chemists,                                 materials scientists, and physicists will be invited                            to discuss applications of this technique to the                                study, for example, of amorphous and crystalline                                solids, protein crystals, metallurgy, colloids, and                             poorly crystallized solids.  This seminar should lead                           to a rapid diffusion of this new technique among the                            various scientific communities represented, and also                            should generate new ideas for applications and                                  techniques.                                                                                                                                                     The Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory and LURE                          are laboratories which have been pioneers in this                               field.  The timing of the seminar is opportune in                               light of the fact that three new high-brightness X-ray                          sources--two in the U.S. and one in France--are                                 presently being developed.",
