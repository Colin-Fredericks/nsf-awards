Four areas of science and                   mathematics education will be included in the indicator system:                 teachers and teaching quality; curriculum and instruction;                      participation (especially, that of women and minorities); and,                  achievement and outcomes.  The methods to be used to develop the                indicator system will be to: 1) synthesize data from an array of                national data bases to obtain additional information on the                     condition of science and mathematics education; 2) evaluate the                 results to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the existing               data and the indicators that can be built from them; and, 3) use                a wider variety of data--including data that are not nationally                 representative--to explore the potential of components of                       measures that might be useful for future data collection efforts.                                                                                               Because this is an exploratory project (over a proposed two-year                period) a review will be conducted of it near the end of the                    first year's effort to decide whether to continue funding for the               full duration.",
