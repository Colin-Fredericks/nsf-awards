 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-intrusive Rayleigh scattering laser anemometry and a                        modular  flow test facility are used systematically to                          explore turbulent transport and entrainment in a modular flow                   fixture that builds sequentially in geometrical complexity                      from a simple free jet to a complex flow reactor.  Secondary                    goals address the evaluation of fine-wire thermocouple                          performance and the development of appropriate methods to                       obtain complete two-dimensional field information from                          sparse, point measurements.  In the proposed work, the test                     matrix will be concluded with a study of the central jet                        surrounded by a swirling coannular jet, up to and including                     the complex flow model reactor.                                                                                                                                 The program proposed is directed to an enhanced understanding                   of turbulent mixing in recirculating combusting flows,                          dominated by a high degree of swirl.  The practical                             significance of the proposed research is that the flows                         selected for study are found in the majority of continuous                      combustion systems, such as gas turbine combustors, boilers,                    furnaces, and incinerators.  The understanding of the                           turbulent mixing associated with these flows is timely in                       view of the growing restrictions in operation such                              as fuel consumption, emissions, noise, and fuel quality.",
