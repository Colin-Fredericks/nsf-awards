 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nitrogen compounds are among the most important chemical                   species involved in the complex chemical and photochemical                      processes in the global troposphere.  Interactions of odd-                      nitrogen compounds with non-methane hydrocarbons and a variety of               radical species have been shown to have a potential impact on                   atmospheric chemistry on local, regional, and global scales.                    Because of their central role in atmospheric chemistry, a                       complete study of the cycle of odd-nitrogen compounds has been                  recommended as part of an overall Global Tropospheric Chemistry                 Program.                                                                             Alkyl nitrates are photochemical products of atmospheric                   hydrocarbon oxidation in the presence of reactive oxides of                     nitrogen.  Recent measurements of alkyl nitrates that these                     compounds may constitute a significant fraction of the total                    reactive nitrogen in the \"clean\" troposphere.  Because of their                 potential contribution in the nitrogen budget and their                         significance to oxidant chemistry, detailed information is                      required to understand the sources, composition, concentration                  and variability of alkyl nitrate in the global troposphere.  The                objectives of this research are to accurately measure relevant                  alkyl nitrate compounds in the troposphere, to estimate the                     contribution of alkyl nitrates to the budget of reactive nitrogen               species in the troposphere, and to investigate the long-range                   transport of alkyl nitrates to remote marine areas.",
