 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research proposal is to gain an                      insight into the relatively unexplored area of surface waviness                 (or wrinkling) which can occur during sheet metal forming, to                   obtain a fundamental understanding of the influence of material                 parameters on those process parameters that cause surface                       waviness, and to provide technical guidelines for avoiding such                 defects in forming high-strength materials.  The research will                  include: (1) Experimental studies on rectangular and square punch               stretching of peripherally clamped sheet metals, (2) Analysis of                rectangular and square punch stretching, (3) Study of various                   constitutive equations and establishment of those best suited for               predicting surface waviness/wrinkling in sheet metal, (4)                       Experimental determination of biaxial strength of selected                      materials, and (5) Establishment of process design guidelines for               forming panels without surface waviness and testing those                       guidelines on an actual stamping process.  Surface waviness is                  one of the main types of failures in the sheet metal forming                    process which is a manufacturing process employed in many                       industries.  The proposed research should lead to a better                      understanding of this failure problem and result in an                          improvement in the sheet metal forming process.  This research                  will be conducted jointly by two universities with collaboration                from a national laboratory and an industrial company.",
