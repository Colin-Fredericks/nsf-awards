 "awd_abstract_narration": "The social insects have always posed an evolutionary puzzle             to biologists.  They have evolved worker castes which rarely or                 never reproduce.  But how can genes that prevent reproduction                   ever become common in populations?  The answer is that workers                  aid the reproduction of relatives who, though they do not express               the genes for worker behavior, do possess them and transmit them                to their offspring.  A combination of theory and empirical                      evidence suggests that the aid given must be considerable:                      workers must generally increase the reproduction of their                       relatives by more than the amount that they decrease their own                  reproduction.                                                                           How such reproductive efficiencies of scale can be achieved             is the main theme of the proposed research, focusing on                         primitively social insects that have not evolved caste                          specializations.  Mathematical models will show how simple and                  plausible patterns of mortality and reproductive timing can lead                to these efficiencies of scale.  Field studies of wasps will                    serve to test the models.  The result of this work will be a                    better understanding of why some species engage in altruistic                   behavior and why others do not.  These insights may lead to the                 recognition of similarities underlying the evolution of altruism                in the social insects and higher animals.",
