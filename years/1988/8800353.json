 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the area of analytical and surface chemistry,                broadly defined.  During the ten week period between 1 June 1988                and 9 August 1988, five faculty members from colleges that do not               offer the PhD degree in chemistry will carry out collaborative                  research with seven analytical and surface chemistry faculty                    members at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC).               Research participants from the undergraduate institutions will be               selected from among applicant who respond to UNC's announcement of              the summer research program.  This activity is analogous to the                 support of faculty from undergraduate institutions through NSF                  Research Opportunity Awards (ROAs) and represents one of UNC's                  attacks on the national crisis in production of PhD chemists with               expertise in the area of analytical and surface chemistry.  In                  this project, participating faculty from the undergraduate                      institutions will not necessarily have prearranged their summer                 research activities with UNC analytical faculty members, rather                 they will establish their collaborative arrangements after they                 have had an opportunity to consider fully all of the research                   programs of the host institution participating faculty members.                 In addition to the research focus of the activity, UNC faculty and              scientists from industrial laboratories in nearby Research                      Triangle Park will present a series of lectures covering frontier               research tools and topics that constitute modern analytical and                 surface chemistry and discuss research opportunities in this broad              field.  Also, representatives from funding agencies from both                   Federal and private sectors that have a strong commitment to the                support of quality research programs in undergraduate institutions              will address the participants and describe the mechanisms whereby               such support can be competitively sought.  One particularly                     important goal of this project is to assist the participating                   faculty from undergraduate institutions to begin to establish a                 network of vital academic analytical chemists in four-year                      institutions in the southeastern United States that can help to                 address vigorously the problem of attracting outstanding young                  talent to the challenging and technologically important subfield                of analytical and surface chemistry.",
