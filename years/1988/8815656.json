 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will investigate the influence of mechanical              stress on the growth programs of vascular endothelial cell in vitro,            including signal transduction mechanisms.  Endothelial cell, as well            as other cell types for comparison, will be studied in different                mechanical stress environments, and alterations in endothelial cell             growth programs will be  determined through measurements of cell                proliferation and the expression of growth-related genes.  A common             set of membrane signaling mechanisms may be involved in both                    cytoskeletal rearrangement and growth program changes induced by                endothelial cells in mechanical stresses, and regional alterations in           intracellular calcium ion concentrations to cytoskeletal                        rearrangements will be assessed.  In vivo  endothelial cells are in a           non-growth promoting mode, while in vitro  basally release growth               promoting substances.  This difference is believed to be due to the             artificial, non-physiologic nature of the static culture environment,           which is devoid of mechanical stress.  The results should allow cell            culture environments to be engineered so as to make the cell culture            more like a natural environment.  This procedure will aid in using              culture experiments to understand the processes involved in the                 maintenance, repair, and growth of vascular components.",
