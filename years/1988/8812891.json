 "awd_abstract_narration": "Werner Heisenberg was at the center of theoretical physics in                   Germany during much of the 20th century.  He was the creator of                 quantum mechanics and the inventor of the uncertainty principle.                He was a major contributor to the development of matrix                         mechanics, quantum field theory, and S-matrix formalism.                        Further, his life and activities touched some of the most                       turbulent events of recent German and World history.  He was                    enlisted by various political regimes in Germany, from the Weimar               Republic through the Third Reich and into the post-war Federal                  Republic of Germany.  During World War II, he headed the Nazi                   sponsored atomic bomb project.  Under this grant, Dr. Cassidy                   will complete his biography of Werner Heisenberg.  This study                   will cover all phases of Heisenberg's life and work, integrating                them to wider issues in history, science, philosophy, culture,                  and politics.  He will examine primary sources in extensive                     archival records and hitherto unexamined private papers.  This                  study promises greatly to enhance our understanding of the                      development of contemporary physics, the training of German elite               scientists, and the role of physics in the government of Germany                over a half century period.",
