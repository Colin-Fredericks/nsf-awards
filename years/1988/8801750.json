 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is widely assumed that Ca is a regulator of mitosis.                    Changes in the intracellular free \u0131Ca! could modulate a variety of              processes that control the formation and/or function of the mitotic             apparatus.  Recent studies show that free \u0131Ca! changes during                   mitosis; however, there are reported differences concerning the                 timing, kinetics, and location of these changes.  The problem will              first be clarified by comparing the timing and kinetics of Ca                   transients in a single cell type (Tradescantia stamen hair) using two           different Ca reporting techniques: differential absorbance                      measurements from arsenazo-III-loaded cells, and light emission from            aequorin-injected cells.  Second, the timing and kinetics of Ca                 transients will be compared in cell types of different origin,                  including Tradescantia stamen hair, Haemanthus endosperm, newt lung             epithelium, and cultured kangaroo rat (PtK1) cells, to see if there             are biological variations.  Third, the role of G-binding proteins and           components of the phosphatidylinositol cycle in regulating the                  metaphase/anaphase transition will be examined.  Fourth, the roles of           Ca and calmodulin in regulating the rate of chromosome movement will            be studied, by microinjecting Ca, calmodulin, GTP-gamma-S, inositol             triphosphate, or Ca chelators directly into the living cells.  Fifth            and finally, the possible occurrence of ultrastructural changes in              the mitotic apparatus during anaphase that might be related to                  chromosome movement will be addressed, using rapid freezing and                 freeze-substitution techniques to elucidate the structure and                   periodicity of microtubule connections to other microtubules or to              the membrane and to see if changes can be related to chromosome                 movement.                                                                            Cell division is a fundamental aspect of life on earth.  In                eukaryotic cells, the orderly distribution of genetic material in the           form of mitotic chromosomes to daughter cells at each division event            is absolutely necessary for normal maintenance of individual                    organisms and populations at all stages of life.  The mechanism                 whereby this orderly distribution occurs is a complex phenomenon                involving structural and regulatory aspects.  In the proposed                   studies, Dr. Hepler will extend his previous work on mitosis, as well           as definitively address a current technical controversy in the field.",
