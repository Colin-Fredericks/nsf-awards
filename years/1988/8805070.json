 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            designed to increase the participation of minorities in scientific and          engineering research.  The program provides support to strengthen the           research environments and capabilities of institutions that have                substantial minority student enrollments.  Eligible institutions must           also have graduate programs in science or programs in engineering.              Investigators at Wayne State University will use RIMI support to study          soot emissions and the aromatic hydrocarbons associated with these              emissions.  The study will focus on the characterization of the soot            formation process by examining properties such as size, shape, and the          number density of soot particulates.  Laser diagnostics will be used            to predict the radiation heat transfer from root particulates by                measuring their optical properties.  These studies will increase our            knowledge about emission control mechanisms as they apply to engines.                                                                                           This project on radiative properties and control techniques of soot             particles will encourage more minorities to choose careers in science           and engineering in an area where the automobile industry is a major             contributor to this Nation's economy.  The principal investigator has           published extensively on the thermodynamics of engines and is well              qualified to conduct the research.",
