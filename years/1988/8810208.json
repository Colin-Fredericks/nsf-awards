 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support a study of the intermediate scale                  coupling of the solar wind, magnetosphere and ionosphere by a                   combination of analytic and numerical techniques.  Coupling on                  these scales is important and interesting, primarily due to the                 importance of non-ideal MHD processes on the dynamics.  The grant               will address three areas: nonlinear effects, compressional                      effects and kinetic effects.  Nonlinearities become quite                       important in the dynamics of small scale currents such as those                 associated with flux transfer events.  A model to describe the                  coupling between compressional and transverse MHD waves in a                    generalized geometry will be developed, and used to study the                   effect coupling may have on the generation of field-aligned                     currents and micropulsations.  The effects of single particle and               collective plasma dynamics will be investigated by means of test                particle and self-consistent plasma simulation, and these studies               will be used to improve the inclusion of these effects on MHD                   models.  The final goal will be an integration of these effects                 into an overall MHD model of auroral flux tubes and an                          understanding of the aurora itself.",
