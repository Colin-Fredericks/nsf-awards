 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            designed to increase the participation of minorities in scientific and          engineering research by providing support to strengthen the research            environment and capabilities of predominantly minority institutions.            Institutions eligible to participate in this program must have in               addition to a substantial enrollment of minority students, graduate             programs in science or programs in engineering.  Researchers at the             University of Texas at El Paso will use a RIMI planning grant to                explore surface science research possibilities in several areas.                Explorations will focus on the effect of oxygen on carbon-hydrogen              bond activation in methane, co-adsorption of alkalis and carbon                 monoxide on transition metal surfaces, and the chemical activation of           silicon-based materials on clean metal surfaces.                                                                                                                This planning grant will increase the investigator's capability to              perform surface analysis experiments and will contribute to the                 institution's long-term goal to establish a strong materials science            program.  The principal investigator has experience in surface science          studies and continues to publish extensively in refereed journals.              This RIMI planning grant will lead to activities that will encourage            more minority students to choose careers in materials science.",
