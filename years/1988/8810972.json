Remote sensing can enhance               basin analysis by providing large quantities of data more                       efficiently and more easily than can be accomplished through field              research alone.  In addition, the regional perspective shown in                 satellite images can stimulate new questions and insights into a                geologic problem and reveal features that are not readily visible               on the ground.                                                                       This research is an expansion of ongoing field research of                 alluvial deposits in the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming from a local to a               regional scale by using spectral data from satellite images and                 digital image processing techniques.  The major objective is to                 improve understanding of the sedimentologic and tectonic processes              which produced the alluvial architecture of the lower Eocene                    Willwood Formation.  The second goal is to test and refine                      concepts of large-scale paleosol cycles determined during the past              several years of research on the Willwood Formation.  This project              is designed to broaden the Principal Investigator's scientific                  expertise and research capabilities by providing experience with                modern remote  sensing techniques and data processing.  It offers               a rare opportunity to explore innovative techniques that can be                 used not only in studying the developmental history of the Bighorn              Basin but also in future research projects.",
