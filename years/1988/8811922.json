Scientists played                 only a marginal role, however, in this First World War.  It was                 only with the Second War that scientists, most especially                       physicists, made significant contributions to the winning                       effort.  These physicists came away from the War convinced that                 they now had a critical role to play in defence policies.                       Needless to say, the U.S. government agreed with this conclusion.                                                                                               Dr. Aaserud has been studying the role of these physicists,                     concentrating on a specific historical investigation of the first                                                                                               15 years of the \"JASON\" group of scientists.                                                                                                                    JASON was established around the start of 1960 as a means to                    involve a new generation of eminent scientists in national                      security advice for the U. S. government.  Since the initiative                 came from a group of older physicists who had been advisers                                                                                                     during the Second World War, the large majority of JASON would                                                                                                  consist of physicists.  As such, the group provides an eminent                                                                                                  example of the close relationship between the physics and defense                                                                                               communities after the Second World War.  However, the JASON                                                                                                     members, or \"JASONs,\" were not just physicists turned government                                                                                                advisers.  Doing their advising, mostly during summers, they                                                                                                    remained in their scientific positions and continued to make                                                                                                    important contributions to physics.  Indeed, since most JASONs                                                                                                  had academic positions and worked in the prestigious field of                                                                                                   theoretical high-energy physics, JASON membership was one of the                                                                                                highest signs of honor within the physics community itself.  A                                                                                                  historical study of JASON thus promises to shed light not only on                                                                                               the influence of physicists in government advising, but also on                                                                                                 how such activities feed back on the theory and practice of                                                                                                     physics.",
