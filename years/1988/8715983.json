 "awd_abstract_narration": "A large, x-ray selected sample of extragalactic objects found                   \"serendipitously\" in Einstein Observatory Imaging Proportional                  Counter exposures at high galactic latitude will be optically                   identified and further investigated.  The primary objectives of                 this study will be to measure the x-ray luminosity function and                 cosmological evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs),                        including quasi-stellar objects (QSOs), quasars and Seyfert                     galaxies, BL Lacertae objects and clusters of galaxies.  For the                BL Lacertae objects and clusters, x-ray selection offers the only               objective and complete sample approach toward studying these                    objects and hence finds AGNs not easily found by any other means                (thus complementing radio and optical selection techniques).                    Once obtained, these basic data will be used to achieve the                     following major goals:                                                          (1). To measure the x-ray luminosity function and cosmological                  evolution of AGNs, BL Lacs and clusters of galaxies;                            (2). To integrate these luminosity functions to obtain the                      discrete source contribution to the x-ray background to a higher                accuracy than previously;                                                       (3).  To compare the cosmological evolution of BL Lacs with the                 evolution of AGNs to determine the relationship between BL Lacs                 and quasars;                                                                    (4).  To measure the cosmological evolution of x-ray emission in                clusters of galaxies, to z equal to a redshift of 0.3, to compare               with models of the evolution of cluster potential wells with                    cosmic time;                                                                    (5).  To accurately measure the absolute surface density of                     extragalactic x-ray sources and their observed x-ray, radio and                 optical characteristics.",
