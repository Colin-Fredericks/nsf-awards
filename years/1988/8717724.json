 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cranchiate cephalopods are a diverse family of squids that              are a dominant component in the world's oceans.  They constitute                an important link in the food web in mid-water depth intervals.                 Dr. Nancy Voss has held several NSF awards for systematic,                      biogeographic and evolutionary study of the family.  She has                    requested renewed support for the production of monographic                     revisions of two genera, and for a biogeographic synthesis of 13                genera in the family.  This project is a natural continuation of                past contributions and will lead eventually to a synthesis of the               family's evolutionary and biogeographic history.                                        The proposed research has wide implications for study of the            evolution and distribution of other cephalopods, and of other                   members of the pelagic fauna.  Applied scientists will have the                 benefit of improved identification criteria and superbly                        illustrated guides to species.",
