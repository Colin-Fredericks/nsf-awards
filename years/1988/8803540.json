 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern plate tectonic theory is compatible with the idea that much         of eastern New England consists of allochthonous terranes that were             accreted to North America during orogenesis, however, present data do           not allow discrimination between several hypotheses concerning which            orogenic event accompanied which accretion event.  This project will            attempt to bracket the timing of metamorphism  and the timing of fault          activity at terrane boundaries across a transect in eastern                     Connecticut.  Argon-argon age spectra from hornblende, muscovite,               biotite and feldspar will be measured in rocks collected from the               Avalon, Putman-Nashoba and Merrimac terranes and from the tectonically          important Lake Char, Tatnik and Clinton-Newbury boundaries.  These data         will be used to determine if terrane juxta position occurred pre-or             post-metamorphism and the degree of displacement on faults and thereby          provide considerable constraints on the timing of tectonic events               during Paleozoic activity.",
