 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support is requested for a research conference to be held in the           spring of 1988 on the subject of phosphoinositides as sources of second         messengers in plant growth and development.  The area of second                 messengers currently is one of the rapid growth areas in plant biology.         This is especially so for research involving the polyphosphoinositides          where a role as a major second messenger system in animal cells has             emerged during the last decade.  Our goal is to bring a select group of         experts in the area of plant second messengers together with those whose        work has focused on inositol metabolism to discuss critically the second        messenger concept in plants and the possibility that inositol phosphates        together with protein kinases and calcium fulfill such a role in hormone        responses.  While polyphosphoinositides have quite clearly been shown to        occur in plants and to be modulated under certain developmental                 conditions, a second messenger role remains to be proven for these              substances in plants, and the field is certainly very much in need of           critical evaluation.                                                                 This conference will be designed to foster interaction among               participants with a view toward the emergence of new paradigms for the          understanding of the mechanisms of second messenger signalling in               plants, and the role of second messengers in plant growth and                   development.",
