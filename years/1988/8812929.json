 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable the State University of New York at Albany          to purchase Earth Resources Data Analysis Systems (ERDAS) software and          supporting hardware for use in several research projects.  ERDAS is a           microcomputer-based analysis system that does not require special               support from a central computer center.  It is a stand-alone, turn-key          system that is easy to manage and has low maintenance costs.  It is a           flexible geographic information system (GIS) that will significantly            augment the research capabilities of the several academic departments           and faculty members who will use the equipment.  The equipment will             also improve instructional programs at the graduate level in a number           of departments and curricula.                                                        The research programs that will originally benefit from the                hardware and software purchased with this award are a project to model          relationships between satellite radar response patterns and                     environmental conditions, an investigation based on processing digital          images from multiple sources to determine causes of forest damage in            the Saar Region of West Germany, and an examination of the potential of         personal computer-based image processing and GIS systems for assisting          archaeological exploration in Crete.  In addition to supporting these           and other research projects, the award will provide opportunities to            advance our understanding of basic questions concerning the                     interpretation of radar imagery for earth science applications.",
