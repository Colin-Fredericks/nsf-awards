 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research is primarily experimental but it utilizes advanced                 analysis techniques for determining parameters and functions from               transient measurements.  Two different types of transient heat                  transfer experiments are to be performed and both are multi-                    dimensional.  The first type of experiments involves the                        simultaneous determination of directional thermal conductivities                in a fiber-epoxy composite material and its density-specific heat               product.  The second type involves quenching of heated spheres in               cooling baths.  This has application to processing of materials                 to improve hardness and other metallurgical properties.  Both of                these experiments are to be analyzed using two-dimensional                      inverse computer programs developed at Michigan State University;               these programs incorporate a general, direct heat conduction                    problem solver, TOPAZ, which was developed at Lawrence Livermore                Research Laboratory.                                                                                                                                            Fiber-filled epoxy composites are very important advanced                       materials.  They have special properties that make them uniquely                suited for aerospace and aeronautical applications.  One of the                 special characteristics is their strongly directional properties,               including thermal conductivity.  This research is to use                        previously-developed parameter and function estimation techniques               in the analysis of two-dimensional experiments for the                          measurement of directional thermal conductivities.  This research               is important because the thermal conductivity values are needed                 in the intelligent curing and processing and the design of                      components using these materials.  Directional-dependent thermal                conductivity can be difficult to measure in the usual one-dimensional           experiments because the specimens are frequently restricted to being            quite thin for thermal testing purposes.  Two-dimensional transient             experiments do not have the same restrictions.  Furthermore the new             combined analysis and experimental techniques have the capability to            open new possibilities in such tests, including in situ tests,                  biological materials, and advanced directional materials such as                fiber-based composites and the new superconductivity materials.  Some           quenching experiments are also to be performed.  The various                    experiments have the potential of advancing the theory of combined              parameters and function estimation because the estimation techniques            depend critically upon the measurement accuracy and errors.",
