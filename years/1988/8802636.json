It is meant to                        inaugurate a fresh mathematical collaboration between the                       University of Florida and the University of the Netherlands                     Antilles, which in the long run will become a key component of a                more general scientific exchange between the U.S. and the                       Caribbean basin.  Also, the conference represents an opportunity                to place ordered algebraic structures in an international forum,                providing an opportunity for those in the mathematically                        underdeveloped Caribbean region to come into contact with an                    international array of outstanding mathematicians.  Attendance is               expected from a number of younger researchers from that area, and               participant support is available.                                                    Ordered algebra is an important component in the development               of mathematics, drawing from algebra, analysis, and topology, but               also replete with techniques of its own.  It is enjoying a period               of renewed interest and growth, making the subject a timely one                 for a conference.  The organizer of this conference is Professor                Jorge Martinez of the Mathematics Department of the University of               Florida.",
