 "awd_abstract_narration": "Northern Victoria Land offers the widest cross section of the                   Transantarctic Mountains, a major mountain range that separates                 East and West Antarctica and appears to be produced by extension                and rift shoulder uplift rather than by compression.  An important              graben structure, the Rennick Graben, in Northern Victoria land                 may be an extension of the Terror Rift in the Ross Sea.  Virtually              no land-based geophysical data exist for this important region.                 This investigation will acquire and interpret gravity data over                 the Rennick Graben structure and the Campbell Block, an apparently              unbroken piece of continental crust that separates the Rennick                  structure from the Terror Rift.  The goals of this work are to                  define the Rennick structure gravimetrically, to trace the                      structure southward across the Campbell Block toward the Terror                 Rift, and to study the isostatic compensation mechanism for the                 Rennick structure.  This will be a cooperative project with the                 Bundesanstalt fur Geowissenschaften, Federal Republic of Germany,               which will provide the logistics for this work during the German                Antarctic Northern Victoria Land Expedition (GANOVEX V) in the                  1988/1989 field season.  The Principal Investigator has been                    invited to lead the gravity study as an invited U.S. participant                of GANOVEX V.  The gravity data would be integrated with other                  geological, structural, magnetic and seismic refraction studies of              the GANOVEX V expedition in terms of the larger Transantarctic                  Mountain problem and the nature of the mantle anomaly that might                be the underlying cause of the Transantarctic Rift System.",
