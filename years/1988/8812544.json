 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to understand the conditions within                organizations that lead to crises so that preemptive actions can be             taken to avert them.  Although industrial crises (e.g., Bhopal, Three           Mile Island) have received increasing attention over the past decade,           much of the evidence collected to date is based on anecdotal accounts.          As a result, there is no overall theoretical framework in which to              place the present understanding of organizational crises, and little            that can be said in terms of empirically-based recommendations for              promoting behaviors designed to avoid the next catastrophe.                                                                                                     The proposed research plan involves a longitudinal study that will              compare the decision making processes of four organizations in the              chemical and electric power industries.  Two of these organizations             will have experienced major crises and exhibit poor safety records,             whereas the other two will have much better safety records and no               experience of a major crisis.  An in-depth analysis of organizational           strategies and decision processes that have affected the performance of         these companies over a ten-year period, based on both available                 secondary data sources and personal interviews, is proposed; variables          to be considered include the degree of competitiveness within an                industry, the rate of diversification within a firm, and the degree to          which decision-making authority is centralized.  The researchers                emphasize that the proposed work constitutes a pilot study,                     designed to test research methods while developing an initial                   data base.  However, the results should provide important                       theoretical insights into the nature of industrial crises and                   serve to establish preliminary guidelines for further studies in                the field.",
