 "awd_abstract_narration": "Penguins are an important component of antarctic ecosystems, and                represent 88-98% of the bird biomass of the Southern Ocean.                     Considerable information has been gathered on penguin activities                within colonies, but little is known about activities after they have           left the colony and are foraging at sea.  The diving behavior and               energetics of King and Emperor penguins is of specific interest, since          these species dive much deeper than other penguins and presumably               utilize a distinct food resource.  It has been impossible to study the          at-sea behavior of these birds until very recently.  Kooyman proposes to        study the diving behavior of Emperor and King penguins at sea using             microprocessors developed in his laboratory to store data on dive               duration, dive depth, and swimming velocity.  Information will be               obtained on the diurnal pattern of dives, prey depth distribution, and          swim speeds during travel to food patches and while catching prey.              Energetics at sea will be determined indirectly by first obtaining              laboratory measurements of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide                production at antarctic environmental temperatures and at various swim          velocities.  Using these values, a time budget estimate of energy               production will be validated by conducting a controlled laboratory              experiment using doubly labelled water for the energy determination.            Both the behavior and energetic results will be used for interspecies           comparisons of hunting strategy, success rates, and energy inputs per           trip between King and Emperor Penguins, and to test several hypotheses          regarding diving physiology.  Data should be of value to various broad          programs concerned with antarctic food webs.",
