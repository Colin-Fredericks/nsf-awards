 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding to continue research on the conflicts               and strains that working mothers with a preschool child                         experience in coping with the demands of work and family.                       profound changes in the labor force participation of mothers with               young children are reflected in a current employment rate of 60%                for mothers with a preschool child.  The fact that the majority                 of mothers with preschool children must juggle the conflicting                  demands of work and family has generated concern about their                    well-being and that of their family.  Over the past three years,                extensive information has been collected at four time points on                 approximately 180 women in the early stages of parenting and a                  career.  The study assessed (1) the stresses and conflicts they                 experience at work and at home, (2) how they are currently                      functioning as mothers, spouses and workers, and their mental                   health (3) characteristics of the women (e.g., personality),                    their work (e.g., job type), and their family situation (e.g.,                  husband's support) that might influence their ability to deal                   with the multiple demands in their lives, and (4) their                         strategies for coping with these demands.  Women were selected                  from two very different career settings:  business managers, and                college professors.  Data on the women's functioning at work and                at home were also outlined from their supervisors and husbands.                 Objective evidence of the women's functioning at work (e.g.,                    salary, time until promotion, citation) was also obtained.                      Analysis of the information collected at the first assessment                   showed that women frequently experienced conflict between work                  and family demands.  The most common way that these women dealt                 with demands on their time was to try to meet all of the demands.               The data suggested that husbands were more satisfied than their                 wives with the wife's functioning as a marital partner,  Overall,               these women appear to set high performance standards for                        themselves at work and at home, increasing the likelihood that                  they will experience role conflict.  The current research has two               aims:  First, to extend the initial analysis to test theory-based               hypotheses about the causes of changes over time in role stress                 and conflict, and mental health and general functioning.  Second,               contact will be maintained with the women who participated in the               study, so that it will be possible to recontact them in 5 years                 to assess the long term consequences of their efforts to deal                   with work and family demands during the early years of their                    career and parenting.  This research program will make a                        significant contribution to understanding how working mothers                   with young children cope with the demand of combining work and                  family roles, and to the broader literature on stress and coping                from which the theoretical framework is drawn.",
