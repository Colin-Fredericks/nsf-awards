 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this investigation is to study the                       relaxation behavior of the space charge near injecting electrical               contacts on high resistivity semiconductors.  The transport of                  charge carriers in the regime dominated by dielectric relaxation                of space charge is not well understood.  The materials being                    investigated are high purity silicon and germanium at low                       temperatures and gallium arsenide at room temperature, where they               are semi-insulating.  The transition from low resistivity to high               resistivity will be studied using current-voltage and                           capacitance-voltage techniques to observe the transition in the                 material from lifetime-dominated to relaxation=dominated                        conduction.                                                                                                                                                           High-resistivity semiconductors become more important as                  electronic circuits become more highly integrated (increasing the               density of devices on a single chip or conversely decreasing the                distance between neighboring electronic elements), which                        increases the necessity to insulate neighboring electronic                      elements from each other. Use of insulating or semi-insulating                  materials to store charge also increases the need to understand                 the dielectric relaxation effects in these materials.  The                      transport physics of these materials is poorly understood,                      partially ignored, and controversial at the present time.  This                 research aims to provide accurate and realistic data on the                     transport in semi-insulating materials.",
