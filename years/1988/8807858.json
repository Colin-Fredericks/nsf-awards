 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most                       powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                   the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                     substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                  molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                    molecules in solution.  Access to modern NMR spectroscopy is                    essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.                                                                                                   This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program                    will help the Chemistry Department at the University of Florida                 to acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer.  The areas of                         chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition                      include:                                                                                                                                                        1) Kinetic and stereochemical effects of substituents in                           pericyclic reactions                                                         2) Intramolecular ene reaction and lanthanide mediated                             cyclizations                                                                 3) Studies of metalloprotein derivatives and gas-phase                             inorganic chemistry                                                          4) The effect of strain on the chemistry of ligands sigma and                      pi-bonded to transition metals                                               5) Structure elucidation and total synthesis of insect and                         plant related natural products and new synthetic methodology                 6) Tridentate, polyfunctional ligands and catalysts for the                        polymerization of acyclic dienes.",
