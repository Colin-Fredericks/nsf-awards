 "awd_abstract_narration": "The record from human exploration and research in Antarctica has                established that prolonged exposure to the extreme and isolated                 environment is a stressful experience, and in certain                           circumstances has profound implications for health and                          performance of personnel in Antarctica.  There is some evidence which           suggests that while winter-over personnel have short-term adjustment            problems, they have a long-term decreased risk of diseases and                  illnesses triggered by stress.  The objective of this                           study is to identify and describe the sources of enduring adaptive              response to prolonged social isolation and an extreme physical                  environment.  The research team will utilize an interdisciplinary               approach, incorporating both anthropological and psychological methods,         for qualitative and quantitative assessment of short-term and long-term         consequences of the antarctic winter-over experience.  An ethnographic          study will examine the microculture of the antarctic research station           at McMurdo Sound, the processes of social interaction and extent of             social support in coping with stress, and the means of adjustment to            the \"winter-over syndrome\".  Epidemiologic methods will assess                  baseline profiles of health, stress, and coping to prospectively                examine the effect of prolonged isolation on the effectiveness of               these coping strategies and resources in reducing subsequent stress-            related illness.  This study will contribute to the understanding of            isolated microsocieties and interactions between health, environment and        personality.",
