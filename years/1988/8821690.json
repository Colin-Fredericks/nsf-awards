This conference provides a broad forum                  for the exchange of experience and information within this                      alliance.  The conference interactions will be useful to all                    participating sectors and of special utility to Federal decision                makers responsible for science and technology policy.                                                                                                           The Houston Area Research Center is presenting the 1988 Woodlands               Conference, New State Roles:  Environment, Resources and the                    Economy, on November 13-16, 1988.  STIA will support two of the                 working groups for the conference.  The working group on                        regional economic development will assess state programs and                    policies designed to stimulate regional economic growth.  The                   group will discuss existing and developing state economic                       development programs, assess the impact of those programs, and                  identify program components or development strategies that appear               to be most effective.  These strategies include relationships                   between state and federal governments, between state governments                and universities, and between state governments, universities and               the private sector (business and industry).  The working group on               strategies will examine ways to improve policy decisions at the                 state level.  This working group will take a general look at new                state roles and examine crosscutting issues of the efficiency,                  effectiveness and equity of state initiatives.//",
