 "awd_abstract_narration": "The influence of the 11 year solar cycle on weather has been               suspected for centuries, but only within the last year has real                 progress been made on describing with confidence the changes that               are occurring.  The work of Labitzke and van Loon has shown that                the effects are very different depending on the direction of                    stratospheric winds at equatorial latitudes, and it is necessary                to sort the atmospheric data (winds, temperatures, pressures,                   location and frequency of storms) according to the phase of the                 oscillation of equatorial stratospheric winds.  These winds                     change direction with a period of a little over two years, and                  are said to undergo a \"quasi-biennial oscillation\" or QBO, and it               has been found, for instance, that in the West phase of the QBO                 the storm tracks in the North Atlantic above 50o latitude move                  equatorward by about 6o at solar maximum as compared to solar                   minimum.  This award is for an analysis of tropospheric wind data               from 170 radiosonde stations for the years 1950 through 1987,                   with sorting according to the phase of the QBO, to evaluate the                 strength of the correlations with solar activity.  Hopefully,                   specific variations will emerge that will provide a clue as to                  the nature of the causitive mechanism.",
