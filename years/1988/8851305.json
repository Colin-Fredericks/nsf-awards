 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is allowing students to experience one of the most             powerful, modern techniques of chemical mixture analysis.  The ability          of the University to analyze organic substances is being greatly                enhanced by the purchase of a benchtop Gas Chromatograph-Mass                   Spectrometer (GC/MS) System.  Methods for analysis of air-borne and             water-transported organic components from the many petroleum,                   petrochemical, and agricultural industries in South Texas are being             developed in Environmental Chemistry.  In Instrumental Analysis,                applications of this modern technique are being presented for student           instruction.  With the GC/MS, experiments exploring reaction mechanisms         through product distributions and the use of isotope tracers are being          developed for the Advanced Synthesis Laboratory. All of the above               activities can apply to problems in Undergraduate Research.  The GC/MS          is reducing the separation and analysis time needed for many projects           to the point where undergraduates can realistically consider completing         some quality research during their short tenure.  The significance of           the project is great for the education of the population of South               Texas.                                                                                                                                                               The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.",
