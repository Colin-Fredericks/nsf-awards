 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Nobles Pond site, located in Stark County Ohio, is an early                 Paleo-Indian habitation site which, based on recovered stone                    artifacts, dates to the period 10,500 -11,500 B.P. (before the                  present).  Work by amateur archaeologists over many years has                   demonstrated the presence not only of numerous stone tools but                  also shown that these are grouped into several clusters which                   indicate either house floors or specific activity areas.  Because               the site is slated for housing development and will be destroyed                within the next year, Dr. Mark Seeman will conduct emergency                    excavation.  Working with students and groups of amateurs, he                   will carry out careful excavation to define these clusters and                  recover material from them.  The cultural artifacts recovered                   will be analyzed and curated.                                                                                                                                   Most information on these earliest inhabitants of the Americas                  has come from sites located in the Western United States.  While                it is clear that Paleo-Indian peoples inhabited a number of                     distinct environments, this sampling bias has prevented                         archaeologists from gaining an understanding of their broader                   subsistence and social adaptations.  Because very few sites are                 known from the mid-West, the Nobles Pond site is particularly                   important.  It is also interesting because it is located near no                major flint source.  Many Paleo Indian sites are and were                       involved in mining activities.  Thus a second factor also biases                site representation.                                                                                                                                            This research is important because it will recover information                  which would otherwise will soon be destroyed.  It will increase                 our understanding of United States prehistory and the development               of Native American cultures.  It will also shed new light on                    human subsistence adaptations.",
