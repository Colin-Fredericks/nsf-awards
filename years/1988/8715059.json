 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a study of proteins that are found only in the                  retina, with the objective of elucidating their roles in vision.                The organism used is the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.  It                offers a number of advantages as experimental subject.  The                     generation time is extremely short, it is easily reared in the                  laboratory, and, perhaps most significant, it's genetics is                     probably better worked out than for any other animal species.                                                                                                   During this project the genes encoding some of the proteins that                are specific to the retinal will be isolated, localized and their               chemical structure determined.  Mutant flies in which some of                   these proteins are defective will be prepared (many are already                 available in Dr. Pak's laboratory) and the exact nature of the                  mutations will be determined by comparison of the genes with                    those of normal \"wild type\" flies.                                                                                                                              All of this will contribute to a molecular genetic dissection of                the visual system.",
