SPROUL, owned and operated by the Scripps Institution of                  Oceanography and dedicated to use in support of ocean science                   research.                                                                                                                                                       The Construction or Conversion activity of the Oceanographic                    Centers and Facilities Section provides funds for upgrading the                 capabilities of ocean science research vessels through support of               ship construction or conversion.  Support is provided for such                  things as new deckhouses, improved science laboratory spaces,                   equipment, the lengthening of ships and even new ship                           construction.

Shor, Associate Director,                    Scripps, is fully qualified to direct this project having had                   considerable experience in overseeing similar activities.                                                                                                       This project will complete the installation of an array of                      boltdown fittings in the main deck, reconfigure a                               head/shower/washroom space for more privacy, and install an                     intake compartment for uncontaminated seawater experiments.",
