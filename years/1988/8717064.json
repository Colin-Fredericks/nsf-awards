The development of effective large-scale, high-performance                      scientific computing systems depends, at least in part, on the                  continuing interaction of algorithm developers, numerical                       analysts, computer architects, and scientists concerned with                    scientific computing.  This conference has been organized by SIAM               to bring these groups together and promote their interaction.                                                                                                   The conference will focus on the development of analytic methods,               efficient algorithms, and applications software in context with                 advances in computer architecture as applied to high-performance                systems.                                                                                                                                                        The DASC Program Director recommends support of the Society for                 Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) for FY 1987 in the                    amount of $20,500.",
