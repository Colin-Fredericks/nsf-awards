 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project emphasizes development of methods to test                     theoretical ideas in current and future accelerator                             experiments.  The first part of the project deals with current                  problems concerning the very successful and indispensable \"QCD-                 based parton model\" - the \"small-x\" behavior of the parton                      distribution functions which governs the rates of events                        expected at all future accelerators, including the                              Superconducting Super Collider (SSC); and methods of                            calculating the production of new particles initiated by heavy                  quark-partons.  The production of the Higgs particle which is                   responsible for the spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetries                    will be studied in detail.  The second part of the project                      concerns the physics of the W and Z vector bosons which mediate                 the unified electro-weak interactions.  Experimental                            consequences of the hitherto unverified tri-boson coupling of                   these gauge bosons will be explored in depth with an eye for                    incisive tests at the high-energy electron-positron colliders                   SLC and LEP.  Effects due to virtual W's and Z's, especially                    the \"effective vector boson\" approximation to high energy                       processes, will be studied.                                                          The results of this work should help specifically to                       ensure maximum effectiveness of the proposed superconducting                    supercollider accelerator, in addition to increasing our                        general knowledge of the full implications of the Standard                      (Salaam-Weinberg) Model of electroweak processes.",
