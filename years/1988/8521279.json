 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to conduct Phase II research on machining with            abrasive-waterjets under the SBIR Program.  The feasibility of                  machining with abrasive-waterjets has been demonstrated in the SBIR             Phase I research study in which both milling and turning experiments            were conducted.  In the Phase II research milling will be                       investigated in greater detail.  Linear cutting tests will be                   conducted on selected materials that are conventionally hard to                 machine.  Examples include ceramics, composites, and exotic alloys.             Basic and special cutting tests will be conducted to develop a                  fundamental understanding of the effects of milling-related                     parameters on machining results.  Models will be developed for the              prediction of quantitative and qualitative milling results as well              as cost of machining.  The response of machining parameters to                  control signals and its effect on machining results will be                     experimentally investigated.  Depth sensing techniques will be                  investigated for possible future implementation.  The investigator              is well qualified to conduct this research.  A Phase III effort is              planned to further develop and commercialize this approach.",
