 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will address the issue of features in design and             manufacturing.  Features can be given to describe physical and                  functional aspects of designs or can be extracted from designs to               describe manufacturing processes.  The relationships among features,            designs, and manufacturing will be described from several points of             view including 1) design generation, 2) product models, 3) design               databases, representation and display, 4) design analysis, 5)                   manufacturing, and 6) process planning and assembly.  The workshop              will focus on problems concerning the identification of features,               their rigorous formal characterization, and the application of these            descriptions in computational approaches to design and                          manufacturing.  Current questions concerning the role features play             in the automation of design and manufacturing will be address and               directions for future research will be outlined.                                     The workshop is especially timely owing to a growing number of             formal results in areas such as solid modelling, databases, and                 grammatical techniques that suggest that design and manufacturing               can be approached computationally.  It is felt that the goal of                 automated design and manufacturing will be significantly advanced by            bringing together researchers with a formal point of view from                  different design and manufacturing areas to share ideas.                             The workshop is planned for early 1988 at the University of                California Los Angeles.",
