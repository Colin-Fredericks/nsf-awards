 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information about animals and plants (distribution, ecology,               biology) is organized around species (kinds) in a classification.               In fishes there are about 25,000 different species (but with                    55,000 names).  There is no effective summary about our                         accumulated knowledge of fishes, although yearly summaries of the               increase in knowledge are available.  But classifications are                   always changing, as when scientific species names are changed or                species are moved to new genera or new species are found, thus                  complicating the task or keeping track of information.  The                     information on scientific names and classifications is mostly                   published in scattered small scientific papers, and follows                     certain (nomenclatural) rules on a World basis.  Computers allow                the building of databases to manage both the problems of names                  (taxonomy) and the accumulation of prior knowledge.                                  This project builds on a previous grant that allowed the                   successful preparation of a database for the 13,500 genera of                   fishes and about 6,500 literature citations having to do with the               description or status of these genera.  Preparing the \"genera of                fishes\" for publication is one of the goals of the present                      project.  The project also allows expansion to cover families,                  species (will be started but not completed), and more literature,               and allows for an examination of new software and other                         techniques (including data standards) to better meet the                        objectives.  The project will focus on designing a system that                  meets the needs of the scientific community but also can provide                on-line access to the many users in need of current biological                  information.                                                                         This project can serve as a model for other biological                     disciplines, and it should have significant value in the future,                such that it will allow better availability of information,                     including better summaries of the World's faunal diversity.",
