 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Ocean Sciences Instrumentation development project is a                    collaborative effort between Scripps Institution of Oceanography                and Amatek Corporation, Straza Division.   The project's goal is                to develop, build and test a new system of hardware and software                for acoustic Doppler current profiling.  It will involve modifi-                cations to existing Amatek Doppler speed logs that are installed                on numerous commercial ships and research vessels.  The new                     system will make use of advances in LSI chip technology, the                    availability of new peripheral cards and software for IBM AT                    compatible computers and all developed software will be access-                 ible to the user.  Knowledge gained will be in the public domain.               Amatek will provide a Doppler receiver chain module board and two               digital signal processing boards.  Scripps personnel will oversee               software development, the selection of optimal signal processing                algorithms, and preparation of documentation manuals.                                                                                                           Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers have become important tools to               derive the movement and circulation of water under a ship's path.               These devices are relatively new to academic researchers, but                   represent a major advance in scientists' ability to study ocean                 circulation.  Rapid advances are still being made in signal                     processing electronics and Doppler sonar theory and it is                       suggested that most research-oriented, commercial systems now                   available, lag behind procurable technology.  Also, restricted                  access to hardware and software preclude the scientist from being               being able to modify signal processing algorithms to make best                  use of available data.  Successful completion of this project                   will further scientists' ability to use this new technology.",
