 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal research will investigate the ability of                   commonly-used poisons and preservatives to prevent alteration                   and decomposition of organic matter collected in sediment                       traps.  In-situ experiments will be conducted under conditions                  which represents both coastal and open ocean areas, periods of                  maximum high and low productivity, and oxic and anoxic                          environments.  The experiments will test the ability of                         different poisons/preservations to prevent fundamental                          information on the relative decomposition rates of individual                   compounds and compound classes, specifically contrasting                        terrigenous and marine material in oxic and anoxic basins.                                                                                                              Two major questions will be addressed: 1) what is the                   effectiveness of various poisons and preservations on the                       composition of organic matter collected in sediment traps; and                  2) what is the extent of decomposition of preservation of the                   major classes of biogenic compounds?  The approach of answering                 these questions will be to determine concentrations of organic                  compounds (lipids, sugars, amino acids, pigments, and lignin                    oxidation products) in sediment traps chloroform, salt                          gradient, formalin, or antibiotics.  Field experiments will be                  Saanich Inlet, British Columbia, in oxic and anoxic waters, and                 at the time-series Station S off Bermuda.",
