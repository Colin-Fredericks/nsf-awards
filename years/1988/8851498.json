 "awd_abstract_narration": "The upper level chemistry laboratories are being improved by the                incorporation of Fourier-transform infrared methods.  The chemistry             courses which are using the new FT-IR are Molecular Spectroscopy,               Physical, Advanced Inorganic, Instrumental Methods of Chemical Analysis         and Biochemistry.  In addition, two chemically-oriented courses in              geology (Mineralogy and Petrology are using the FT-IR.  Compared to the         dispersive IR instruments used previously, the FT-IR provides better            resolution, higher sensitivity and superior performance in the far IR           region.  While it is difficult to use dispersive IR for the analysis of         impure liquids and solids, the FT-IR (and its diffuse reflectance and           multiple internal reflection accessories) are permitting students to            gain hands-on experience with more modern analytical techniques,                including mixture analysis and solution chemistry.  Furthermore,                students are becoming acquainted with the mathematical manipulations            and computer methods involved in Fourier-transform techniques.  As a            result of this project, students are better prepared for graduate               school and careers in industrial laboratories.
