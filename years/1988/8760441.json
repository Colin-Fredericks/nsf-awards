 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I                          project is in the general area of analytical and surface                        chemistry and in the subfield of heterogeneous catalysis.                       The thrust of this activity focusses on fundamental                             investigations of metal sulfide cluster-oxide support                           systems for hydrodesulfurization (HDS).                                         Hydrodesulfurization remains a poorly understood reaction                       despite very extensive study.  The use of cluster-derived                       catalysts for HDS represents a novel approach to                                identifying the active site for HDS and understanding its                       physicochemical nature.  This type of catalyst could also                       have improved activity and selectivity relative to                              conventionally prepared HDS catalysts.                                                                                                                          In the execution of the research plan of this project, Dr.                      Thompson will investigate the behavior of the homonuclear                       sulfide clusters Cp2Mo2(uS)2(uSH)2, Fe2(uS)2(CO)6,and                           Co6(u3S)2(CO)12.  Because these clusters contain bridging                       sulfide ligands, their metal frameworks are expected to be                      very robust and stable under HDS reaction conditions.                           These clusters will be synthesized and supported on                             partially dehydroxylated gamma-Al2O3 and MgO.  The pure and                     supported catalysts will be characterized by a variety of                       analytical techniques including infrared spectroscopy,                          surface area analysis, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray                             photoelectron spectroscopy.  Mechanistic insights into the                      HDS reaction garnered from these studies will be used as                        the basis for a model of this important catalytic process.",
