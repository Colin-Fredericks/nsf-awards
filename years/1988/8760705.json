 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a definite need in crop improvement for a method to isolate        plant genes which relies primarily on phenotypes.  The idea of using            plant transposons in such a strategy is attractive but its efficient            implementation awaits a detailed investigation into factors which might         influence transposition frequency.  The corn transposon Ac (Activator),         which has been used in gene isolation in corn, is known to transpose in         tobacco, but existing systems for monitoring the activity of the                transposon are limited by the absence of any phenotype which can be             easily scored in whole plants.  This poses problems in assessing the            effectiveness of systems for gene isolation based on transposon                 mutagenesis.  Dr. Jones has engineered a useful visual assay for Ac             transposition is seedlings based on scoring somatic excisions from a            streptomycin resistance gene.  He proposes to carry out further studies         on genetic and other factors which might influence transposition                frequency in dicots in order to refine plant transposon technology so           that it can effectively be used for gene isolation in this group of             plants.                                                                             The development of this transposon technology will enable the               isolation of plant genes which could not easily be isolated by other            means.",
