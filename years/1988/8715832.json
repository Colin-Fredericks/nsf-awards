 "awd_abstract_narration": "Uncoupling of the calcium transporting ATPase of                        sarcoplasmic reticulum by removal of the catalytic metal ion                    will be characterized further.  The metal ion specificity and                   rate and equilibrium constants for development and                              disappearance of the uncoupling will be determined.  The steps                  involving the binding and release of calcuim at the low                         affinity site will be measured directly to determine the                        mechanism and thermodynamics of these steps.  Structure-                        reactivity correlations for nucleophilic reagents with                          phosphorylated pyridines will be done in order to determine if                  there is a metaphosphate intermediate in catalysis.  Although                   an enormous amount of work has been carried out on chemical                     reactions that generate carbocations a limited amount of work                   has probed these indirectly by trapping reactions.  This will                   be done.  The substitution reactions at carbon will be                          investigated as will the ionization of thiamine.                                        A mechanistic understanding of vectorial processes in                   biology is being established with this work.  Knowledge of the                  basis the efficiency of catalytic processes in living systems                   is of great importance for fundamental work and for                             applications.  The most rational approach to genetic                            engineering requires information at the level of mechanistic                    detail that this work provides",
