Eight                        awardees will come from a wide range of scientific fields and                   will work with counterparts who are known scientists in India.                  Funds from this grant are used for travel, and research costs of                the scholars, and to partially pay for the stipends of the                      awardees.  U.S. $15,000 will be used to cover administrative                    costs in the U.S.  The ACC nominees for 1988-1989 are in various                social science fields as well as chemistry, chemical                            engineering, mathematics and physiology.  The specific topics                   they propose to work on are generally of considerable interest                  to NSF.                                                                                                                                                         Scope:  The ACC, the agent for the Indo-U.S. Subcommission on                   Education and Culture, is a highly regarded organization funding                opportunities for collaboration with Indian scholars in                         scientific areas of interest to NSF and to India.  It secures                   necessary clearances for the awardees in India and provides                     logistical and administrative support.  NSF makes the final                     ranking of potential awardees from the ACC nominees.  Past                      awardees have been productive with considerable publications in                 refereed journals.                                                                                                                                              The project is to be funded over two years.                                                                                                                     FY 88  U.S. $15,000 plus $219,268 in Indian currency                            FY 89  U.S. $15,000 plus $219,268 in Indian currency",
