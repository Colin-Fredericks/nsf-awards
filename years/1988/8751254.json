 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will improve the science education of students in the Richland     County schools, South Carolina by enhancing the science background and          teaching strategies of 5th and 6th grade teachers.  Thirty teachers will        participate in a two year program involving 2 five week summer workshops and    intensive activity and follow-up during the ensuing academic years.  The        summer workshops will emphasize science and mathematics content, teaching       techniques and laboratory skills.                                                                                                                               Participant teachers will develop and implement \"hands-on\" science units        within their classrooms and provide inservice programs for their peers.  The    administration of the schools has guaranteed support for both materials         acquisition and the remuneration of teachers for conducting inservice           programs.  The participating teachers will have access to students during the   summer to field test the units being developed.  The Lawrence Livermore         National Laboratory will provide materials and consultant service to the        project teachers.  A unique aspect of this program is the involvement of        parents and sharing the goals and objectives of the program with them.                                                                                          This proposal is deserving of funding since it focuses on science and           mathematics at the upper elementary level, serves an underrepresented           population, provides excellent followup activities to the participating         teachers, and involves a commitment of the school districts being served.",
