It will develop the                          methodology for a potentially very general route into                           polycyclic structures.  These are found in many of the complex                  molecules used in modern medicine and agriculture.                                                                                                              This research will develop the manganese (III) based oxidative                  free radical cyclization into a reliable and versatile method                   for the synthesis of highly functionalized cyclic and                           polycyclic compounds.  The research program will focus on the                   following questions:  (1) the scope of initiating groups;  (2)                  the type of double bond substitution patterns that can be                       tolerated and whether endocyclic or exocyclic radicals are                      formed;  (3) the ring sizes that can be formed; (4) the                         functional groups that can be tolerated on the double bond; (5)                 the functional groups that can be tolerated elsewhere in the                    molecule;  (6) the scope of the aromatization reaction;  (7)                    the effect of additives on the nature of the reaction;  (8)                     the scope and limitations of the oxidative termination with                     Mn(OAc)3.2H2O and/or Cu(OAc)2.H2O, LiCl and LiX; and (9) the                    scope and limitations for the formation of a second or third                    ring.",
