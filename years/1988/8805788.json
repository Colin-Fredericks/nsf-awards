 "awd_abstract_narration": "The perfluorinated oxyanion ligands oxopentafluorotellurate(VI)                 and perfluorotertiarybutoxide will be used to prepare new                       classes of very reactive compounds of transition metal and                      lanthanide ions. These compounds are expected to have the                       highest reactivity (Lewis acidity) possible in a given solvent,                 due to solvent molecules in the coordination sphere of the                      metal ion. Efforts will focus on solvents which are extremely                   weak donors, such as arene hydrocarbons and chlorocarbons, so                   that compounds containing coordinated solvent molecules as                      extremely easily replaced ligands will be formed. Extremely                     bulky anions which have the potential for being the least                       coordinating anion, such as                                                     tetrakis(oxopentafluorotellurate(VI))borate, will be                            synthesized, and their reactions with solvated metal ions will                  be studied in the weakly coordinating solvents mentioned above.                 The enhanced chemical reactivity of metal ion complexes of                      these weakly coordinating solvents and ligands will be applied                  to selective oxidation of organic substrates, the generation of                 unusual high oxidation states of metal ions, such as Cu(III)                    and Fe(IV), and the study of naked metal and non-metal cations                  in solution.                                                                                                                                                    The results of this project may provide a new method of                         controlling the reactivity of metal ions in solutions.",
