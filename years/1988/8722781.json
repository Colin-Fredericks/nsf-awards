 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collabortive research between Dr. Felix F.              Wu, Electronics Research Laboratory, University of California,                  Berkeley and Professor Brian J. Cory, Department of Electrical                  Engineering, Imperial College of Science and Technology, London.                The objective of the research is to develop a set of indices for                dynamic security assessment in power system operational planning.               The main concern in dynamic security assessment is the ability of               the system to remain stable after a major disturbance, such as                  transmission line outage due to lightning or generator outage.  The             research will be based on the theoretical work on exact                         characterization of stability regions developed at the University of            California, Berkeley and the expertise in operational planning at               the Imperial College.  The interactive graphics facility for power              system simulation developed by Imperial College will be used as an              essential tool in the development of dynamic security indices.  The             research results can be utilized to set more realistic power                    transfer capabilities in a transmission network, thus allowing more             power to be transferred between regions and reducing the overall                production costs of the system.                                                                                                                                 The Energy and Power Systems Group at Imperial College is one of the            largest research groups in the power systems field in the U.K.  The             group has considerable expertise, especially in power system                    operational planning.  Both the U.S. investigator Dr. Wu and his                British collaborator Dr. Brian Cony are internationally recognized              experts on the topic of the proposed research.",
