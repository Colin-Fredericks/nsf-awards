 "awd_abstract_narration": "The role of urea in soybean nitrogen metabolism will be                         examined by comparing normal plants and mutant plants lacking                   one or both urease isozymes, namely the abundant embryo-                        specific urease and the ubiquitous urease.  The former                          isozyme is synthesized exclusively in the developing embryo                     while the latter is found in all soybean tissues examined.                      While urease-negative plants are viable they exhibit leaf-tip                   necrosis associated with urea buildup.  This project examines                   the sources of the urea and the effects of blocking urea                        assimilation on soybean yield.  Radiolabeled urea                               accumulation from guanido-labelled arginine and from                            allantoin will be measured.  The effects of the urease blocks                   on assimilation of ureides (allantoin and allantoic acid) and                   of arginine in cultured cells and in hydroponic plants will                     be studied.  Field trials of urease-negative plants will                        assess protein and seed yield.                                                                                                                                  In addition to the urease mutants already in hand, new                          mutants will be screened for lacking arginase and                               allantoinase.  Upon determining the tissue specificity, it                      will be determined if these mutational blocks prevent urea                      accumulation in the affected tissues in urease-negative                         backgrounds and whether they affect arginine and ureide                         assimilation, respectively.%%%                                                                                                                                  These studies will add to our knowledge of the metabolism of                    ureides and arginine in soybean.  The former are an important                   transport form of fixed nitrogen while the latter likely has                    a nitrogen storage role in addition to its role as a                            polyamine precursor.***//",
