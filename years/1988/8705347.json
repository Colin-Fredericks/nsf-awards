 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Whitham of Northern Arizona State University will                   continue a study of pinyon pine, Pinus edulis, which grows on the               ash and cinder fields of Northern Arizona's Sunset Crater.  The                 pine is water and nutrient stressed, and although adjacent sites                suffer little herbivory, stressed pinyons suffer many-fold                      increases in attack by 3 insect herbivores.  This chronic and                   acute herbivory results in a herbivore-mediated sex change in the               tree, altered tree architecture and greatly reduced growth.  Five               basic lines of research will be continued:  1. experimentally                   manipulate stress and herbivore loads to separate cause and                     effect, 2. quantify the chemical and/or genetic basis of                        resistance, 3. quantify the impacts of insect herbivory on the                  host's root, crown, and reproductive systems, 4. quantify the                   impacts of host resistance on herbivore survival and seed                       dispersal, and 5. reconstruct the past 200 years of chronic                     insect attack.  With the multidisciplinary skills of 6                          researchers, rapid progress has been made in examining these                    questions by employing insect transfer experiments, tree                        transplant experiments, supplemental water and fertilizing                      experiments, primary and secondary plant biochemistry,                          dendrochronology, and electrophoresis.  Because of the extremes                 of environmental conditions encountered, the obvious impacts of                 herbivory on these plants and our ability to experimentally                     manipulate the major components, the system represents a model                  for integrating major factors in plant-herbivore interactions.",
