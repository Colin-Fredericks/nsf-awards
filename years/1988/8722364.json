 "awd_abstract_narration": "The High-Tc Superconductivity Information Exchange has been                   designated by the President as the national Superconductivity                   Research Basic Scientific Information Center.  It provides a                    centralized site for quickly disseminating up-to-date information               to researchers in the rapidly evolving field of high-temperature                superconductivity.  The project's goal is to enable US scientists               to keep abreast of what other researchers here and abroad are                   doing and to provide a coordinated communications network for the               high-Tc research community.                                                       The Information Exchange has two parts:  the High-Tc Update,                  which is published twice a month, and the information                           clearinghouse.  The twice-monthly High-Tc Update is available as                hard copy and as electronic mail (e-mail). The complete, hard-                  copy newsletter includes preprint lists, high-Tc news, meeting                  summaries, coming events, resources, funding information.  The                  shorter, e-mail version consists of the preprint lists only.                    E-mail is also used to send high-Tc news flashes and important,                 last-minute announcements.                                                        Clearinghouse activities include responding to individual                     inquiries and providing basic scientific information upon                       request.  Research news spreads rapidly in this volatile field,                 and scientists, the media, and industry contact the Information                 Exchange for up-to-date, reliable information.",
