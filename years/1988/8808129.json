 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evaluating the behavioral effects of drug administration is                often a very subjective event depending on the animals being                    tested and the behaviors being observed.  Dr. Patrick Randall is                concerned with evaluating a variety of mathematical models                      concerning the relationship between the dose of drug that is                    administered to an animal, receptor occupancy, and behavioral                   responses to drug administration.  Much of the current behavioral               research in pharmacology does not benefit from the more                         sophisticated pharmacological techniques that can be used for the               analysis of neuropharmacological data.  The work to be performed                will attempt to validate some of these techniques in a                          dopaminergic system, and to use these approaches to characterize                the receptor subtypes that are involved in specific behavioral                  responses to dopamine agonists and/or antagonists.  By                          demonstrating the feasibility of this mathematical approach and                 perhaps by developing computer programs by which such data can be               readily analyzed it is likely that Dr. Randall will provide means               by which other behavioral pharmacologists will be able to conduct               and analyze experiments with a considerably greater degree of                   sophistication.",
