The meeting which is organized by          the Tata Energy Research Institute (TERI) in New Delhi and a U.S. team          headed by Dr. Ralph Mott of North Carolina State University will cover          the relatively specific aspects of biotechnology and genetic                    engineering that are more usable in forestry application.  These                include tissue culture techniques and genetic manipulation of woody             plants, as well as study of the drawbacks to nitrogen fixation                  application in forestry.  The workshop is designed to articulate the            issues of transfer of scientific developments in biotechnology to field         implementation programs, to identify specific gaps in the literature in         this field and to compile recent contributions to fill this gap, and to         identify specific research needs for possible collaboration.                                                                                                    Scope:  This project fits well the objectives of the U.S.-India program         in its dealing with an area of science that is of great interest to             U.S. and to Indian scientists and where the cooperating scientists are          leaders in the field.  The Indian institution TERI is a relatively new          private research organization with extensive ongoing research programs          in areas of energy including heavy emphasis on forestry and biomass.            It has a large well trained staff most of whom have extensive research          background in biotechnology.  The U.S. scientists are active                    researchers in the field of biological sciences and its application to          forestry.  The meeting is likely to stimulate strong collaborative              research.",
