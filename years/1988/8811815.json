 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design and analysis of a cache coherence system for hierarchical            bus-based shared-memory multiprocessors is being carried out.  The bus          protocol is compatible with the Futurebus IEEE896 specifications and            can be easily utilized in the next generation of general purpose bus-           based shared-memory multiprocessors.  The goals of the design are on            low memory access time, low bus utilization, and cost effective                 hardware.                                                                                                                                                       The stochastic colored Petri net simulation software developed can be           utilized as a powerful simulation technique in the analysis of many             other concurrent computer systems.  The concurrent software developed           can alleviate the problems of simulations on a sequential computer.             The principal investigator is a new Ph.D. who already has significant           progress in his research.  The research focuses on important and timely         topics.  Support is highly recommended.",
