 "awd_abstract_narration": "To provide students with experimental knowledge of key aspects of          cellular structure and function, this department is adding laboratory           exercises to its cellular and molecular biology programs.  Laboratory           work is being provided for the first time in conjunction with Molecular         Genetics; a project in molecular genetics is being added to Micro-              biology; improved experiments in cellular biochemistry, respiration,            and photosynthesis are being introduced into the Cellular Physiology            and Biochemistry laboratories.                                                                                                                                       These laboratory improvements required the new equipment that is           being provided through this project.  The equipment includes:  gel              electrophoresis and blotting equipment, a sequencing gel reader, two            centrifuges, a refrigerator, a -70*C freezer, water baths, a gel                photographic unit, an analytical balance, a table-top autoclave, an             orbital platform shaker for gel staining procedures, a microprocessor-          controlled UV-visible spectrophotometer, a tissue homogenizer, and              oxygen-monitoring systems.                                                                                                                                           With this equipment, students can do investigations in areas               previously studied only through lectures and reading.  The combination          of theoretical and experimental understanding of cellular biology made          possible by the new laboratory activities provides preparation                  essential to their pursuit of advanced degrees and careers in the life          sciences.  The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an            equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
