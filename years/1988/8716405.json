 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fish collection of the School of Fisheries of the                      University of Washington consists of over 200,000 specimens and                 constitutes the only repository in the country with archival                    storage of North Pacific and Bering Sea fishes.  The University                 has pledged its sustained support in maintaining this nationally                important collection at a high level of activity.  The                          University's long-term commitment is evidenced by its plans to                  provide in excess of $1.4 million over the next six years for new               facilities to house the collection.  NSF support through this                   award will augment the University's funds by supporting a                       collection manager for three years, providing one-half of the                   cost of a compactorized shelving system for the specimens, and                  facilitating a computerized catalog for the collection.  At the                 end of the three-year grant period, the University will assusme                 the cost of the collection manager's salary, and it also will                   provide the remaining half of the compactorized shelving.",
