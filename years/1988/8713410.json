 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many natural and man-made media such as the atmosphere, the ocean,              geophysical media, biological media, and composite and disordered               materials have spatial or temporal random variations.  The interaction          of optical, electromagnetic, or acoustic waves with these random media          greatly affects communication through the medium, as well as                    identification and imaging of the target in the medium, and                     determination of the medium characteristics.  Although considerable             progress has been reported on the interaction of waves with random              media, several outstanding problems have emerged which are expected to          lead to important engineering and scientific advances.  Recent studies          on the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) of random media when                  combined with inverse scattering studies should lead to the                     improvement of image resolution and identification through practical            media as well as the advance of the multiple scattering theory.  The            study of backscattering enhancement from disordered media and rough             surfaces has attracted considerable attention from those involved in            localization phenomena and may help clarify these new physical                  phenomena.  Continued work on the utilization of the complete                   statistical and polarization information of waves should lead to a new          imaging technique and graphic display of the medium and target.  An             extension of the studies on rough surface scattering to very rough              surfaces and backscattering enhancement encompasses fundamental                 research as well as practical applications and should lead to the               construction of improved or new statistical wave theories and                   applications.",
