 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is providing electrophoretic and immunochemistry              equipment for use by undergraduate students enrolled in the                     Biochemistry and Molecular Biology courses.  The equipment is being             used to educate students in both the theory and the practice of modern          techniques used to separate and analyze proteins and nucleic acids from         biological sources.  The new instrumentation includes a video                   densitometer, an ELISA reader, eight electrophoresis set-ups, computer          interfaces and software.                                                                                                                                             A sound set of educational and scientific goals is being pursued           systematically under this project.  The approach being employed                 stresses the quantitative uses of electrophoretic and immunochemical            methods for detecting molecules (using modern densitometry and                  absorbance measurements), along with more traditional approaches.               Under the resulting program students now are receiving the hands-on             laboratory experience necessary to prepare them for scientific careers          in biotechnology, the health professions, industry, and research.                                                                                                    The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
