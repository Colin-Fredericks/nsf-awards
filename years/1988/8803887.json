 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is for an Research Experiences For Undergraduates               site for 4 students at Moravian College during the summer.  The                 project will offer the undergraduates an opportunity for                        mathematical study and research by providing them a graduate                    school type experience.  The Principal Investigator will                        supervise a seminar throughout the entire eight weeks of the                    program.  Initially the seminar will introduce necessary                        background material, and gradually the students will become                     actively involved in the seminar, giving talks on outside                       readings as well as doing their own research.  The student                      research projects have been chosen so that they are accessible to               undergraduates.  The main focus of the project is in the area of                explicit reciprocity laws in algebraic number theory.  Each                     student's research topic will relate to this central problem but                focus on a particular aspect which may be chosen from one of the                following: finite fields, polynomials and algebraic functions in                one variable over finite fields, reciprocity maps, and explicit                 factorization of certain polynomials.",
