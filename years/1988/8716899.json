 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Dickman proposes Monte Carlo studies of linear polymers on                  two and three dimensional lattices.  Various equations of state                 for polymers - Flory and Flory-Huggins mean-field theories, as                  well as the predictions of renormalization group methods - have                 yet to be subjected to a definitive test.  It is proposed that                  these theories be compared against the results of Monte Carlo                   simulations of a particularly simple model:  athermal chains on a               lattice.  The simulations are to extend over a wide range of                    densities, and to rather long chains, and should be performed in                both two and three dimensions.  Such studies are rendered                       feasible by a new method in which the pressure is related to the                segment density at a wall.  It is therefore natural to                          investigate wall-polymer interactions in the course of the                      simulations.  The studies should also yield information on                      correlations and on the variation of chain conformational                       properties with density.",
