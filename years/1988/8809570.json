 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is focused on building a theoretical foundation             for machine learning.  In this theory, it can be shown whether or not           learning is feasible in given situations, the nature of the                     resources required, and the possibility of extending learning                   algorithms successfully from one situation to another.  The main                approach is based on reductions - relationships between learning                problems and better understood combinatorial optimization problems.                   The importance of this research is that programs which learn -            improve their performance by experience, without explicit                       programming - will be a central part of future computer systems.  In            order to shed light on the many possible approaches to machine                  learning, it is vital to build theoretical foundations, describing              what is learnable in theory and what is not, within practical                   limitations of time and resources.  This award is being funded as               one of the 1988 Research Initiation Awards for outstanding new                  investigators in the Computer and Information Science and                       Engineering (CISE) Directorate.",
