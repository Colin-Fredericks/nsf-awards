 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigator will conduct empirical and theoretical research               on memory for information about people and the construction of                  social categories.  The first set of studies surveys the                        functions that memory serves in everyday social life and explores               the contents and organization of peoples' memories for their                    acquaintances and for public figures they \"meet\" through public                 media.  Two primary questions motivate the research plan:  How                  does function determine memory contents and structure?  Do                      memories of emotion-provoking individuals differ from those of                  neutral, non-evocative individuals?  A second set of studies                    occurs in controlled, laboratory \"get acquainted\" tasks and is                  designed to study the effects of social goals on subjects\"                      memories of other people they encounter in laboratory                           interactions.  The primary motivation underlying these studies is               to test the generality of results from previous laboratory person               memory research in social interactions with actual people.  A                   third set of studies is concerned with a separate topic, the                    creation of conjunction categories for novel social groups (e.g.,               male nurses, female mechanics, etc.).  The guiding question here                concerns the development of a theory to predict the manner in                   which two \"ingredient\" categories will be combined to yield a new               conjunction category.                                                                                                                                           The Principal Investigator is well known as a strong and                        productive scholar.",
