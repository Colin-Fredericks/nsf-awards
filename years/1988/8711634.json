 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal objective of the research is an improved understanding            of the Bloch wall structure and substructure associated with magnetic           bubble domains with major emphasis on dynamic effects which occur only          when the walls are inm motion.  Through a cooperative effort with               Magnesys, a Bubble Memory Systems Company, this research effort will            be integrated with their plans to achieve gigabit vertical Bloch line           memory systems in the next decade.                                                                                                                              The study of wall dynamics will be carried out on (111) and (110)-              oriented magnetic garnets as have been used, or proposed for use in             bubble and Bloch line magnetic memories.  Dynamic observations will be          carried out on wall structures in bubbles which are in steady motion,           achieved when a bubble moves in a uniform circular path under the               influence of applied field gradients.  These field gradients are                produced by suitable conductor patterns, readily made in our                    laboratories.  This experimental technique, developed at Purdue                 University, provides a unique method to determine details of the                dynamical domain wall structure such as the number and sign of                  vertical Bloch lines.",
