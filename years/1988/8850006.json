 "awd_abstract_narration": "A eight week field-oriented geology course will be implemented for 16           high school students, based at Colorado College in Colorado Springs.            The course will teach students to apply scientific principles to                actual geological problems in a stimulating outdoor environment,                emphasizing the approach and methods a professional geologist would             use. Hands-on experiential learning in classical geological areas of            the west replace classroom lectures and labs.  More than 80% of class           time will be spent in the field.  Cognate sciences will be employed to          demonstrate the interdisciplinary nature of geology and promote further         interest in their pursuit.  Students will learn to make informed,               reasoned, ethical judgement about environmental and resource issues.            Tours of government and industry facilities will expose students to             career choices and employment opportunities in the sciences.  The               intensive, yet informal nature of the course fosters professional               interchange of ideas, which will be presented orally and in written             reports.  The staff are all experienced filed geologists with                   backgrounds in the liberal arts approach to learning.  Outstanding              women and minority paraprofessionals have been chosen to encourage              mentoring with leaders underrepresented in the field.",
