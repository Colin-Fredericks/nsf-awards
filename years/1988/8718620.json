 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this proposal is to test definitively                     the hypothesis that mating type (mt) determination in the                       unicellular eukaryote Tetrahymena thermophila is due to DNA                     alterations.  The basic idea is to microinject DNA from cells                   of one mating type into cells of different mt, in order to                      induce the recipient to change mt.  Our experimental design                     is directed toward cloning, as a cosmid insert, the DNA                         segment responsible for this mating type switch, presumably                     the mtd locus.  This in turn will allow us to determine a)                      whether mating type determination occurs via                                    \"deletion/splicing\", or \"cassette\" transposition, or                            something else, and b) whether the mtd locus is likely to                       contain the structural genes(s)  for the molecules                              responsible for the mt-specific cell/cell interactions, or                      rather to be a regulator of the expression of those genes.                      The ultimate aim is to provide a detailed genetic and                           molecular description of the mechanism of mating type                           determination in T. thermophila.                                                                                                                                Thermophila is a unicellular eukaryotic cell which contains                     two nuclei, the micronucleus or germ line nucleus and the                       macronucleus or the somatic nucleus which contains the                          expressing genome.  The micronucleus carries genes encoding                     seven different mating types which have the potential for                       expression, yet only one of those types is actually expressed                   by the macronucleur genome during the vegetative lifetime of                    the cell.  The successful completion of this work will give                     greater insight into how genome expression is regulated in a                    \"simple\" eukaryotic cell.",
