 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the organization and ceremonial use of                    space within a Middle Woodland enclosure in order to document                   the presence of activity areas and develop rigorous sequences                   of architectural development.  The student will excavate a                      circular enclosure at Pinson Mounds Site, in western Tennessee.                 This is one of the largest Middle Woodland earthwork centers.                                                                                                   Since the beginning of archaeological inquiries about                           prehistoric remains in the eastern United States, scholars have                 sought to assign earthen enclosures to the religious and                        ceremonial realm of culture.  Recently, scholars have suggested                 that enclosures were major foci for inter- and intra-group                      interaction.  This proposal will test these two models in order                 to discover how Middle Woodland groups planned and structured                   enclosures and used space.                                                                                                                                      This research will extend our knowledge about the cultural                      occupation in Middle Woodland sites and help test models of                     group interaction patterns.  It will also provide new                           information about the use of space in tribal societies and                      architecture's relation to social dynamics.",
