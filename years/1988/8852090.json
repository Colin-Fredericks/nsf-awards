 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Biological Sciences is committed to teaching             students an understanding of biology through participation in                   scientific experimentation.  In addition to a better understanding of           science, participation in the process of science teaches students               valuable skills for today's job market.  To meet the increased need for         graduates who can bring an understanding of immunology to their                 advanced studies as well as Minnesota's growing biotechnology industry,         the Biology department currently is updating and expanding this area of         its curriculum.  This is being achieved by hiring a new faculty member          with up-to-date knowledge in immunology and purchasing an initial suite         of equipment.                                                                                                                                                        The goal of this project is to complement the original equipment           purchases with items commonly used in modern immunological technology.          This allows the Department to offer a program in immunology that aids           students in their understanding of biology and also prepares them for           employment opportunities in local industry.                                                                                                                          The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal            sum obtained from non-Federal sources.",
