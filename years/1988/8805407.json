 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to establish an Research Experiences For                     Undergraduates site at Texas Southern University for 10 students.               The project will center around finite difference equations.  The                students will participate in a course in finite difference                      equations and an informal research class in which published                     papers will be read, analyzed and explained in detail.  There                   will also be a series of colloquia with guest presenters.  The                  participants will be required to attend these courses, prepare a                presentation to be given at the end of the summer component and                 prepare a manuscript to submit to the Journal of Undergraduate                  Mathematics.                                                                         This award is to a minority institution and the program is                 designed to increase minority participation in mathematical                     research.  The department is very experienced in teaching                       minorities and currently has graduates attending several large                  universities working on advanced degrees in mathematics.",
