 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Aigner and her colleagues will combine archaeological                       excavation with analysis of historical documents to reconstruct                 pre- and protohistoric Aleut social organization and determine                  how this changed over time.  They will excavate two sites located               on Unalaska Island in the Aleutian archipelago.  The older of the               two, the McLees Lake site, contains a number of individual                      household dwellings.  The more recent Reese Bay site preserves                  two multihousehold longhouses.  Large areas of both sites will be               stripped and house boundaries and inner partitions mapped.                      Cultural and faunal remains will be collected, analyzed, and                    dated.                                                                                                                                                          The goal of the research is to trace the development of social                  complexity among Aleut hunters and gatherers in the Aleutian                    Islands.  Both archaeological and ethnohistoric information                     suggest that in prehistoric times Aleut society changed from a                  relatively egalitarian form of organization to a more complex                   form characterized by a social and political hierarchy.  Dr.                    Aigner postulates that the McLees Lake and Reese Bay sites                      represent earlier and later phases of this process.  Through                    spatial analysis of house forms and burial and material remains,                one can determine the extent of hierarchical organization.                      Unequal distribution of living space and an association of high                 prestige items with specific burials or living areas indicate                   social inequality.                                                                                                                                              This research is important for several reasons.  Many                           anthropologists believe that growth of social complexity is a                   byproduct to the Neolithic revolution and that it was the                       domestication of plants and animals which began the process which               resulted societies as we know them today.  Others argue that                    complexity can develop in groups which subsist by hunting and                   gathering, and this research will directly address this issue.                  Secondly, in the passage of the Arctic Research Act, the U.S.                   Congress has recognized the importance of a broad program of                    Arctic research.  Dr. Aigner's project will help to further this                goal.",
