 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Florida State Museum, located on the University of                     Florida campus in Gainesville, contains the largest collection of               fossil invertebrates in the southeast.  Most of these specimens                 were collected from highly fossiliferous strata that occur                      throughout the state.  The remainder derive principally from                    sites around the Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plain and the circum-                Caribbean.  The fossil invertebrates provide us with a unique                   opportunity to understand the environmental conditions which                    existed in this part of the world throughout the Cenozoic Era                   (last 65 million years of Earth history) and to appreciate the                  substantial biological changes which have occurred.                                  Over the last decade, the collection has suffered without a                curator or collection manager.  Nevertheless, private donations                 of fossils continued to pour in while faculty and students at the               University of Florida deposited considerable amounts of fossil                  materials from their research efforts.  This combination of                     events resulted in a tremendous backlog of uncurated and                        uncatalogued specimens.  Therefore, one of the most important                   tasks facing the newly hired staff of the invertebrate                          paleontology division is to reduce the large curatorial backlog.                This project provides funds to attack this problem.                                  The goals of the project involve substantially reducing the                curation backlog by preparing and cataloguing several thousand of               the most important specimen lots, computerizing the entire                      catalogued collection, and preparing an up-dated type catalogue                 and summary of holdings.  Attainment of these goals will affect                 dramatically the significance of the collection and its value as                a national research resource.  Computerization will allow                       scientists to search and scan the data files quickly and to                     perform complex sorts for the information they desire.                          Publication of a type catalogue and summary of holdings will help               familiarize the scientific community with the resources in the                  collection.  When the contents and organization of the                          invertebrate paleontology collection are publicized, many more                  earth scientists will be able to take advantage of the extensive                amount of unique material contained therein.",
