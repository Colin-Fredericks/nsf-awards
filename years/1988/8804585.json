 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research                   Equipment for the Mathematical Sciences program of the Division                 of Mathematical Sciences. It is for the purchase of special                     purpose equipment dedicated to the support of research in the                   mathematical sciences.  In general, this equipment is required by               several research projects, and would be difficult to justify for                one project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation                is coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers,                 and with substantial cost-sharing from the institution submitting               the proposal.  This is an instance of university, industrial, and               government cooperation in the support of basic research in the                  mathematical sciences.                                                               The equipment in this project will be used by the Department               of Mathematical Sciences at Northern Illinois University to                     support research in four projects: A Study of Free Objects in                   Varieties of Semigroups; A Variety of Problems in Computational                 and Combinatorial Number Theory; The Implementation and Analysis                of Superfast Toeplitz Solvers; and Empirical Investigations of                  Weighted Least Squares Statistics for testing Log-linear                        Hypotheses in Categorical Data.",
