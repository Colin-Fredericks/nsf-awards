 "awd_abstract_narration": "This prototype project includes several activities to strengthen                minority education from junior high school through the baccalaureate            degree. It was developed as a cooperative effort among a number of              colleges and universities, school districts, educational support                organizations, community groups, unions, and corporations in the                Philadelphia area. During the first year of operation, a set of                 activities, based on science and mathematics experiences, and designed          to nurture, encourage and motivate minority students, are being                 implemented. These include an intensive faculty mentoring program to            encourage community college minority students to continue on to the             baccalaureate degree. These mentors provide career information, plan            and supervise field trips, arrange visits to scientists and engineers           in their work places, integrate students into support services and              tutoring, and advise students about their course of study. Additional           mentoring is provided by minority student support groups that will              provide volunteer minority tutors and organize talks by minority                scientists. Undergraduate research experience is provided through               targeting selected community college students in their sophomore year.          Precollege student activities from junior high through high school              center around enrichment programs including special workshops in                mathematics, science, and communication. To augment these activities            each student's school is matched with an industry and/or government             agency to provide invaluable resources such as role models,                     demonstrations, speakers, field trips, etc.",
