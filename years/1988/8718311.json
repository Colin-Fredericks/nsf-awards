 "awd_abstract_narration": "Genetic and biochemical studies have shown that specific sites in               bacterial and bacteriophage DNA encode signals for transcription                termination.  These sites have been found at the ends of genes,                 between cistrons within an operon and even within gene coding                   regions of operons.  It has also become clear that transcription                terminators play an important regulatory role in gene expression.               One objective of this research is to gain an understanding of the               molecular events involved in transcription termination at the                   attenuator site in the threonine (thr) operon of Escherichia                    coli.  A systematic analysis will be undertaken of the sequence                 and structural features of the attenuator that are necessary for                transcription termination.  A second objective of this study is                 to examine transcriptional pausing at the pause site in the thr                 regulatory region and at the attenuator.  Variations of the                     standard footprinting technique will be used to probe both RNA                  and DNA in paused complexes.  A third objective of this work is                 to examine the stability of the secondary RNA structures encoded                by wild-type and mutant attenuators.  It has been proposed that                 the stability of the secondary RNA structure is important for                   transcription termination.  RNA will be isolated in quantities                  sufficient to measure thermal denaturation profiles.  This will                 permit comparison of observed and calculated Tm values.  It will                also be be possible to determine if the stability of secondary                  RNA structure is proportional to termination efficiency.  The                   last objective of the proposal is to isolate and map mutations in               genes that encode proteins that participate in transcription                    termination in vivo.  Mutants will be isolated that increase                    transcriptional readthrough at rho-independent terminators.                     Characterization of these mutants will provide information on                   which gene products are involved in transcription termination in                vivo.",
