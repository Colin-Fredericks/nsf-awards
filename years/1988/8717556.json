 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program is in the area of transition metal chemistry.                 The project is concerned with reactions in which atoms of two                   different metals are exchanged between carrier molecules to                     which they are attached, so-called transmetalation reactions.                   Of particular interest are reactions involving polymetallic                     species, species which contain several metal atoms within one                   molecule. One aim of the project is to use transmetalation                      reactions to synthesize polymetallic species containing atoms                   of two or more different metals within one molecule. Such                       mixed-metal polymetallic species are expected to have                           interesting catalytic properties and also are models of                         important enzymes, such as the respiratory enzyme cytochrome                    oxidase. It may be possible also to decompose the mixed-metal                   species to yield alloys of types which cannot be made directly                  from the constituent metals.                                                                                                                                    The focus of the project will be the newly discovered                           phenomenon of transmetalation which leads to quantitative,                      stepwise replacement of metal centers in polymetallic targets                   by other metals from simple molecular transmetalators. The                      reactions proceed under mild conditions and the products are                    easily separated. The major components of the research will be:                 1) isolation, structural characterization and electrochemical                   studies of cationic targets and transmetalation products;                       2) investigation of earlier and heavier element transmetalation                 systems; 3) development and use of more economical                              transmetalators; 4) identification of reactions of linkage                      transmetalators which give large polymetallic molecules; 5)                     description of the selective ligand chemistry of                                heteropolymetallic molecules; 6) use of transmetalation to                      generate new bulk alloys and supported metal catalysts; and 7)                  development of heteropolyorganometallic chemistry.",
