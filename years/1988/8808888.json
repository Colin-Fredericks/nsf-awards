 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research is to obtain an improved                 understanding of the transport phenomena occurring during                       solidification of multicomponent mixtures.  The research is aimed at            investigating the effects of buoyancy and solid/liquid density                  difference driven flow in the liquid phase on the heat and mass                 transfer and solidification processes.  A consistent model that                 integrates the description of the transport phenomena occurring on a            macroscopic level, such as momentum, energy, and species transfer due           to convection and diffusion, as well as on a microscopic level, such            as nucleation, interfacial transfer, and growth of the microstructures          will be developed.  The theoretical work will be supplemented by a              comprehensive experimental program through which qualitative and                quantitative information about the relevant transport phenomena can be          obtained and which serves to validate the model predictions.                                                                                                    The results obtained through the proposed research will contribute to           improved understanding and control of a wide range of processes                 involving solidification and will lead to more realistic predictions            and optimization of material properties.  The work is pertinent to              ingot solidification, shape casting, directional solidification,                continuous casting, welding processes, rapid solidification,                    electroslag remelting, as well as coating, purification, crystal                growth and polymer production.",
