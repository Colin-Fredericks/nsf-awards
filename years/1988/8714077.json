 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Dr. John M. Cheeseman and an assistant from              the University of Illinois to collaborate with Dr. Barry F. Clough              of the Australian Institute of Marine Science in Townsville,                    Queensland, Australia.  During an 18-day field expedition, they will            collect data on the photosynthetic characteristics of three species             of mangroves that differ in their strategies of salinity tolerance.             For each species, light saturation, quantum efficiency, leaf water              potential and salt status will be determined for sun leaves at the              top of the canopy and for shade leaves within the canopy on trees               located along a natural salinity gradient.                                                                                                                      The purpose of this research is to gain insight into the                        photosynthetic characteristics and environmental responses which                allow mangroves to be the dominant plants in a highly stressful but             highly productive ecosystem.  The project will benefit from the                 complementary backgrounds of and instrumentation available to the               investigators.  Dr. Cheeseman's work has involved laboratory-based              studies on the physiology of salt tolerance in plants.  Dr. Clough              is an expert on mangrove physiology with extensive field                        experience.  The Australian Institute of Marine Science maintains a             permanent field site on the Daintree River which is appropriately               positioned for sampling across a natural salinity gradient.",
