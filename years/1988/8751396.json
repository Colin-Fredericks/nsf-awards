 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigation of naive conceptions of science has many implications         for both teaching and learning.  The predominant model for past                 investigations has been with school children or within very formal              settings.  Extending investigations of misconceptions to informal               settings is the challenge of this research.                                                                                                                     Museum visitors' misconceptions about two topics, gravity and mechanical        advantage, will be recorded through a variety of interview formats.             Twenty-five persons from each of the age ranges 9-11, 12-14, 15-18, and         college students/adults will be interviewed.  Information from the              interview will be used to modify the current exhibit or to build new            prototypes. The research will determine if a modification can be made           that results in individuals moving from their previous misconceptions           toward a correct conceptualization of the concepts. This research will          document what individuals actually learn from museum exhibits and how           \"front end evaluation\" can be used to redesign exhibits for maximum             concept learning.                                                                                                                                               The proposed research is challenging and has the potential of adding            significant information to science education research on misconceptions.        The principal investigator is highly respected in the field of museum           education and the associated staff and consultants are the top scholars         in their respective fields.",
