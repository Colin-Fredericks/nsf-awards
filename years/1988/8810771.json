 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to develop and experimentally validate a                     rule-based algorithm for the dynamics of mechanical part                        orienting and positioning operations found in such systems as                   manipulator pushing a part and parts-feeders.  The algorithm                    will serve as an analysis and design tool for these systems.                         The algorithm will consider the boundary representation of                 the parts and manipulator as an integral component of the                       system dynamics.  The kinematic constraint changes found                        in these systems can be algorithmically handled by the                          development of rules.  The dynamic equations of motion                          can be reformulated to provide a continuous simulation of the                   systems motion.  The motions required for a manipulator to push                 a part into a predescribed orientation will be planned with                     the aid of the algorithm and physically implemented.  The                       physical implementation of the planned manipulator pushing                      operations will be recorded with a spin physics 2,000 high speed                camera and compared to the simulated motion.                                         The significance of the research is two-fold.                              First, the research will develop a rule-based algorithm to                      simulate dynamic mechanical systems with changing kinematic                     constraints.  Second, it will obviate a present bottleneck to                   flexible manufacturing by developing a tool, which considers                    the dynamic inertial effects and changing kinematic                             constraints, to plan motion strategies for manipulator part                     orienting operations, and to design parts-feeders.",
