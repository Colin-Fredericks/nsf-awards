 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Black Sea is the only extant, relatively larger ocean               basin that contains a substantial volume of anaerobic deep                      water.  The sediments deposited in deeper water over perhaps                    the last 5-7 Ky are sapropelic to finely laminated and                          calcareous.  21-day leg of the R/V Knorr in the Black Sea in                    1988 will provide an examination of the geochemical record in                   sediments of the timing of initiation and expansion of deep                     water anoia.  This will be accomplished by an integrated study                  of box cores and large diameter gravity cores from as many as                   30 stations with extensive coverage of the basin deeps.                         Carefully collected  and preserved cores will provide a varve-                  calibrated timescale for the late Holocene Black Sea sequence                   using various photographic methods, NMRI (nuclear magnetic                      resonance imaging), microdensitometry, radiocarbon dating.                              The results will be synthesized, in cooperation with other              researchers, for interpretation of the imprint of anoxia on the                 sediment geochemical record and the changes in productivity and                 accumulation rates that accompanied climate and sea level                       changes; statistical treatment of varve records will yield                      patterns of quasi-cyclic variations on timescales of 1-1000                     years.  All such inferences are important for interpretation of                 ancient laminated, organic-carbon rich strata.",
