 "awd_abstract_narration": "This teacher enhancement project consists of three-full year cycles,            beginning with a summer workshop and followed by the school year. This          design gives the participants an opportunity to interact and learn the          biological concepts, processes and teaching methods, to share and work          together with outstanding life science teachers and to establish and            maintain a continuing collaborative partnership with scientists and             science educators from University of Texas at Austin.                                                                                                           Twenty-four of the less well-prepared middle/junior high school life            science teachers from the counties around the University will be                selected for each cycle. Twenty summer and seven fall sessions, a total         of 118 contact hours, will be required of participants for which they           will receive six semester hours of credit.  The summer sessions will            include laboratory and field experiences, content presentations by              scientists, and small group work periods during which lessons will be           prepared.  During the fall, in addition to working with the scientists,         the participants will prepare instructional units and special sessions          entitled \"Middle/Junior High School Kids Meet the Scientist\"  which will        be held in the participants' classrooms.  A series of visits by two             scientists to participants' classrooms will be made during the fall and         spring of each yearly cycle.                                                                                                                                    The participating school districts as well as other non-NSF sources are         contributing more than 30% of the cost of the project.",
