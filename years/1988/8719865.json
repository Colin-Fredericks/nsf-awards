 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will lead to the construction of a critically-               verified historical data base of snowfall, snow cover and snow                  water equivalent in the United States for the last 100 years                    using the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) archives.  The                   data base will be used to assess the capability of general                      circulation models in the simulation of snow cover and snow-                    climatic interactions and assess the utility of using snow                      records as indicators of climatic change.  The data base will be                assembled at NCDC by the principal investigator during the first                year of the project, and analyzed in cooperation with modelers                  during the second year.                                                                                                                                              This research is important because snow is a critical                      element of the earth's climate system.  Climate models and                      empirical studies suggest that snow anomalies are associated with               synoptic and long-term weather events and may play an important                 role in climate change.  However, there remain many unanswered                  questions regarding the variability of snow, the                                representativeness of short-term empirical studies and the                      accuracy of the modeling of snow-climate interactions which need                to be addressed with a long-term data base.",
