 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is an experimental study of predation on                     insect herbivores having different diet breadths.  The hypothesis               to be tested is that generalist herbivores are more efficiently                 found and/or utilized by  generalist predators than are                         specialist herbivores.  If so, predators can be expected to be a                selective force for the high degree of specialization seen in                   insect herbivores today.  The obvious importance of mortality due               to predation has not been extended to its influence on host                     range:  the chemical coevolutionary theories have been given                    precedence in spite of the growing controversy over some of the                 essential components of such theories.                                               There is some field evidence that predators restrict host                  range of herbivores, but direct comparison of relative predation                pressure on insects having different host-plant ranges requires                 experimental manipulation to control for confounding factors such               as initial differences in density.                                                   This project will experimentally test the hypothesis using                 an alfalfa system.  Five aphid species having different diet                    breadths will be tested.  They will be tested in pairs that are                 taxonomically as similar as possible but contrasting in normal                  host range.  Four generalist predators commonly in alfalfa fields               will be used to examine any differential utilization of prey.                   Results will address fundamental questions in community ecology                 and will be an applied interest for biocontrol of aphids.",
