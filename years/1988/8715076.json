 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research between Daniel Rock of                 the University of Nebraska and A.A. Schudel of the National                     Institute of Land and Cattle Technology in Buenos Aires,                        Argentina.  This research in molecular virology will characterize               the Bovine herpesvirus type-1 involved in infection of the bovine               central nervous system.  It will identify, through in-situ                      hybridization, regions of the viral genome that are                             transcriptionally active in the central nervous system neurons                  and identify and characterize specific latent infection-related                 viral genes within these regions.  This will lead to knowledge of               the interaction of an alpha herpesvirus with neural tissue during               latent infection in a natural host and development of strategies                for preventing latent infection or preventing its reactivation.                 Such knowledge is needed for the development of                                 genetically-engineered latency-negative vaccines.                                                                                                               This is an ambitious proposal but at modest cost.  It is an                     excellent example of the advantage of collaboration.  A unique                  well-characterized genetic strain of BHV-1 will be made available               by the Argentinians to the U.S. PI, whereas he will contribute                  the techniques and the methodology to be used in the research                   project.  While the practical purpose of studying a potential                   threat to the cattle industry is important to both countries, the               research has promise for understanding herpesvirus latency.",
