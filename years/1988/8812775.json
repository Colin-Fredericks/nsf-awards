 "awd_abstract_narration": "The process by which consumers make purchase timing decisions is                central to understanding a wide range of economic behaviors.  Although          this process may often be complex, at its center is a rather                    straightforward dilemma; how to balance the rewards of immediate                consumption with the risks of delayed regret.  The decision of when to          buy a major durable, for example, requires one to weigh the lure of             immediate enjoyment against the fear that a better product value may            become available later.  Likewise, the extent to which a consumer will          stock up on a discounted grocery item depends on how the rewards                associated with paying the lower-than-normal price are balanced against         the perceived likelihood that the apparent \"discount\" is, in fact, a            rather routine one.                                                                                                                                             This research will explore the process by which consumers make                  sequential purchase timing and quantity decisions in uncertain dynamic          environments.  Through the use of interactive computer experiments, the         research will explore the ability of consumers to form rationale                sequential buying strategies under variations in the pattern and                predictability of temporal price and product quality changes,                   uncertainty of future product demand, the risk and complexity of                decisions, and the cost of sequential information gathering.  The               research should identify sets of sequential decision heuristics which           will allow current formal                                                       behavioral theories of decision making under uncertainty to be                  extended to temporal domains.",
