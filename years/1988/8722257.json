 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on Decision Support Systems (DSS) involves the application of          information technology to organizational decision making.  It has               become clear that developments in information technology are not                matched by research on how the technology affects decision making and           the design of organizations.  This award provides partial support for a         collaborative research process which will identify the reference                disciplines of DSS and identify new research directions.  The process           will involve interdisciplinary groups whose task will be to highlight           important opportunities and problem areas involving the application of          information systems to the decision making process in organizations.            Specifically, the collaborative research groups will consider how               information technology can support group processes such as top                  management decision making and negotiation, how information technology          affects organizational boundaries, and how information technology can           be matched to the task, the organization and the user.  The results of          the collaborative research process will be presented in a national              conference and be will published in a book setting forth a                      interdisciplinary research agenda on decision support systems.",
