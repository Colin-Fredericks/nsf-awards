Many of the papers presented during the three-day               meeting will focus on Anglo-American relations in the history of                science and technology, although the meeting will include presentations         on a wide range of topics from the Renaissance to the present.  The             program, as currently taking shape, will feature 18 specially organized         morning sessions in which the papers will be precirculated to allow             for maximum discussion.  Afternoons will be devoted to a dozen or so            thematic sessions and various work-in-progress papers.  It is                   anticipated that at least 75 North Americans will be on the program             (with an equal number representing the BSHS).  Of this group, roughly           70% are regularly employed in academic and research institutions, 25%           are graduate students, and 5% are unaffiliated.  Approximately                  two-thirds are men, one-third are women.  This grant will assist 25 US          participants in this meeting with their roundtrip air fare on a US              flag carrier.",
