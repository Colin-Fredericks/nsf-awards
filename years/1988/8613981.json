 "awd_abstract_narration": "The analysis of stable isotope ratios in organisms and in the                   environment is an important method for investigating the structure of           food webs and the nature of biogeochemical pathways.  Plankton in the           Southern Ocean adjacent to Antarctica have the lowest 13C/12C ratios            yet found for pelagic organisms.  Despite some previous research this           depletion of 13C in Antarctic plankton has not been satisfactorily              explained.  The answer to this question is important because this               isotopic anomaly is an unambiguous indication that carbon                       biogeochemistry in the Southern Ocean must in some way be markedly              different from the rest of the present ocean.  The 13C depletion in             Antarctic plankton could also have a direct bearing on the                      paleoceanographic interpretation of similar depletions found in the             marine sedimentary record.  Rau and his collaborators propose to                measure 13C/12C and 15N/14N ratios in biota and particulate organic             matter in the southern Atlantic Ocean, Drake Passage, Scotia Sea and            Weddell Sea.  The carbon isotopic measurements will address the                 problems mentioned above; the nitrogen isotopic measurements will               provide further information on the nature of the food web and will              facilitate the testing of hypotheses concerning the causes of the               variations in isotopic abundances.  The results of this project will            directly complement the work of other scientists in the ongoing                 Antarctic Marine Ecosystem Research in the Ice Edge Zone (AMERIEZ)              project and address an area of research recommended for special                 attention by the Polar Research Board.",
