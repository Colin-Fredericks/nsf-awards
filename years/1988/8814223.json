 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to study the mechanics of                     granular material from micro-structural point view to obtain the                stress-strain relationship.  The focus of this research is to                   formulate the stress-strain relationship for large strain                       problems with a continuum representation which will be studied                  with particular attention to the fundamental understanding of the               behavior of granular systems, such as energy dissipation, stress-               dilatancy characterists, etc..                                                                                                                                  The objective will be achieved by redefining the continuum                      variables, stress and strain, in terms of contact forces and                    micro geometrical measures.  The stress-strain relationship will                be developed by considering the sliding, and rotation of the                    particles.  The theory will be then extended for pickings made of               multi-sized and non-spherical shape particles.                                                                                                                  Experimental studies on assemblies of rods and computer                         simulation will be conducted to aid the development the theory.                 the results from the experimental studies and computer                          simulation along with the available date from studies on natural                granular systems, such as sands, will be used to validate the                   developed theory.",
