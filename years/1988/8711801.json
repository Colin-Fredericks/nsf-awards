 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is much to be learned about how chromosomes are                           faithfully transmitted during mitosis and meiosis.                              Determining the detailed structure of an entire eukaryotic                      chromosome should yield much information about its function.                    As a first step toward this goal, we have been cloning and                      studying the sequence organization of the 260 kb DNA molecule                   from chromosome I, the smallest Saccharomyces cerevisiae                        chromosome.  We have cloned approximately 75% of it and                         determined the physical location of most if its known genes.                    We propose to clone and restriction map the remaining DNA,                      further map all vegetatively expressed transcribed regions                      and physically map the not yet located known genes.  These                      studies will provide the foundation for locating ARS elements                   and other sequences that could be involved in chromosome                        function.  To address the question of meiotic chromosome                        function, the relationship between physical and recombination                   distances over the entire length of the DNA molecule will be                    examined and the total recombination map-length between                         molecularly defined ends will be determined.  These                             experiments will enable us to estimate how often chromosome I                   homologues undergo recombination and will enhance our                           understanding of the meiotic behavior of a single chromosome.                                                                                                   Hybridization studies suggest that chromosome I contains                        approximately 100 protein encoding genes.  Despite intense                      effort, only 5 genes essential for growth on rich medium and                    5 other genes were defined by classically induced mutations.                    Thus, like all other yeast chromosomes, the function of most                    chromosome I genes has yet to be determined.  To define                         additional essential and nonessential genes on chromosome I,                    gene-disruption mutations in transcribed regions with no                        defined function will be induced by \"shuttle mutagenesis\".                      These studies will be used to estimate the total number of                      essential genes on chromosome I and should provide the basis                    for estimating the total number of essential genes needed for                   growth and division of a simple eukaryotic cell.  This work                     is unique in that no complete eukaryotic chromosome has yet                     been cloned and characterized.  The resulting information                       should increase our understanding of chromosome structure and                   function.",
