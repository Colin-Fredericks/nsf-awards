 "awd_abstract_narration": "Currently several major free.electron laser (FEL) projects              are planned or are underway to generate short wavelength                        radiation in the VUV and XUV regions.  These efforts involve                    large storage ring or linear accelerators and magnetic wiggler                  magnets several meters long.  An alternative approach to these                  large and expensive undertakings is to construct an FEL with low                energy electron beam (< 1 MeV) and an optical pump field provided               by a laser beam.  The latter approach has several technological                 problems associated with it which up to now have been                           insurmountable.  These technological problems can be overcome                   with an innovative electron gun design which has already                        exhibited brightness values   10.4 higher than those available for              large accelerators.  This gun could be used in conjunction with                 commercially available excimer lasers to operate an oscillator in               the XUV and VUV wavelength regions.                                                     The first phase of this program will analyze the FEL gain               and operating parameters and identify the key issues for the                    design of the oscillator cavity.  The construction of a prototype               instrument and a proof.of.principle experiment at 1400 A will be                the primary goal of Phase 2 with extension to XUV and soft X.ray                to follow.",
