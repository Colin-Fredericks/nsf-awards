 "awd_abstract_narration": "Summer undergraduate research opportunities in the Department of                Biological Sciences at Wellesley College, and undergraduate                     college for women, will be offered to ten students for the summer               of 1988.  Participants will be selected from junior Biology,                    Biological Chemistry or Psychobiology majors who have serious                   purpose and definite interest in independent work, have                         sufficient course preparation and have shown ability to think                   imaginatively and independently.  Participants will be selected                 by the project director and faculty committee after evaluation of               application forms designed to recruit the best qualified students               for particular projects.  The student will participate in all                   aspects of the investigation, from pursuing a literature review                 to carrying out experimental procedures and observations,                       continuing to analysis of data and determination of conclusions.                She will formally and informally discuss the work with her                      advisor, and also will prepare several discussions with all                     fellow participants, both student and faculty, for weekly group                 seminars.  This will encourage both experience with oral                        presentations and exposure to suggestions and criticism of others               involved in research.  Research reports at the end of the program               will involve the writing of a paper, preparation of a poster for                a poster session and also colloquia presentations to students and               faculty during the next academic year.  Throughout the summer                   program seminars will be presented by women scientists in                       research careers in academia, industry and medicine; at least one               field trip to a biotechnology company will be taken.",
