The Roundtable is an experiment of an alternate to the                 traditional study commission approach to science and technology                 policy issues.  This experimental approach has two unique                       characteristics:                                                                                                                                                  --Involvement of all sectors that share responsibility for the                stewardship of the scientific and engineering enterprise i.e.                   government, universities and industry                                             --An ongoing nature which provides a means for addressing the                 important issues within a structure that provides for continuity                and follow up.                                                                                                                                                  The topics addressed by the NAS Government-University-Industry                  Roundtable have direct relevance to NSF planning and evaluation                 activities.  The Roundtable plans to extend studies of                          streamlined administrative procedures and grant instruments for                 Federal support of university research.  Additional topics for                  study include:  Strategies for science and education in an                      environment of budget constraints; participation of foreign                     students in the U.S. scientific and engineering enterprise; means               for fostering multi disciplinary research and education; and,                   other critical topics impacting on the science and engineering                  infrastructure.",
