 "awd_abstract_narration": "Taxonomic research is the basic tool by means of which all              evolutionary, ecological, and other biological studies on species               can be accomplished. Also, for studies of endangered species and                for the numerous biological inventories now in preparation,                     misidentifications or misinterpretations, undocumented findings,                and incorrect species names can produce confusion and disaster.                 Dr. Rupert Barneby of the New York Botanical Garden and his                     colleague Dr. James Grimes are conducting a basic taxonomic study               of the tropical legume genus Pithecellobium and other genera                    associated with it, in an attempt to find stable morphological                  features that will permit reliable identification of all species.               They will conduct field work in South America to gather new                     material, to supplement existing herbarium specimens, and they                  will add new data from scanning electron microscopy of pollen,                  known to show extensive variation among these plants. To begin                  the project, they will focus on a number of segregate genera with               50 or so species, before tackling the whole genus, estimated to                 include over 160 species, mostly in the New World tropics.                      Resources at New York Botanical Garden are excellent for this                   project.",
