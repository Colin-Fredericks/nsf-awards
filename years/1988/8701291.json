 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past 10-15 years atmospheric chemistry has evolved from            a young research discipline devoted primarily to local problems of              urban pollution and air quality to a mature science concerned with              the hemispheric to global scale cycling of a wide variety of chemical           species.  To a large extent this change has resulted from an                    increasing realization that human activities can cause chemical                 disturbances to the natural troposphere on scales far beyond local              concerns.  Well-known examples include changes in the                           regional-to-global concentrations of certain nitrogen compounds, lead           and other heavy metals, artificial radionuclides, a number of                   synthetic organic substances, certain acid-forming species, carbon              dioxide and methane.  These chemical changes in the atmosphere can              often extend to the earth's soils, oceans, and biota far from the               original source region.  They can result in alterations in the                  earth's climate, changes in vital nutrient cycles, and impact                   significantly on the public health and quality of life on earth.                    The Atmosphere/Ocean Chemistry Experiment (AEROCE) will be a                coordinated multi-institutional atmospheric and marine chemistry                research project centered in the North Atlantic region.  The ultimate           goal of the AEROCE project will be the development of a predictive              capability for the continentally derived species observed in the                marine troposphere over the North Atlantic.  The selection of sites             and the measurement protocol in AEROCE has been developed jointly by            modelers and field experimentalists.                                                Wet deposition will be collected at the four islands in the North           Atlantic Ocean: Bermuda, Ireland, Barbados and Tenerife.  The wet               deposition will be analyzed for Ca++, Mg++, Na+, K+, Cl-, H+, NH4+,             NO3-, SO4=, and methanesulfonate (MSA).  The resulting data and their           variability will be used to establish a chemical climatology for wet            deposition over the North Atlantic Ocean.  The sources (natural and             anthropogenic) that affect the composition of wet deposition will be            investigated.  The sampling sites are downwind of North America and             thus are ideal stations for investigating not only the fate of the              North American plume but also the interaction of the plume with the             North Atlantic Ocean background atmosphere.",
