 "awd_abstract_narration": "A workshop will be conducted on future contributions of women to                the field of ecosystem science.  It is anticipated that ever                    greater numbers of qualified women will be required in political                and intellectual leadership roles in ecosystem science over the                 coming years, primarily because the task of sustaining the                      world's natural resources is greater than the currently available               manpower.  While the number of women entering the field of                      ecosystem science has increased substantially over the past ten                 years, the number of women attaining leadership positions does                  not reflect this increase.  It is critically important that women               be cognizant of new directions in ecosystem sciences and that                   they be prepared to assume a greater role in contributing to                    scientific leadership.  The goal of this workshop is to prepare                 women for these future leadership roles.  Specific objectives are               (1) to present current research in the context of future                        directions of ecosystem science, (2) to inform women about future               research directions and funding opportunities, and (3) to foster                communication among women ecologists.                                                                                                                           The organizers for this effort are excellent young scientists.                  The facilities of Colorado State University are more than                       adequate and are conducive to a useful workshop.                                                                                                                Funding at the level requested can be enthusiastically                          recommended.",
