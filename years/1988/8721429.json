This international                 meeting has been scheduled at five year intervals and this                      Congress will be the fifth one that is devoted exclusively to                   this area of science.  The amount of travel support, $20,000, is                based on the number of American plant pathologists involved in                  planning the program and invited to participate, the number who                 have indicated that they are planning to participate if funding                 is available and an estimate of the financial support required to                                                                                               enable this country to be represented properly at this important                Congress.  The Society will assume responsibility for meeting at                which it is critical to have appropriate participation by U.S.                  scientists as many other countries also have strong research                    interests in these aspects of plant biology.  The principal                     investigator, Dr. Kelman, is a highly regarded plant biologist                  and the Society has a proven track record in managing an                        international travel award effort.",
