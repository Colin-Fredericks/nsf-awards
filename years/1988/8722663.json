 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Theodore F. Morse and a graduate student          from Brown University for several short term research visits to Ruhr            University in Bochum, West Germany, to collaborate with Professor               Gerhard Schiffner, head of the Opto-Electronics Laboratory and                  Professor Martin Fiebig, head of the Heat and Mass Transfer                     Laboratory.  They are collaborating in several aspects of the design,           fabrication and testing of novel optical fibers for sensor and other            opto-electronic applications.  Brown is one of the few U.S.                     universities equipped for the fabrication of such special sensor                fibers.  Their research program emphasizes new techniques of preform            fabrication, the study of specially doped preforms for use as sensors,          fiber lasers, polarization maintaining fibers, and studies of stress            induced effects in fibers.  They are also studying how processing               affects the manner in which rare earth dopants are incorporated into a          glass matrix.  Prof Schiffner has extensive experience in                       opto-electronics, special fibers, applications of fiber sensors, and            fiber lasers.  Collaboration with his lab will include a study of               frequency doubling in silica based fibers, using a variety of dopants           to increase efficiency of second harmonic conversion.  This will be             helpful in guiding the special fiber designs at Brown to achieve                optimum performance in specific sensor applications.  The main focus of         the cooperative research with Prof. Fiebig will be fundamental studies          of the fluid mechanics, combustion and deposition mechanisms                    responsible for the success of preform fabrication by the Modified              Chemical Vapor Deposition Process (MCVD).  Significant advances in              state of the art materials research should result from the                      interdisciplinary expertise and facilities possessed by these                   collaborators.                                                                                                                                                  While the technology of silica communications fiber is maturing, the            potential for useful specialty fibers for sensors, lasers, and                  nonlinear optics is largely untapped.  Optical fiber sensors require a          multidisciplinary approach with expertise in waveguide propagation,             materials properties and fabrication.  The proposed research to enhance         processing techniques to achieve increased purity, and also to                  incorporate rare earth dopants to produce the asymmetry needed for a            variety of nonlinear fiber devices, is at the forefront of this rapidly         moving field.",
