 "awd_abstract_narration": "While much is known about the parasitic interactions among              animals, little is known about factors governing the parasitic                  interactions among higher plants.  This study will focus on the                 water and nutrient relations between a parasite (mistletoe) and                 its host (juniper) under natural and experimentally modified                    environmentally modified environmental conditions in the field.                 The proposed study will test specific hypotheses relating to the                water and nutrient fluxes between host and parasite, and should                 lead to new insights on the factors governing these interactions                as well as to new insights on why this form of biological                       interaction might have evolved.  As part of the  approach, this                 study will utilize a new and powerful tool in the ecological                    sciences, stable isotope ratio analysis at natural abundance                    levels, to estimate long-term physiological performance of both                 host and parasite.  Among the applied aspects of this study,                    mistletoes account for a significant decrease in timber                         productivity nationally and if we can get a better understanding                of the factors governing host-parasite interactions we are more                 likely to achieve an understanding of how to control this serious               pest to the lumber industry.//",
