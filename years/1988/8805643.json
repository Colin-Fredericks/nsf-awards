 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although it has become axiomatic that pollinators respond to               numerous plant traits, the nature of these responses have not                   been studied in appreciable depth.  This research is designed to                investigate one such response:  the collection of nectar by                     bumblebees.  The research will determine whether natural                        selection can operate on plants in such a  way that subtle                      changes in rates of nectar production might yield increases in                  plant fitness.  Nineteen descrete, yet interrelated, hypotheses                 will be tested.  These are designed to allow an independent                     assessment of reproductive output.  Additionally, reproductive                  output will be measured in terms of both seed number and quality.               Polemonium foliosissimum, a Rocky Mountain perennial herb whose                 reproductive biology has been intensely studied for the past                    decade, will serve as the study organism.  Completion of the                    proposed project will yield more data relating to floral nectar                 production in P. foliosissimum than is currently available for                  any other taxon.",
