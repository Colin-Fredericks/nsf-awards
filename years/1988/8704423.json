Through this grant for                  connection to NSFNET, they will be able to access six                           federally-funded supercomputing centers which are linked by the                 National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET).  The campus will                  be connected by a medium speed (56,000 baud per second)                         communication line to the JVNC network as part of a New England                 extension to their already existing consortium network.  This                   communication line as well as the gateway/router will be                        provided by the John von Neumann Center through a supplemental                  grant to their current award.  Network management service will                  also be provided by JVNC.",
