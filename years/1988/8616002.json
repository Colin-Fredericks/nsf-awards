 "awd_abstract_narration": "Texas A&M University proposes to operate the                               research vessel (R/V) GYRE for a total of 280 days in 1987.                     However, the anticipated demand for shiptime aboard GYRE did                    not materialize and the total use of GYRE in support of NSF                     projects is not expected to exceed 57 days in 1987.                                  All of the proposed legs are in support of NSF projects                    funded through the Division of Ocean Sciences.  Principal                       investigators using this ship are all from Texas A&M                            University.  The primary use of the ship will be for physical                   oceanography.  R/V GYRE  is an appropriate vessel for the                       proposed operations, and the marine operations staff at Texas                   A&M University, including a new marine superintendent, are                      fully capable of carrying out the work that has been proposed                        Due to the variable nature of ship operations and                          associated costs, program has found that single year grants to                  not provide maximum efficiency of management.  Three-year                       continuing grants allow for better long-range planning and                      adjustments to major changes in operating schedules due to                      breakdowns, cancellations, and other factors impacting on                       subsequent  years.   Therefore program recommends that this FY                  1987 award be processed as the first year of a three-year                       continuing grant.",
