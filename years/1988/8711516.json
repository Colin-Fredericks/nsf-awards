 "awd_abstract_narration": "Perhaps the most fundamental question that must be answered for any             transposable element system is:  \"What encodes the autonomous                   (transposase) function and how is it transmitted?\"  That is the primary         question we address for the Mu transposon system in maize.  Five                different approaches are proposed.  1) A newly discovered Mu transposon         is structurally consistent with autonomy.  The element will be added            using T-DNA to a special tester line of tobacco plantlets:  If the              transposon is autonomous it will specify \"excisase\" that will revert a          tobacco gene, leading to a kanomycin-resistent tobacco.  A similar              experiment will be done using maize cells.  2) We recently discovered           that some Mu transposons have circular forms.  These will be                    microinjected into the tester tobacco line and into maize.  3) New Mu           transposons will be characterized.  4) We will use a series of genetic          crosses to evaluate hypotheses for Mu copy number control, and will             also obtain mutants affecting Mu excision by selecting rare \"phase              change\" phenotypes.  5) We also propose to identify the transposase             directly by looking for specific protein-Mu binding.  A secondary aim           involves characterization of Mu excision products.                                                                                                              The information sought in these proposed experiments is not only                essential for our understanding of this truly unique transposon system,         but is essential if Mu is to be useful for biotechnology.",
