 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research proposes to develop an innovative methodology for                 estimating the stability regions of large-scale nonlinear dynamical             systems.  The significance of the proposed methodology include:                 (1) its computational efficiency, (2) its ability to significantly              reduce the conservativeness in estimating the stability regions, (3)            its adaptability (this methodology is very general; it can stand by             itself or it can be synthesized with existing methods in the way that           they serve the input of the proposed methodology) and (4) its sound             theoretical basis.  At present, there does not exist any method that            is computationally practical, yet does not yield undesirably                    conservative result in estimating the stability regions for large-              scale nonlinear dynamical systems.  The existence of such a practical           method is very important for many engineering and scientific                    applications, as well as for many emerging research areas.  The                 proposed research is to meet this pressing need.  Also, the proposed            methodology opens new areas for research, both in the area of                   methodology development and in the area of new applications.",
