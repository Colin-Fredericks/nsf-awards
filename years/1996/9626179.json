 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626179  Ewing    The simulation of fluid flow in porous media related to groundwater   modeling, subsurface transport of contaminants, and petroleum reservoir   simulation requires the numerical approximation of large coupled systems   of nonlinear time-dependent partial differential equations.  The   development of efficient numerical techniques for the large-scale simulation   is extremely important in understanding these porous media flows.  Due to   wave-like or traveling front problems and highly localized natures in the   coupled differential systems and the enormous size of many reservoir   simulation problems, an important goal of efficient numerical modeling is   the ability to effectively model these effects and the utilization of new   supercomputer architectures.  This project will  concentrate on the   development of finite element methods, computational codes, and   supporting mathematical analysis for underground contamination flows.    The numerical methods will be designed to simulate such complex features   of the flows as shock-line saturation fronts and steep composition gradients,   to produce accurate fluid velocities, to conserve mass locally, and to take   advantage of new parallel supercomputers. Self-adaptive local grid-  refinement methods and efficient implementation techniques for iterative   solution of large linear systems are also studied.    A three-year program of research is proposed into the development of   accurate numerical techniques, efficient computational codes, and   supporting mathematical analysis for  modeling of multiphase flows and   transport in groundwater hydrology which has applications in design of   remediation and cleanup technologies.  The development of improved   methods for assessing groundwater contamination by hazardous wastes  has become increasingly important.  Indeed, groundwater supplies are   increasingly threatened by organic, inorganic, and radioactive contaminants   introduced into the environment by improper disposal or acci dental release.    Estimates of remediation costs at U.S. government sites alone range into the   hundreds of billions of dollars. Protecting the quality of groundwater   supplies is a grand challenge problem of broad societal importance.  There   are also a number of industrial applications of the proposed research.  The   production and management of oil reservoirs are governed by equations and  technologies that are nearly identical to those exploited in groundwater   hydrology.  The manufacture of high quality fiber reinforced plastic   composites for automotive and aerospace applications is controlled by   technology similar to that studied in this project.  Design of semiconductors   uses equations very analogous to those for groundwater transport.  In these   areas, technology transfer can be easily carried out: use of the codes   developed for, industrial collaboration with the researchers of, and   employment of students trained on this project.",
