 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of  10       undergraduate students each year in the Undergraduate       Research in Neuroscience program offered by Ohio University.       The program is a self-contained ten week introduction to       research in neuroscience that is constructed around four       main ideas.  First, through lectures from scientific workers       including graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, college       and university faculty, grant administrators, and       researchers in private industry, the participants acquire a       general knowledge of the rewards, requirements, and       structure of a research career.  Second, they achieve a       basic understanding of neuroscience through 42 hrs. of       structured classroom instruction.  Third, in order to       directly experience the joys and frustrations of research,       they work with a faculty mentor of their choice to study a       particular research topic, analyze their results, and       present their findings in written form and orally at a       colloquium at the end of the program.  Fourth, in order to       gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be a       research scientist, each student is assigned a graduate       student mentor and is also exposed to a variety of       professional, academic, and social settings where the       students can interact with research scientists at all levels       from graduate students to professors.  Particular care has       been taken to structure the program so that the students       continually advance to greater independence as their       knowledge and skills develop; funds are provided for       particularly qualified students to attend scientific       conferences to present their results and  experience even       greater exposure to the culture of science.            This award will foster the continued education and  training of individuals who   will be part of the next generation  of basic researchers in the diverse aspects of     neuroscience.",
