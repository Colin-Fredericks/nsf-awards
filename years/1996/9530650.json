 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Harry Morrison of Purdue University will conduct a project with   funding from the Organic Dynamics Program of the Chemistry Division   emphasizing the study of the limitations and consequences of movement of   electronic energy through `photonic wires.`  These are assemblies of   chromophores pendant on or incorporated into a passive framework, and in   particular in the present case the passive framework is the steroid ring   system.  The transfer of electronic excitation absorbed by `antenna`   chromophores to distal, formally unconjugated, groups may produce   chemistry or quenching, depending on the groups, and Professor Morrison   will be determining the ground rules for each.  The study will be   complemented by parallel theoretical and experimental studies intended to   determine the role of through space mixing of orbitals in determining   such ground rules.  These studies will be accomplished in part by   cooperative studies with senior collaborators at other institutions.  An   added effort will be made to understand the role of the second excited   singlet state in indene photochemistry.  The use of light in information transmission, storage, and retrieval is   changing modern society.  This project will generate basic results   pertinent to the ability to use light in modulation of information   transmission on the scale of an organic molecule. It will also support   experimental results with theoretical calculations which allow a   generalized picture to be developed.",
