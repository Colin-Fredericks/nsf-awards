These changes reflect changes in the relationship of the government and academic institutions and, in turn, changes in the perceptions of the institutions and their faculty as they view of their own roles in society.  Although such change is normal and healthy, increasingly the impetus for change comes from lack of growth in support for faculty research by Federal agencies, increased emphasis on teaching by the largest institutions, and changing patterns of employment among graduates.  The effects of these changes on institutional policy and practice, and their implications for Federal agencies that fund research ald education in the biological sciences will be explored.  ***",
