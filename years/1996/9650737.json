 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brevard Community College, a multi-campus, co-educational community college located on the east coast of Florida, is establishing three computerized mathematics laboratories at the Melbourne Campus and one at the College's Institute for Space Technology. The laboratories will be part of a comprehensive effort to reform the entire mathematics curriculum that addresses improving teaching techniques and focuses on increasing students' understanding of and success in mathematics at all levels. The target student audience includes all students requiring an introductory college level mathematics course or greater to complete degree requirements, and student employees of the Kennedy Space Center requiring mathematics as a component of space technology related training programs.    Cooperative learning techniques will be implemented as small student groups use the computer to simulate mathematical equations, explore related mathematical concepts, and test possible solutions. As they perform computer-based activities in their groups, students will organize their own mathematical concepts, enabling them to learn more effectively and improve their mathematical problem solving skills.    Evaluation of the project will consist of comparing student success rates, satisfaction, and retention in classes using the reformed pedagogy to traditional lecture-based classes. Assessing project impact will also take into consideration how improving mathematical competency will contribute to enhanced job skills of Kennedy Space Center employees. The proposed reforms can serve as a model for other institutions wishing to initiate similar changes to their own curricula.",
