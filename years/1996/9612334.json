Among the most serious  problems are the random gene insertion into the host  chromosome, immune responses caused by the natural  viral proteins, and low cell selectivity and efficiency  in the transfer.  Also, neither adenoviral nor  retrovial vectors can incorporate genes over 7 or 8 kb  in size.    There is a growing body of work demonstrating that  certain ligands have the ability to bind DNA and effect  its transfer into cells through very selective surface  receptor binding.  Thus conjugate gene delivery offers  and improved delivery potential but has not been  studied in enough detail to demonstrate feasibility.   For gene transfer use.    This proposal seeks to gain information on the rate-  limiting steps of the receptor-mediated DNA/ligand-  conjugate transport from the cell surface to the  nucleus.  Specific aims include: A. Determine whether  cellular internalization is a limiting factor; B.   Determine where in the endosomal sorting pathways  conjugates escape to the cytosol; C.  Predict and test  desirable ligand properties to effect the transfer.    The program will study the transfer of the epidermal  growth factor (EGF) gene into mouse fibroblast cells  that contain previously transfected EGF receptors.   This robust system will allow variation of all the key  factors.  The P.I.'s lab has extensive experience  working with the EGF system and has already  demonstrated reasonable success transferring EGF to the  mouse fibroblasts.  ***",
