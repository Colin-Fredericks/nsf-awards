 "awd_abstract_narration": "Zanakis  9632962  One of the major technological problems in the use of  advanced limb prosthetics is the inability of the user to  control the prosthesis in a manner which can mimic normal  function.  When nerves are severed or disrupted, control  over the limb is lost, even though the information for  control may still be present in the portions of the nerves  that were spared from damage or amputation.  If that  information can be used to operate the prosthesis, then  better control of the artificial limb can be achieved.  The  proposed research examines the effectiveness of components  designed to interface the peripheral nervous system with the  electronic hardware of the prosthetics.  The work will be  performed utilizing a multi-electrode cable (MEC) device  which uses muscle cells grown upon it in order to attract  the nerves to regenerate toward the MEC.  The interface will  be able to detect signals from the nerves, decode the nerve  impulses, and therefore control a prosthesis.  The first  part of the study will test this technology in rodents, to  determine if cut nerves can be attracted to the MEC, and if  the MEC can then decode signals from the nerve, particularly  for long periods of time.  Certain components of the rodent  experiments have already been performed successfully, and a  major goal of this study is to combine the many techniques  and determine if the entire system performs as a unit.  The  results of this experiment are crucial to the refinement and  increased utility of human limb prosthetics.",
