 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622563  Friedlander     S.Friedlander in collaboration with M.M.Vishik will continue  her investigation into mathematical problems that arise in fluid motion.  It is proposed to study the spectrum of small oscillations of an ideal  fluid about a given steady flow: this leads to the study of the spectrum  of a degenerate non-elliptic differential operator. The exact location of  the unstable continuous spectrum will be determined purely in terms of  dynamical systems quantities. Examples of fluid instability due to the  discrete part of the spectrum will be studied analytically and numerically.  It was recently proved that,under certain assumptions, linear instability  of a steady inviscid flow implies nonlinear (Lyapunov) instability. It is  proposed to extend the range of applicability of this result.Another line  of research is the study of instabilities for the augmented system of   fluid equations that govern magnetohydrodynamics. A sufficient condition  for instability has been derived in terms of a system of local PDE. It  is proposed to apply this criterion to demonstrate instability of certain  astrophysical models.  %%%   All fluid motions are continually subject to small disturbances  ( eg, think of a tank of water in a laboratory that is \"disturbed\" by a  truck driving by outside ). A natural question arises as to whether the  the effect of the disturbance dies away leaving the fluid  in the same state as before --this is called stable--or the effect of the  disturbance is to change the configuration of the fluid--this is called  unstable. The question of fluid stability/instability is a classical one  that has received much attention in the scientific literature for more  than a century.It is fundamental to studies in meteorology, oceanography,  geophysics and astrophysics ; in particular, instabilities at the air/sea  interface are significant to any study of the global change of the  environment. The mathematics of fluid instabilities is governed by a  system of partial differ ential equations that are remarkably challenging  and interesting. Despite a century of study there are many open  mathematical questions connected with these equations. This proposal will  continue to address some of these open problems.  ***",
