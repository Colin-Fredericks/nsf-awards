 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gibbs  9630851      The gonadal steroid hormones have marked and various effects on the  central nervous system.  However, the receptors for these powerful  hormones are not restricted to areas of the brain involved in  reproduction, but are also found in the hippocampus and cerebral  cortex.  These areas receive dense input from neurons containing  the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.  It has long been postulated  that the cholinergic neurons play an important role in learning and  memory and may be influenced by a variety of factors, including  estrogen.  This effect of estrogen may be mediated, in part, by  growth factors.  In the experiments supported by this award, the  effects of estrogen on acetylcholinergic function and growth factor  production are being investigated.  These studies will provide  significant new information regarding the mechanisms by which  estrogens influence cognitive function.  As populations age,  estrogen levels decline and how this impacts on cognitive function  is crucial to improving the quality of life of the general  population.",
