 "awd_abstract_narration": "9528826  Goodenough    Previous studies of the evolution of electronic properties  have revealed that nature accommodates the first-order  character of the cross-overs in a variety of ways: from  localized to itinerant electronic behavior, from primarily  ionic to primarily covalent metal-oxygen bonding in mixed-  metal oxides, from Curie-Weiss to Pauli paramagnetism in  both single-valent and mixed-valent systems.  Classical  phase segregation, charge-density waves, or ferroelectric  displacements represent static accommodations that are well-  studied. This research addresses the more subtle problem of  dynamic accommodations. Initially, a major emphasis will be  placed on oxides with perovskite-related structures. An ABO3  perovskite contains a BO3 array of corner-shared BO6  octahedra. A mismatch between the A-O and B-O equilibrium  bond lengths may be relieved by a cooperative rotation of  the BO6 octahedra that bend the B-O-B bond angle from 180 .  Perovskites with transition-metal B cations may contain,  depending on the strength of the B-O-B interactions, either  B-cation redox couples or narrow, antibonding bands with  energies close to or overlapping the Fermi energy. The  strength of a B-O-B interaction and therefore the bandwidth  and the band occupancy of the BO3 array may be varied by  isovalent and/or aliovalent substitution on the A sites.  Moreover, the ca 180  B-O-B bond may accommodate the  coexistence of different B-O bond strengths within the same  crystallographic structure by the displacement of a bridging  atom toward one B atom and away from the other on the  opposite side. These displacements are generally cooperative  and may be either static or dynamic. The phenomenon of high-  temperature superconductivity appears to be one example of a  dynamic accommodation. Another is the apparent coexistence  of Mott-Hubbard and Fermi-liquid states in the perovskite  system Srl-xCaxV03 where spectral weight is transferred from  the latter to the former.  Several techniques are de veloped  for synthesizing these marginally stable oxides, and  measuring the temperature dependence of resistance, magnetic  susceptibility, and Seebeck coefficient under pressure.  These probes can give important, if indirect, information on  dynamic processes.  %%%  This research is motivated by three fundamental questions:  1) What is the underlying physical process responsible for  the phenomenon of high-TC superconductivity? 2) How can one  use the understanding of this phenomenon as a guide in the  design of improved high-TC materials? 3) What are the  different ways by which nature accommodates the transition  from localized to itinerant electronic behavior in solids?  Initial emphasis will be placed on the study of oxides with  perovskite-related structures.",
