 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, the department is upgrading its analytical/inorganic program and improving and expanding upper-level laboratories by adding instructional grade instruments and modest facilities for XRD analysis.   As part of the project, the department is delivering an innovative course in analytical methods applied to inorganic solid-state materials. The course follows the upper-level lecture course in inorganic chemistry, which provides students with basic theory in structure and stability and gives them a hands-on introduction to molecular modeling (MO) and MO methods. With this background, students can synthesize and characterize derivatives of a selected class of interesting solid-state materials. Characterization includes structural analyses by single crystal x-ray diffraction, XRD, determination of magnetic susceptibility, EPR analysis of magnetic state, and analysis of frontier states and redox chemistry. The class of materials selected demonstrates interesting magnetic, electrical, and spectral properties and crystallize in multiple crystal habits. Thus, they serve as an excellent \"medium\" of analysis. A pilot course has been mounted and run successfully with eight students. As a team-taught course, this course is being inserted into the curriculum without decreasing other course offerings and without burdening the instructors.",
