 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests travel support for U.S. participants  in the International Seminar-Cum-School On Macromolecular  Crystallographic Data that will be held in Calcutta from  November 16th to the 20th, 1995.  This workshop focuses on  the use and implementation of structural biology databases  and  their application to research problems such as  structure-based drug design, protein engineering and  structure analysis.  This workshop is sanctioned by the  International Union of Crystallography Commission on  Biological Macromolecules and is part of efforts to insure  that all of the international community has access to the  repositories and contributes to the development of these  critical resources.  The workshop will focus on teaching the  most current methodology and techniques for deposition,  validation, retrieval and use of macromolecular structural  data, and the application to specific research problems that  include drug design and protein engineering.  The workshop  in India is timely because of the recent expansion of Indian  scientists will enhance the developing research programs and  provide scientists from throughout the world access to data  that results from the success of these efforts.",
