Dr. Morling will work with Dr.  Shinobu Kitayama, professor in the Division of Integrated  Human Studies, on a research project entitled, \"Cross-  Cultural Concepts of Psychological Control.\"    The proposed research will: 1) develop a positive, active  description of self-directed control by collecting examples  of control in Japan; 2) examine cross-cultural data to  ascertain whether self-directed control is indeed more  common in Japan or in the United States, and; 3) investigate  the positively framed conception of self-directed control  and its relationship to emotional and mental well-being.  Recent research in social psychology has established that  feelings of control over the environment contribute to  mental and physical health, the primary research question  being which strategies individuals use to adapt to external  realities.  Preliminary studies in Japan suggest that self-  directed control strategies are more widely used than other  adjustment strategies, and because these are not emphasized  in Western culture, they remain understudied.  The research  will provide significant insight into the creation of  psychological confidence, competence, and well-being in  Japan, with the results likely to provide lessons for  strategies of social adaptation across cultures.  ***",
