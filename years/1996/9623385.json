 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623385  Harley    Because motor vehicles are the largest contributor to air  pollution in most U.S. cities, improved control equipment is  required on all new cars and trucks, and reformulated clean-  burning fuels are required for older vehicles in order to  achieve immediate emission reductions.  To address motor  vehicle emission problems, the research will: (1) develop  new, accurate inventories of motor vehicle emissions; (2)  study the causes of excess vehicle emissions; (3) develop  and use mathematical models to study the formation of  photochemical air pollution; and (4) determine the effects  of reformulated gasoline on ambient concentrations of ozone  and other air pollutants.  An alternate approach to  calculating emissions will be developed using infrared  remote sensing measurements of emissions from thousands of  in-use vehicles.  Measurements of vehicle emissions under various operating  conditions will be used to assess the robustness of emission  control systems.  In addition, the frequency of emission  control system failures will be studied as a function of  vehicle age.  The air quality impacts of various  technological approaches to controlling vehicle emissions  will then be compared.  An Eulerian photochemical air quality model will be  developed to assess the impact of motor vehicle emissions on  ozone.  The chemical mechanism in the air quality model will  be extended to include the reactions of relevant oxygenated  compounds such as methyl-butyl ether (NME) which are  required in reformulated gasoline.  Performance of the air  quality model will be verified using measurements from  historical air pollution episodes in the San Francisco air  basin.  The air quality model will then be used to predict  changes in ozone formation due to use of reformulated  gasoline.  Novel approaches to control of vehicle emissions  will be assessed and compared.  The proposed educational plan has the following objectives:  (1) to develop and teach new environmental engineering  lecture  courses; (2) to develop and test new experiments to  be included in a new environmental engineering lab class;  and (3) to encourage minority students in local schools to  apply to college-level science and engineering programs.",
