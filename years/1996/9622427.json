 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an investigation on number-theoretical  problems on zeta functions and automorphic forms. The Euler  products associated to  automorphic forms, Eisenstein series, and  the special values of certain  zeta functions are the main  objects of study. The theory of such Euler products (or zeta  functions) is one of the central themes of modern number theory,  and Eisenstein series are analytic functions inseparably  connected to them. The investigation of special values of zeta  functions is  relatively new, but has become the subject of  increasing interest.    This research falls into the general  mathematical field of Number Theory.  Number theory has its  historical roots in the study of the whole numbers,  addressing  such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one   whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of  mathematics and  was pursued for many centuries for purely  aesthetic reasons. However, within  the last half century it has  become an indispensable tool in diverse  applications in areas  such as data transmission and processing, and  communication  systems.",
