 "awd_abstract_narration": "9526034  Heacox        The  objective of the research to be carried is to deduce reliable  observational constraints on the theories of the formation  of  binary  star  systems. There is very little currently known about the  overall  binary  stellar  system characteristics which are  relevant  to  their  formation.   In particular, we do not know whether the masses  of  the  secondary  stars in binary systems are distributed in the same  manner  as those of primary and single stars.  There is almost no knowledge of  the   values  and  ranges  of  the  orbital  angular  momenta   values  characterizing   binary  stars.  This  last  issue   is   particularly  important, since binary star orbits may act as the repositories of the  original  angular  momentum of the dense cloud cores  from  which  the  systems   form,   thus  aiding  in  the  formation  of   the   central  concentration  of material necessary for star formation.   A  reliable  estimate   of   the   joint  distribution  of  semi-major   axes   and  secondary/primary mass ratios, characterizing binaries as a whole,  is  needed  to  correct these deficiencies.  The method for deducing  this  distribution   is   that   of  statistical   modeling,   wherein   the  distributions  of  the  desired intrinsic characteristics  (semi-major  axes,  mass  ratios) are related to those of the observable quantities  (orbital  periods,  velocities, etc.) in a deterministic  manner  that  preserves  all  the information in the data.  Mathematically  rigorous  methods of developing such models will be used, as well as the use  of  the  means  of  their  statistical inversion,  to  infer  the  desired  intrinsic  distribution from that of the observables.  Model  outlines  will  be given for all observational binary star types (spectroscopic,  visible, etc.).  These models will be used with the data, from  recent  and future observationally unbiased surveys of binary star systems, to  determine  the joint distributions of semi-major axes and mass  rat ios  characterizing  binary  star  systems of  homogeneous  primary  types.  These  distributions of characteristics may then be used  to  directly  determine  the  secondary  mass function and distribution  of  orbital  angular   momentum   values   (and  other   dynamic   characteristics)  characterizing binary star systems as a whole.    The resulting distributions will constitute the first truly meaningful  observational constraints on the dominant mode of star formation (most  stars are members of binary systems).  This will help to determine the  extent  to  which any of the current theories of binary star formation  are  correct,  and advance our understanding of the  process  of  star  formation in general.  ***",
