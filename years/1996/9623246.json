 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623246  Harp    Multilayer  magnetic thin films containing 4d elements  (Nb,  Mo,  Ru,  Rh, Pd) are fabricated as candidate materials  for  enhanced  magnetic properties.  Properties of  interest  are  magnetic moment, magnetic anisotropy, magnetoresistance, and  Kerr  rotation.   All of these properties are  critical  for  magnetic  recording applications.  Magnetic  properties  are  characterized using magnetometry, magnetotransport,  and  x-  ray  diffraction.  The students involved with this  research  will  be  employable in the magnetic data storage  industry,  and  are encouraged to gain experience relevant to industry,  such as with sputter deposition of thin films.  Students are  given   support   for   summer  internships   in   industry.  Furthermore,  an upper level undergraduate course  in  solid  state physics is developed that uses computer simulations to  demonstrate basic concepts.  %%%  Of  all  the  more than 100 elements, only three  transition  metals,  iron cobalt, and nickel are ferromagnetic  at  room  temperature.  As a result, these three are incorporated into  nearly  every  device  that  uses magnetic  materials,  from  electric motors to computer hard disk drives.  This research  aims  at  making new ferromagnetic materials by  sandwiching  very  thin  layers of some other transition  metals  between  layers  of iron, cobalt, nickel, or other materials.   These  layers  are  only a few atoms thick.  Theories predict  that  such  `multilayer' structures may possess properties  useful  to improved computer hard disk drives. The students involved  with  this research will be employable in the magnetic  data  storage  industry,  and are encouraged  to  gain  experience  relevant  to  industry, such as with sputter  deposition  of  thin   films.   Students  are  given  support   for   summer  internships  in  industry.   Furthermore,  an  upper   level  undergraduate  course  in solid state physics  is  developed  that   uses   computer  simulations  to  demonstra te   basic  concepts.  ***",
