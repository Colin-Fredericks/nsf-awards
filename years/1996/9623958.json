Sicker  Title:  \"CD-ROM Access Project\"                                  ABSTRACT    CD-ROMs are the most widely used form of multimedia in schools  and their use is expected to grow especially in the area of  science education.  People with print-disabilities (those with  visual impairments or learning disabilities) currently are unable  to use most hardware and software (including CD-ROMs) that base  their information displays on a \"graphical user interface\" (GUI).   This application proposes to initiate a research project leading  to CD-ROM-based science instructional materials that are useable  by people with print-disabilities.  To reach this goal, it will  be necessary to establish standards for multimedia accessibility.   The project proposes development of design guidelines for  multimedia accessibility concentrating on science, engineering,  and mathematics instructional materials published on CD-ROMs--  currently the most common form of multimedia-based instructional  materials.  Specifically, the project will:    - Research CD-ROM accessibility by conducting a CD-ROM       Accessibility Survey  - Explore access solutions to technology barriers through the       creation of adapted iterations   - Demonstrate accessibility with a model accessible SEM CD-ROM   - Develop Design Guidelines that recommend standards for       multimedia accessibility  - Distribute project results through a dissemination of findings.    It is expected that this Project will significantly impact blind,  visually impaired and learning disabled students by allowing them  to approach academic equality of opportunity with their sighted  peers in SEM education leading to increased representation in SEM  careers.  ***",
