 "awd_abstract_narration": "9627306  Combs    The California Museum of Science and Industry (CMSI) will develop  a new exhibit \"Body in Balance: Developing Integrative Life Science  Exhibits.\"  This will be a 3000 sq. ft. component in the new 17,500  sq. ft. World of Life Exhibit Hall when the CMSI opens its new  facility in 1997 and becomes the California Science Center.  The  World of Life is organized around several key science concepts  which emphasize the commonalties among living things and their life  processes.  One of the major ideas to be communicated in this area  is homeostasis as it applies to human beings.  Homeostasis has been  chosen because it is the unifying theme of system physiology.  The  exhibit will include seventeen exhibits (with a total of sixty-  seven interactive elements) as well as a \"The Body in Balance\"  theater presentations and bilingual (English/Spanish) exhibition  books.  This integrative view of body functions is consistent with  recommendations from Benchmarks for Science Literacy and the  Science Framework for California Public Schools Grades K-12.  A  broad menu of complementary formal education materials will be  developed.",
