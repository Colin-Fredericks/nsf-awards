 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623037  Gamba       This proposal concerns problems that model potential  compressible    fluid flow and charged-particle transport systems. The  compressible fluid     flow models  under  consideration  include the standard   transonic  flow      problem  in  gas  dynamics, its  viscous  approximations and   boundary      value problem,  and the  Mach  reflection problem  when  a   weak shock     (pressure) wave  collides  with an oblique obstacle. Models of  charged-    particle transport systems are  studied  within the framework  of  submicron      electronic  devices. In  particular  these models  include   electro-    hydrodynamic  or  energy-transport models  for semiconductors,  related     models for  plasmas,  boundary  value  problems and their high  field     approximations.   %%%       Areas of applications of the proposed research include  models in     aerodynamics and aircraft  design.  In  particular,  wing    performance just below supersonic speeds and wing design for  flight     in the upper atmosphere. These are  models  that describe how a  gas    moves around an object at high speeds (i.e. close to producing  sonic booms).     In addition models of ionized plasmas and electron transport  are considered.      In particular, the design and  performance simulation of  semiconductor     devices of extremely small size and even quantum level. The  models      under consideration  describe the flow of current in the  working of a     submicron or a quantum-scale electronic device. The core of the  proposal      focuses on issues related to  questions of validity and   stability of models      based on the available data. This information is of paramount  importance in      finding  the   best computational strategy for the computer  aided     simulation of experiments.   ***",
