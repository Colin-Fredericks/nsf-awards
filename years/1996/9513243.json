These meetings have been enormously  successful and have become one of the most important  international forums for discussing and critiquing progress  in the cell cycle field. These meetings are timely,  occurring when major advances in the cell cycle field needed  to be communicated to other researchers in this and related  fields. For instance, the 1991 Symposium contained reports  of the first insights into the relationships between cell  cycle control mechanisms and tumorigenesis, the role of  checkpoint pathways in genomic stability, the interaction  between cell cycle proteins and tumor suppressor proteins;  The 1994 meetings contained reports of the importance of the  CdK inhibitory proteins in the cell cycle. Current research  in the cell cycle field is beginning to provide insights  into mechanisms that control cellular differentiation,  apoptosis, senescence, tumorigenesis, and transcription.  These advancements as well as other biological processes  will be one focus of the 1996 meeting. Other areas of  interest will include cell cycle initiation, S phase  regulation, mitotic control, regulated protein proteolysis,  cell cycle transcription, and cell cycle checkpoints.  Platform presentations will be selected from submitted  abstracts, emphasis will be placed on graduate students and  post-doctoral fellows participation.  %%%  Since 1992, Cold Spring Harbor has held bi-annual meetings  on the Cell Cycle. The meetings have been enormously  successful and have become one of the most important  international forums for discussing and critiquing progress  in the cell cycle field. Past meetings were timely,  occurring when major advances in the cell cycle field needed  to be disseminated to other researchers in this and in  related fields. This meeting will be no exception. Topics to  be covered include understanding mechanisms that control  cellular differentiation, apoptosis, senescenc e,  tumorigenesis, transcription, cell cycle initiation, S phase  regulation, mitotic control, and other related biological  processes. Platform presentations will be selected entirely  from submitted abstracts, and strong emphasis will be placed  upon participation by graduate students and post-doctoral  fellows.  ***",
