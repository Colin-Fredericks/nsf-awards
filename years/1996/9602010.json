This is a meeting which has been supported for most, if not all, of the years during which it has grown from a small group of dedicated scientists working with corn  usually meeting in a university setting, to the large numbers of attendees which now must be accommodated in a conference center. Many scientists working with corn gave their first talk at this meeting which covers both basic and applied areas of the genetics, biochemistry, cell biology and biotechnology of maize research. Students at all levels are encouraged to go and encouraged to interact with the established attending scientists.  ***",
