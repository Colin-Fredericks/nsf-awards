 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate a novel VLSI arithmetic design approach using  reconfigurable architectures with shift switching, aimed at achieving an  innovative design methodology which could lead to a substantial improvement on  both speeds and areas for several arithmetic devices including parallel counters,  parallel compressors, parallel multipliers, precharged CMOS adders/comparators,  prefix parallel counters, as well as elementary function evaluations.  The  proposed technique will employ enhanced reconfigurable buses, i.e., buses  containing shift switches with buffers properly inserted. It possesses the  following new features.  First, when specified digital signals are propagating  through shift switching buses, the desired modulo operations can be performed  directly, which simplifies the traditional model of this basic arithmetic  computation. Second, after passing through each shift switch, the state signals  are inverted alternatively in two mutually inverted forms (n and p), which  minimizes the load of transistors and maximizes the speed of circuits. The  research will focus on the development of enhanced reconfigurable bus-based VLSI  schemes for important arithmetic operations.  The goals are to investigate:  1. shift switching parallel compressors and conditional compressors;   2. efficient partial product reduction schemes;  3. application-specific array processors for realization of some optimal  arithmetic algorithms;  4. various shift switching parallel counter schemes and their applications;   5. shift switching with precharge CMOS domino logic and its applications in  designing arithmetic devices and asynchronous arithmetic devices.",
