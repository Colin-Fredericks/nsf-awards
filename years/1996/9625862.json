 "awd_abstract_narration": "Whose  aim  is  to  investigate the integration  and  impacts  of  residential  Internet  use  among a  sample  of  some  100  urban  families  in  Pennsylvania  and  some  200  small-town  Minnesota  families. The Internet and commercial online services are growing  rapidly  with  a  substantial portion of  this  growth  occurring  through   connections   to  homes.  The  telecommunications   and  computing  industries  are  reorganizing  to  provide  electronic  services to households through computer-based telecommunications.  Despite these changes, we have little understanding of how people  at   home---in   their   roles  as  family   members,   students,  participants  in  the  labor force,  as  members  of  groups  and  communities,   or  as  citizens---would  use  the  new   services  available to them. Similarly, we have little understanding of how  these  services, once they are used, will affect peoples'  lives.  This  research project capitalizes on an ongoing field  trial  of  residential Internet use that has been developed with  industrial  sponsorship. There are three questions driving the research: What  leads to diffusion and domestication of technology in homes?  How  do  electronic  groups develop? What impact do electronic  groups  have  on  peoples'  social  support, information,  and  household  influence?  The  goal of this NSF-funded project  is  to  address  these questions by developing new measures, designing experiments  and  field  studies, and analyzing data that is  being  collected  from the field trial, focusing on intra-family interactions,  the  development  of electronic groups, and the impact  that  Internet  use has on relations within and among groups.",
