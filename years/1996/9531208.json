 "awd_abstract_narration": "9531208 Ma  This research project aims to advance materials processing of high temperature superconducting oxides.  The objectives are threefold: 1)To characterize the electrical and magnetic properties of high temperature superconductor (HTS) oxides which are systematically implanted with impurity ions of different reactivity.  These results are used to determine optimum implantation conditions for inhibition of superconductivity. 2)To study the structural properties of inhibited materials.  Fundamental effects of ion diffusion, gettering, and channeling on inhibition will be investigated.  3)To realize a reliable fabrication process for single layer and multilayer HTS devices and circuits based on the ion inhibition technique.  Three different approaches to planar multilayer fabrication will be pursued.  Important process related issues will be addressed including patterning resolution, process control, and reliability.  Additionally, several prototype devices including high performance RF coils and superconducting quantum interference devices are expected to be demonstrated during the course of the project. %%% The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level of technological relevance to several aspects of advanced electronic and magnetic devices with relevance to magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) and magnetocardiology.  Additionally, the knowledge and understanding gained from this research project is expected to contribute in a general way to improving the performance of advanced devices and circuits utilizing high temperature superconducting materials by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and processing advanced materials and devices.  An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***",
