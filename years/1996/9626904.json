 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project involves work toward the completion of a booklength  study of the nineteenth-century British mathematician, James Joseph  Sylvester.  The detailed analysis of the various facets of  Sylvester's life and career will result in a rich multilayered look  at mathematics and mathematical culture in the nineteenth century,  a subject and an era fundamental to our intellectual heritage.  The  study's sensitivity to both internalist and externalist issues and  concerns will also serve to unite what C. P. Snow called the \"two  cultures\" of humanists and scientists in a greater mutual  understanding of the nature and role of science in society.    Interactive activities include:  teaching a one-quarter, graduate-  level seminar on the development of American science; participating  in the various seminar series sponsored by the Program on the  Conceptual Foundations of Science and the Morris Fishbein Center  for History of Science and Medicine; mentoring graduate students in  both programs; and organizing a day-long conference in conjunction  with the above-mentioned programs and the Department of Mathematics  on \"The History of Mathematics:  Who Is It For?  How Should It Be  Done?\"",
