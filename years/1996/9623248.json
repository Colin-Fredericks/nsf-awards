Preliminary work has  demonstrated that an applied voltage can be used to control the degree of  Faraday rotation. This effect is novel in the sense that the degree of  rotation is controlled by an electric field as opposed to a magnetic field.  This could lead to electronic control of light switches and wide bandwidth  optical modulators.    Optoelectronic devices based on the Faraday-Stark effect would require only  a low switching voltage (~ volt) and a small dc magnetic field (< l tesla)  supplied by a permanent magnet. Some unique features for optical modulators  include:    * high-bandwidth light modulation, >10^10 Hz;    * very low transmission in the off-state, < 10^-5; and > 40 dB modulation depth;    * compatibility with microlithography and waveguides.    Initial experiments on the Faraday-Stark effect were performed on a GaAs  quantum well sample grown at UC Santa Barbara (group of A.C. Gossard).  Although this structure was not optimized for the Faraday-Stark effect,  improved structures are being grown in the Electrical Engineering  Department at MIT (group of C. Fonstad). Of particular importance for room  temperature devices are structures made from II-VI magnetic semiconductor  structures. These will be grown in our own MBE machine, which was  fabricated with funding from an NSF Engineering Research Grant and seed  funding from AT&T.    A variety of II-VI and III-V material structures will be investigated using  magneto-optical experiments. These results will be helpful in examining the  possibilities for designing devices that operate at wavelengths of  interest. Our ambition is to determine the limitations and optimum  conditions required for optoelectronic light switches, modulators, and  electrically-controlled optical isolators.    This research program will provide students with a broad education in  engineering, physics, and materi als science. It also provides hands-on  training in many areas including optics, magnetism, semiconductors, MBE  crystal growth, microfabrication, low-dimensional science, high-speed  electronics, cryogenics, and high-field magnets. Such a broad-based  education is likely to impact on the future employment of both graduate and  undergraduate students. In addition, an education in the field of optics is  exceptionally valuable since that job market usually exceeds the number of  qualified graduates.  ***",
