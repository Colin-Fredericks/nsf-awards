 "awd_abstract_narration": "9560256  Taylor   The purpose of this SBIR Phase I grant is to construct and test a full size fluid damper using electrorheological (ER) fluid as its operating medium.  The damper can be installed within the frame of a building or bridge to increase the structure's capability to resist earthquake loads.  The damper uses a unique monolithic control valve having no moving parts and using internal flows of the ER fluid.  The valve is electronically activated by a control signal to alter the damping constant of the damper.  When activated, ER fluids radically increase in viscosity, approaching a gel-like state.  This change of state can occur instantaneously and disturbs flow through the control valve, thus greatly increasing the damper's resistance.  This also allows the damper to respond to the extremely broad range of frequencies existing in a structure during a seismic event   This research will allow the active control of building and bridges subjected to earthquakes motions, reducing or eliminating damage during maximum credible seismic motions.  The damping forces dissipate the seismic energy, thus greatly reducing damage to the structure.  Because the required power to operate an ER damper us very low, even conventional batteries become effective sources of control power for massive structures.  Specific structures which will show the greatest improvements are steel frame buildings and reinforced concrete highway bridges.",
