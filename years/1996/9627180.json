 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research centers on d6 polypyridyl assemblies, capable of  serving as catalysts in photoinduced energy conversion schemes.   The assemblies are modeled after the photosynthetic reaction  center, wherein spatial separation of the opposite charged holds  and electrons is used to avoid the \"short circuiting\" recombination  reaction.  Kinetic study of the photoinduced electron transfer in  simple systems, requiring time resolved laser spectroscopy, will  underpin the goal of transferring the holes and electrons across  the assemblies containing novel relay molecules.  The  photochemistry of assemblies containing centers capable of  catalyzing chemical energy conversions will be explored.    Interactive activities focus largely on undergraduates.  A primary  goal is to provide students with maximal personal interaction with  role models.  Interactions include research mentoring and academic  advising, and teaching an enriched section of a general chemistry  course integrated under the theme of \"energy and the environment\".   A variety of prominent women in the sciences will be invited to  serve as additional role models.  A peer womentoring program will  be initiated among the graduate and undergraduate students.  The  latter represent an extensive group of potential role models and  mentors for younger students.",
