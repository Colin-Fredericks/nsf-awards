 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625354  Levi-Setti    Commercial ceramics that are presently available are  generally unsuitable for highly corrosive applications  because they contain corrodible glassy grain boundary  phases. Such phases result from the commercial use of liquid-  phase sintering additives or from poor control of powder  purity and processing. In this project, we are interested  particularly in alumina ceramics and their corrosion  properties in hydrogen fluoride (HF) ambients, with a view  to developing improved materials of construction in the  fluorochemical manufacturing. Corrosion research at DuPont  has led to the discovery that a small amount of MgO (0.05%),  a classic solid-solution sintering aid, improves the  corrosion rate of alumina in HF, even in the presence of  glass-forming impurities. The atomistic mechanism by which  MgO functions is not understood, mainly because its  influence on other cation impurities is not known. The goal  of the proposed collaboration between the University of  Chicago and DuPont is to improve our understanding of the  grain boundary chemistry and its effect on corrosion  behavior, with a view to designing corrosion-resistant  ceramics.  The approach will be to develop fabrication  strategies that eliminate or adjust the nature of glassy  grain boundaries.  The distributions of trace dopants and  impurities in a number of systematically designed alumina  compositions will be studied by high resolution imaging  secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).  %%%  The principal focus of this study is to correlate the grain  boundary chemistry of aluminum oxide to the corrosion  behavior of the bulk material. This information will aid in  the design of commercial ceramic materials that are  resistant to corrosion by a variety of materials.  ***",
