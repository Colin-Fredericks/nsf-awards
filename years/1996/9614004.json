 "awd_abstract_narration": "9614004  Harvell         The project is supported as a high risk, rapid response  project to investigate the causes and consequences of a  disease epidemic in a dominant soft coral (gorgonian) of  Caribbean coral reefs.  An apparent epidemic of unknown  cause is casing widespread but not total mortality in the  genus Gorgonia.  This rapid response award will allow Dr. to  attempt to identify the causes of the disease, the response  of the host gorgonians, and the efforts taken by the host  animal to establish resistance.  Diseases in marine systems  are very hard to investigate, the pathogens are difficult to  separate from secondary infectious organisms and the  chemical mechanisms of resistance are virtually unstudied.  Yet there have been numerous epidemics in dominant marine  species over the past two decades that have fundamental  influences on the underlying ecology of the ecosystem in  which the target host once existed.  This study, while very  high risk, may yield some new insights on disease vectors  and organism adaptations in the marine realm.",
