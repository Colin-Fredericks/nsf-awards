 "awd_abstract_narration": "Regional to global-scale analyses of ecological dynamics is  a crucial research activity for assessing large-scale  phenomena that are relevant to global change. Large-scale  modeling analyses require complex computational technology  and efforts. Both spatial databases and simulation models  are critical components of these analyses. Unfortunately,  most simulation models as well as links with spatial  databases are complicated and used primarily by the  ecologists who developed them. We have identified three  needs that must be met before this technology is readily  accessible to ecologists: (1) user-friendly, portable, and  easily accessible simulation models are needed that can  represent numerous interacting components of ecosystems; (2)  user-friendly models are needed that can represent spatial  processes across spatial scales; and (3) user-friendly  simulation models linked with GIS software are needed. The  overall objective of our proposed work is to address these  needs of the ecological community by developing a modular,  windows-based graphical user-interface (GUI) for four  different kinds of ecological simulation models and the GIS  software, Arc/Info. We propose to build upon and expand a  prototype GUI called EcoVision that we developed under prior  NSF funding. We will expand EcoVision to be user-friendly,  portable, and easily accessible with three functionalities  with different software and hardware requirements: (1) runs  of the 4 models either alone or in linked combination on a  PC; (2) simulation of grids of interacting plots using one  or more models to represent spatial processes on a UNIX  workstation; and (3) simulations for regional analyses on a  UNIX workstation using Arc/Info. Our product will be a menu-  driven, user-friendly GUI that will allow input files and  parameters to be easily selected and changed, and visual  display of input parameters and output variables through  time and space. Multiple graphs will be viewed  simultaneously using input and/or out put from one or more  models. Statistical analyses and on-line user documentation  will also be included within the interface.  We will develop EcoVision for four specific models that can  represent vegetation dynamics of grasslands and shrublands  (STEPPE), nutrient cycling (CENTURY), soil water dynamics  (SOILWAT), and trace gas exchange (NGAS). The models can  either be run alone or linked to allow for interactions and  feedbacks among various components of ecosystems. Spatial  processes are simulated using interacting plots. Using these  four models, we can represent a large portion of the earth's  land resources as well as make important links with Global  Climate Models (GCMs) for global scale predictions of  effects of climate and landuse changes. In addition, our  focus in developing EcoVision will be on generality and  flexibility to allow for additional or different models to  be used. We foresee a large national and international  demand for user-friendly versions of these models and links  with Arc/Info. since a similar product is currently  unavailable. We will work in close collaboration with other  ecologists to ensure that our product will meet the current  and future needs of the ecological community. The software  will be distributed at-cost, and user support will be  provided with a WWW home page.",
