 "awd_abstract_narration": "Formal verification is a technique for reducing certain questions  about the requirements, designs, or implementations of computer  software and hardware to a mathematical form that can examined by  methods having the character of calculation.  Similar to the way in  which questions about the properties of an aerofoil can be reduced to  calculations that can be mechanized by computational fluid dynamics,  mechanized formal verification uses automated theorem proving and  related methods (e.g., model checking) to perform logical  calculations about the properties of computer systems.  Whereas  testing can examine only some of the behaviors of a complex system,  mechanized formal verification can examine all the behaviors of a  model of the system (again, the situation is analogous to flight test  vs. computational fluid dynamics).  Using mechanized formal  verification, suitably realistic models can provide strong evidence  for the correctness of computer systems, and simplified models are  often useful for detecting bugs that testing does not encounter.    Mechanized formal verification is most effective when applied to the  hardest and most critical elements of design.  An area where it holds  great promise is in the analysis of fault-tolerant systems, where the  presence of faults can produce a complexity of behavior that defies  other forms of analysis. The increased assurance provided by  mechanized formal verification can be of particular value for fault-  tolerant systems because these are generally found in applications  that are critical to safety (such as aircraft and other vehicles) or  national infrastructure (such as the telephone, power-distribution,  and banking systems).    The objectives of this research are to reduce mechanized formal  verification of fault-tolerant distributed algorithms from tours-de-  force to routine practice, and to develop a framework for mechanical  verification of the architectures of complete fault-tolerant systems  composed from such algorithms. Th e research focuses on developing  systematic methods for the formal specification of classes of fault-  tolerant algorithms, and mechanized strategies for their exploration  and verification. These strategies will build on techniques that  combine decision procedures and model checking within an interactive  framework.  The algorithms considered will include those for  distributed consensus, synchronization, diagnosis, and group  membership.    The work is expected to yield improved understanding of the  assumptions, constraints, and fault models underlying the algorithms  studied, more refined arguments for their correctness, and coherent  arguments for their synthesis into an overall architecture.  In  addition, the research is expected to yield new results in the  construction and application of formal verification systems, and  improved methods for the formal representation and analysis of fault-  tolerant algorithms.  ***",
