 "awd_abstract_narration": "9527994  PRICE   A long-standing controversy in biology concerns multiple life-history traits that promote survival and reproduction.  Examples of such traits include disease resistance and efficient metabolism of nutrients.  All organisms, including humans, face pressures to do as well as possible.  The question is how such a trait affects other traits.  One theory posits tradeoffs; a life-history trait that increases the fitness of individuals will result in other life-history traits that decrease fitness.  A contrasting theory posits that a life-history trait can augment other life-history traits.  This general question ties together the genetic basis for the physiology of organisms with the consequences of how those organisms function.  It relates early growth and reproduction to later survival and aging.   To understand these traits more detailed knowledge of their genetic basis is required.  This project uses a new technique called Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping to identify genes for life-history traits and longevity in the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster.  Its ease of study allows detailed examination of general questions such as this one, that would be much harder to study in larger organisms.  We will find out whether these genes affect single or multiple life-history traits, and whether genes affecting different life-history traits are close together on the same chromosome.  The results will show whether life-history traits augment or constrain each other, and will lead to an understanding of the physiological and biochemical nature of genetic correlations.",
