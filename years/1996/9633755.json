 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    Davidson  9633755    We propose to conduct workshops to help engineering PhD students interested in becoming faculty members to succeed in their careers.  Each workshop will last one week and will include 30 PhD students selected from a pool of applicants.  Funding is requested for five workshops, one held each summer beginning in July 1996.  The program will include sessions on both education and research.  In the former category, examples of activities include presentations on cognitive processes involved in student learning, interactive discussions on teaching strategies, and exercises to permit workshop participants to develop their own course outlines.  In the latter category, there will be discussions on being an effective advisor to graduate students and on obtaining funding for research.  The workshops will be evaluated using both short-term and long-term assessments through questionaires and interviews.  Overall, the workshops are expected to have a significant effect on the productivity of those faculty members who participate, and on other new faculty members with whom our workshop participants interact.  ***",
