The researchers plan to develop a variety of new, modified starches that can serve as environmentally safe plasticizers and binders in the powder processing of advanced ceramic materials.  By developing a better fundamental understanding of the chemical interactions between ceramic powders and the new starches, the collaborators hope to establish an improved scientific basis for ceramic manufacturing in an industry where Edisonian approaches are typical.    This research in materials research fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.    ***  ??",
