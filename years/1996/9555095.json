 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neurobiology is an emerging interdisciplinary study that  attracts world-wide attention in popular media.  There is  genuine curiosity abroad to understand the dynamic linkage  between one's brain and one's behavior that should be part  of the education, of not only scientists, but the lay  public.  Yet the teaching of neurobiology, especially in a  laboratory setting, has badly lagged the demand.  In part,  this is because of the lack of availability of \"teacher  friendly\" instructional exercises as well as easy  availability of ethically and environmentally acceptable  experimental animals.  This project addresses these problems  by providing teachers of physiology, neuroscience, and  introductory biology, at the college and the high school  level, with a new curriculum of laboratory exercises in  neuroscience.  We are teaching teachers how to use these  exercises in their own labs by: (1) conducting a series of  summer workshops in our teaching laboratory at Cornell; (2)  producing an instructional videotape of our teaching  exercises, aimed at teachers; and (3) setting-up an  electronic bulletin-board service that  permits us to stay  in close contact with any teacher who is using or wants to  use our teaching modules in his/her own laboratory  instruction.  Our teaching labs are based on an integrated  set of classroom-tested labs that use the crayfish as the  experimental animal.  The crayfish is ideal because it is  very hardy and easy to dissect.  In terms of laboratory  logistics, it is cheap, commercial, and easy to maintain.  Pedagogically, the crayfish is ideal because it permits the  instructor to select from simple lab exercises dealing with  fundamental cellular properties of neural tissue to  intellectually stimulating and challenging exercises that  deal with the integrative properties of neural networks,  synaptic computations, and learning and memory.  These  teaching modules thus cover basic neuronal properties, such  as the ionic basis of bioelectric potentials to synaptic   transfusion to elementary forms of learning and synaptic  plasticity.  They take advantage of the fact of the unity of  neural function, the neuronal computations that lead to  behavioral change are similar, whether occurring in the  brain of a crayfish or a college freshman.  The crayfish is  therefore a suitable replacement for vertebrate  preparations, which are becoming controversial as laboratory  subjects.  This project not only provides teachers with a  set of conceptually-rich yet technically simple lab  exercises, but it provides direct instruction to relatively  inexperienced teachers via a \"see and do\" methodology.  The  proposal has two parts.  First, a hands-on workshop for  laboratory instructors at Cornell.  Second, and very  importantly, an instructional videotape for instructors  showing step-by-step how to make each preparation is being  produced.  The intended target of these exercises include  liberal arts college and university teachers, but our  experience tells us that high-school teachers are perfectly  capable of learning and employing these labs in their  classes, and the workshop provides opportunities for them,  as well.  In summary, this proposal seeks to disseminate a  thoroughly tested set of laboratory teaching exercises,  proven to be stimulating to undergraduate students in many  settings, to any teacher who wants to bring neuroscience  content into his/her laboratory.",
