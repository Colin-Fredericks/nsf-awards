 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop an efficient nonlinear optimization  method - NOVEL: Nonlinear Optimization Via External Lead - and the supporting  hardware/software to solve large-scale nonlinear optimization problems in  operations research, digital signal processing, and neural-network learning. Such  a method will allow many important application problems in these areas to be  solved better as well as faster than existing methods. The method first  transforms nonlinear constrained optimization problems using Lagrange multipliers  into unconstrained optimization problems. This transformation allows both  constrained and unconstrained problems to be solved in a unified framework. The  key idea of the method is to use a user-defined trace to pull a search out of a  local optimum (a local saddle point in constrained optimization and a local  minimum in unconstrained optimization) without having to restart it from a new  starting point. The proposed method has a good balance between global search and  local search. In global search, NOVEL relies on two counteracting forces: local  gradient information that drives the search to a local optimum, and a  deterministic trace that leads the search out of a local optimum once it gets  there. The effect of the trace on the search trajectory is expressed in terms of  the distance between the current position of the trajectory and that of the  trace. Good starting points identified in the global-search phase are then  searched more extensively using pure local searches. The proposed research  consists of four aspects: refinement of the NOVEL method, parallel processing,  extension to mixed-nonlinear optimization problems, and applications of the  methods developed to solve problems in operations research, digital signal  processing, and neural-network learning.",
