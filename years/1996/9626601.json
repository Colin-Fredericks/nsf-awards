 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS 96-26601  Eaton          This research involves the evaluation of statistical inferences       which are expressed as data dependent probability distributions.       Inferences of particular interest include both posterior        distributions and predictive distributions which are derived        from improper prior distributions coupled with the formal application       of Bayes Theorem. Questions concerning the admissibility of        inferences have lead to the development of new and powerful       techniques based on a fundamental connection between issues in        statistical decision theory and recurrence/transcience issues       involving symmetric Markov Chains. This fundamental connection is       further developed in this research along with the somewhat allied        noton of strong inconsistency for inferences. Applications of this       research include the evaluation and improvement of inferential       techniques in high dimensional models such as those which arise       in large scale environmental models and those attempting to describe       global change.  %%%       Many problems of statistics, such as those which arise in environmental       studies, involve the simultaneous description and/or simultaneous       prediction of many variables. In such cases, one often speaks of        \"high dimensional problems\". This research involves the construction,       evaluation and comparison of statistical methods which are relevant       in these high dimensional problems. Recent developments have shown       that the problems which arise in this research are, rather surprisingly,       closely connected with certain problems which arise in a seemingly       unrelated area of probability. This connection promises to yield       exciting new insights regarding both practical and theoretical issues       involving high dimensional problems.  ***",
