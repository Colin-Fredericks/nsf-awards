 "awd_abstract_narration": "Insight into the functioning of computer networks is of increasing importance for many students. As an illustration of computer science, a relatively in-depth treatment of the topic of computer networks is also an excellent alternative to the more traditional, breadth-first approach. In this project, the department is developing courseware that provides an introduction to computer networks, to be used in an introductory computer science course for students who are not planning on majoring in computer science. The courseware uses the World Wide Web and consists of Hypertext mark-up language documents and a set of `executable content` applications using the Java programming language. The Java applications use interactive algorithm animation to illustrate key concepts. Highlighted areas include CSMA/CD, Internet protocol routing, TCP error and flow control, cryptography and secure sockets, domain name resolution, and Hypertext telecommunications protocol. The role of each concept in the design of the Web can serve as an organizing theme. With a focus on the key concepts and animated applications, a significant understanding of this material is possible in a course for nonmajors.   The courseware is a major component of the primary course for nonmajors. The audience of the course includes a broad range of students, primarily undergraduates, but with some in-service teachers. Preservice teachers and technology majors form a large fraction of the students. The importance of understanding computer networks for our preservice and in-service teachers and technology majors is a primary factor in the project design.   The courseware can be used in a computer classroom of networked PCs. One situation in which Java applications may be used is in closed student laboratories.",
