 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514675  Boyer      Hibernation   is   an  extreme  adaptation   involving   the  coordination  of  multiple organs  in  lowering  whole  body  temperature  to  conserve energy for an extended  time.  The  PI's  study  hibernating ground squirrels which lower  their  body  temperature  for periods of up to three  weeks  before  they spontaneously rewarm to normal summer body temperatures  for  a  short  period  (< 24 hours).  Following  this  brief  rewarming  period, hibernators return to another three  week  period  of reduced body temperature. This repetitive pattern  of  cooling and rewarming might seem paradoxical,  since  it  requires  the  burning  of a significant  amount  of  stored  calories  throughout  the  hibernation  season,  unless  the  pattern  meets a critical physiological need.  The  proposed  research addresses this phenomenon and represents the  first  comprehensive  analysis  of the temperature  sensitivity  of  gene  expression  in a hibernating mammal.  The  PI's  major  objectives  are  to  (1) identify potential  messenger  RNAs  (mRNAs)  that  become limiting during low body  temperature;  (2) determine the turnover of these mRNAs by measuring their  rate   of  synthesis  and  degradation  as  a  function   of  temperature;  and (3) determine the effect of  reduced  mRNA  concentration  on protein synthesis rate as  a  function  of  temperature.  Comparison  of  the  relative  rates  of  mRNA  synthesis   and  degradation  during  warm  and   low   body  temperatures  will result in a considerable  advancement  in  our   understanding   of  biological  adaptations   to   low  temperature.    This award also includes a teaching component. Most students  are   unskilled  with  the  process  of  scientific  inquiry  including   observation,  inference,  hypothesis  formation,  experimental   design,   data   collection,   analysis   and  interpretation.   To   explain   biological   concepts   and  understand the nature of biology, students must learn how to  think    c ritically,   reason   logically    and    evaluate  technological information effectively by being introduced to  the  methods,  values  and process of conducting  scientific  investigations.   The  educational plan  provides  this  for  students by giving them the opportunity to contribute to  an  ongoing research project focusing on molecular and metabolic  adaptations to hibernation. Students willing to produce  and  follow  an organized research plan should develop  a  deeper  understanding of natural phenomena surrounding them  and  an  appreciation  for the tools of scientific  inquiry  and  the  expansion  of  biological  knowledge.  Concurrent  with  the  proposed   undergraduate  educational  training,   excellent  teaching  assistant opportunities will foster  the  academic  growth  of  graduate students by integrating  education  and  research into their professional development.  Additionally,  critical  thinking skills will also be introduced  into  the  classroom   through  an  inquiry-based  teaching   approach.  Students  will  participate in problem  solving  activities,  debate,   hands-on  demonstrations  and  writing   exercises  involving  local  examples of scientific interest.  Finally,  cooperative  research and teaching interactions  with  rural  high  school teachers are proposed and include sharing ideas  and  experiences  gained  from inquiry-based  teaching,  and  development  of investigative laboratory experiences.  These  collaborative interactions  will  foster  the  establishment of valuable  linkages  with  rural  teachers  and increase the representation  of  Native  Alaskans  and  other  underrepresented  minorities  in   the  biological sciences.",
