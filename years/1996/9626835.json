 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI)  project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,  focusses on the development of a standardized method for preparing  glycoprotein digests for subsequent structure analysis of  carbohydrate side chains using matrix assisted laser desorption  ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS).  This method will permit  structure determinations on samples more than one thousand times  smaller than is now possible and thereby enable analysis of  naturally occurring samples of limited size.  During the tenure of  this three year project, Professor Ronald Orlando and his students  at the University of Georgia will collaborate with industrial  partners at Hewlett Packard to develop this method and the software  with which to analyze the MALDI-MS results.  The data base of  carbohydrate structures that exists at the Complex Carbohydrate  Research Center at the University of Georgia will be used in this  project.        The carbohydrate side chains of mammalian glycoproteins provide  functional control for many life processes.  The determination of  the structures of these side chains in naturally occurring  glycoproteins is limited by the sensitivity of existing methods.   Professor Orlando and his students at the University of Georgia  will collaborate with their industrial partners at Hewlett Packard  in developing a new mass spectrometric method for making these  measurements.  This project will provide a new analytical tool  which can be used to study the function of glycoproteins.",
