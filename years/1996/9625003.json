 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Lee of the   University of Houston will investigate new and versatile approaches to   the preparation of artificial enzymes. The research will focus on the use   of alkanethio units to bind a monolayer of cyclodextrin moieties to a   gold surface. Further, within the cyclodextrin cavity, additional   alkanethio units shall be bonded to the gold surface and used to position   the reactants for enhanced catalytic activity. For the education portion   of the investigation, the principal investigator will facilitate student   understanding of the industrial environment by inviting several lecturers   from the local industries to talk in a new course on `Process Chemistry   and Environmental Aspects of Petrochemistry`. In addition, a second   course will be added on the subject `Chemistry in Context`.  Control of  reaction topology to facilitate a desired reaction is the   main goal of many scientists. This award from the Organic Dynamics   Program addresses this theme by tethering artificial catalytic units to   gold surfaces and using alkanethio units to tune the inner catalytic   environment. The education portion of the award will focus on preparing   undergraduate and graduate students for their post-graduate careers by   introducing two new courses. The first course will teach them how   chemistry is involved in the everyday life and is titled, `Chemistry in   Context`. For the second course, industrial scientists will be invited to   give several lectures and perspectives of industrial careers.",
