 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project details a three-phase plan to integrate technology into the entire mathematics curriculum using the symbolic algebra package, Maple. The first step is the upgrading of an existing calculus lab to a truly interactive electronic classroom. In the second phase, the department plans to weave technology and Maple into the fabric of the upper-level mathematics courses, changing the complexion of these courses from `theorem-proof` to `lab-discovery-discussion-proof.` The final phase introduces a new course for mathematics majors pursuing teaching certification (Mathematics and Technology for Secondary Education). Throughout the curriculum, Maple is being used to simplify computation and as a tool for discovery. Before now, students had used Maple only in the freshman calculus class. After that first year, Maple and all technology have been absent from the curriculum. The success experienced in calculus can be duplicated in all upper-level courses. With the new classroom/lab, the department has the facilities to implement a plan for `computing across the mathematics curriculum.`",
