 "awd_abstract_narration": "9629732  Wagner  This proposal will study the RNA-protein interactions that are involved in mRNA turnover.  A+U-rich elements (ARE) in some mRNAs have been identified as markers for rapid degradation in cell-free systems.  A protein, AUF1, has been found to interact specifically with ARE regions.  The goal of this proposal is to identify polypeptide motifs within the AUF1 protein that are important for ARE-binding activity.  To identify polypeptide motifs that are critical for AUF1-ARE interaction, a powerful combination of mutagenesis and in vitro genetic selection will be employed.  First, linker insertion will be used to create a pool of AUF1 mutant coding sequences containing a substitution of 2-4 amino acids at numerous positions within the wild-type context.  Second, phage display will be used to select AUF1 polypeptides in vitro for their ability to bind ARE sequences.  Clones encoding non-binding mutants present in the input pool will be absent from pools selected for ARE-binding activity.  Regions critical for ARE-binding will be mapped by comparing the positions of linker insertions in the binding versus non-binding phage pools.  DNA isolated from input and selected phage pools can be efficiently screened because the inserted linker will contain a unique KpnI restriction site.  DNA samples will be subjected to unidirectional PCR using a radiolabeled primer that hybridizes to a vector-insert junction at the 5' or 3' end of  the insert.  Digestion of the resulting double-stranded DNA with KpnI followed by denaturing gel electrophoresis and autoradiography will yield a ladder of fragments whose length indicates the position of linker insertion.  Gaps in the ladder(s) of selected phage DNA will indicate positions where linker insertion affects ARE-binding activity.  The relative affinities of  selected vs. non-selected clones for ARE sequences will then be measured by bacterial expression, affinity purification of recombinant protein over Ni 2+-agarose columns and gel shift assays.  The su ccessful completion of these experiments will map critical determinants of AUF1-ARE interaction.  Further, this study will establish a mutagenesis strategy that, when combined with phage display, can be of general use in the study of RNA binding protein-RNA interactions.  %%%  Degradation of mRNA is one mechanism of gene regulation.  An A+U-rich element (ARE) in certain mRNA species has been identified as one marker for mRNA degradation.  A protein that interacts with the ARE sequence (AUF1) has been cloned and characterized.  The goal of this proposal is to identify polypeptide motifs (domains of proteins) that are important for ARE-binding activity.  Experimental strategies will include mutagenesis experiments in which different amino acids will be substituted at different positions in the normal protein to identify relevant stretches of the protein, and phage display methods to select AUF1 polypeptides (fragments of the AUF1 protein) for their ability to bind ARE sequences.  These methods in combination with other state-of-the-art approaches make it highly likely that important structural information on the determinants of AUF1-ARE interaction will be obtained.  ***",
