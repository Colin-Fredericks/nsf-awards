The goal of this project is to advance the state of the art in virtual environment systems by making use of methods of the field of computational geometry and the power of highly parallel computing architectures.  New efficient algorithms are being devised and implemented for critical geometric problems that arise in virtual environments and three-dimensional simulations, including collision detection, visibility/visualization, and mesh simplification.  A prototype software system is being written, incorporating new algorithms (sequential and parallel), and a library of efficient code for geometric primitives.  Special attention is being given to robustness and efficiency issues of the algorithms and implementations.  The impact of the project will be to advance the state of the art in virtual environment simulations, by increasing the complexity of the models that can be handled in real time.  ***",
