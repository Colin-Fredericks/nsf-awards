 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Rotello of the   University of Massachusetts-Amherst will investigate non-covalent bonding   factors that influence the redox properties of flavoenzymes. For this   investigation the principal investigator has prepared artificial binding   sites which mimic the natural sites, but allow him to quantify the   individual factors that are believed to affect the redox properties. The   two major factors which are considered important are hydrogen bonding and   pi stacking. Preliminary evidence suggests that the project will be   successful.  Understanding the details of enzymatic processes will provide scientists   with the knowledge to modify paradigms and procedures for improved   therapeutic drug efficacy. This project from a young investigator, if   successful, will provide needed information on how flavoenzymes function.   Since these enzymes are essential physiological moieties, this research   has significant potential in the health related domain. These results may   be useful to a broader scope of redox systems that are germane to organic   materials and electronic devices.",
