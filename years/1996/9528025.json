 "awd_abstract_narration": "9528025  MILLER   The island of New Guinea has a complex geologic history.  It apparently has been formed over time by the northern edge of the Australian continental mass enlarging as it collided with elements of southward migrating island arcs.  This repeating process of slow tectonic crashing of land masses has formed upthrusts of mountain ranges on New Guinea.  Present day plants and animals endemic to these ranges and adjacent island arcs include amazing biodiversity, much of it undescribed, and provide information for biogeographic analyses that divulge the geologic history of the timing and pattern of these land mass movements.  This award provides continuing support for a project involving the aquatic Hemiptera (true bugs) (Insecta: Hemiptera) of New Guinea and adjacent island arcs as a key group for investigating the biogeographic consequences of such island arc migration and accretion.  Support from a prior NSF award has resulted in excellent productivity with 27 genera (11 new and in five families) having been analyzed completely and 2 others in part.  This award will support further analysis of 13 additional genera in eight families.  Distributional data for these taxa will be utilized in biogeographic analyses to enhance knowledge of the zoogeography of this fascinating region.      This project will contribute to our knowledge of the biodiversity of New Guinea.  Specifically, new insect taxa will be described and their relationships studied for understanding of the historical biogeography of New Guinea and related island arcs.  Aquatic insect studies are especially important because these organisms are important indicator taxa for monitoring water quality.",
