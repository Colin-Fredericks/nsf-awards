 "awd_abstract_narration": "9627160  WALDEN              In 1996 Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will operate the  Deep Submergence Vessel ALVIN.  The submersible is certified for a  depth of 4,500M and is designated a national asset.  The ALVIN is  supported by the research vessel ATLANTIS II (AII).  Both vehicles  have been operated effectively and safely by the institute for a  wide variety of NSF-sponsored research projects.  Through a  Memorandum of Agreement between ONR, NOAA and NSF the submersible  is operated in support of projects funded by these agencies.           The 1996 schedule for ALVIN is lighter than the vessel is  capable of performing with a projected operational schedule of 161  days.  Of these days 123 are proposed to support NSF-sponsored  programs.  NSF-supported cruises will take place in both the  Atlantic and Pacific in support of biological and marine geological  and geophysical research.         The ALVIN schedule is light due to the ABS and Navy  requirements for a major overhaul and recertification being  scheduled in 1996 for the DSV.  This overhaul normally requires  approximately 6 to 8 months to complete.  Since it will be a light  year for the submersible the use of remotely operated vehicles  (ROV's) will be used to provide deep submergence access to the  community.  Three cruises are scheduled for the WHOI DS/ROV's.  Two  of these cruises will be in the Pacific and one in the Atlantic.  ***",
