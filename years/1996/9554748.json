 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem this project addresses is the \"quantitative reasoning  gap\" that has been widely recognized among undergraduate social  science majors.  The objectives are to (1) introduce more \"science\"  into the social sciences at the early undergraduate level; (2) make  quantitative reasoning skills accessible to social science majors  by showing their relevance to social issues in an active learning  setting; (3) prepare students for applied upper level courses and  careers that utilize these skills.  The methods are implementation  of both traditional in-person workshops and a \"virtual\" -- Internet  -- accessible workshop that will enable social science faculty at  two and four year colleges to exchange data and ideas toward  introducing analysis of U.S. Census data in their classes.  This  project will have impact beyond that in the project period, since  the virtual workshop, along with an Internet-accessible library of  exercises, will be self-sustaining after the conclusion of the  project period.  In addition to faculty generally at two and four  year institutions, the special audiences addressed are minority and  disabled faculty, as well as faculty from two-year undergraduate  institutions and other institutions that provide little or no  financial support for involvement in such activities.  This  proposal builds on a Department of Education-funded (FIPSE)  collaboration between the University of Michigan Population Studies  Center (PSC) and a network of 12 colleges of the Great Lakes  Colleges Association (GLCA).  This existing FIPSE project  demonstrates the feasibility of incorporating interactive U.S.  Census data analysis via the Internet into existing undergraduate  curricula.  This proposal to NSF extends to a national community of  social science instructors an approach to sharing curricular  materials and interactive networking capabilities.",
