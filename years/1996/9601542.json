 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major goal of this project is the study of how deaf  children who use American Sign Language (ASL) acquire competence  in English, a language that differs from their first in modality.  Toward this goal, the project seeks to explore whether and how  putatively English forms in everyday use of ASL might be a source  of reading development. These forms include fingerspelling, a  system of manually representing print words in English, as well  as other signed forms related to fingerspelling such as  initialized signs, loan signs and hybrid sign-fingerspelled  compounds. The latter forms are categorized Foreign vocabulary,  to distinguish them from the larger Native vocabulary of ASL  which derives from gestural sources. The project will undertake a  linguistic description of a variety of Foreign forms through  studies with native adult signers. In addition, the project will  study use of these forms by young native and nonnative signers  whose competence in English is emerging. This two-pronged  approach will accomplish both a broader description of the ASL  lexicon and a broader description of language competence in  signing deaf children.       There are at least three important outcomes to this project:  ( 1 ) an expansion of our understanding of sign languages to  include vocabulary deriving from representational systems such as  fingerspelling which exist not only in ASL but in a great many  other sign languages; (2) understanding the role of  representational systems in signing deaf children's acquisition  of a language; that does not share the modality of their first  language and (3) a broader account of reading ability in deaf  children.",
