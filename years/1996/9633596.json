 "awd_abstract_narration": "9633596  Ludwig    While much progress has been made in understanding  equilibrium phase diagrams, transformation kinetics has been  more difficult to calculate or simulate with quantitative  accuracy.  This is particularly true when there are  complicating factors such as long-period superlattice phases  and coupling between strain and ordering.  By combining  synchrotron-based-time-resolved x-ray scattering  capabilities with recently-developed binding energy  calculations and supercomputer technology significant  advances can be made.  State-of-the-art energy calculations  in Monte-Carlo simulations are used to understand, and  predict, complex ordering kinetics as observed by time-  resolved x-ray diffraction.  The calculations allow for  local relaxation of atoms off their ideal lattice sites as  well as global lattice relaxation and symmetry change.  The  focus is on the classic CuAu alloy, which possesses ordered  and modulated phases as well as a lattice symmetry change  upon ordering.  Other important issues to be investigated  include the presence of separate ordering spinodals for  modulated and ordered phases, formation kinetics of the  ordered phase from the modulated phase, and the coupling  between strain and order.  In addition to CuAu alloys, other  systems which exhibit long-period superlattice phases will  be investigated, in particular Ti-Al alloys which exhibit a  devil's staircase of modulated phases.  %%%  Ordering kinetics in many alloys is complicated by the  presence of long-range superlattice phases and/or changes in  lattice constant and symmetry.  Understanding the changes in  such systems is a major challenge to materials scientists.  ***",
