The spring of 1996 will mark the  first time this Workshop has ever convened in the United States.   All previous meeting have been held in Europe (with the exception  of Kathmandu in 1994) and therefore many North American workers  have found it difficult to attend and meet their European and Asian  colleagues.  Recently, excellent advances have been made by  American workers in Himalayan and Tibetan geosciences. To continue  this cutting-edge work, it is essential that we open all lines of  communication and collaboration with Asian and European  researchers.  In addition to covering various geological segments  of the Himalaya (i.e., the Indus-Tsangpo Suture Zone, the Tethyan  Himalaya, the Higher Himalayan Crystallines, the Lesser Himalaya,  and the Subhimalayan foreland), the Workshop will also organize  three special sessions:  Geodynamic models of the Himalaya and  Tibet; the Neotectonics and Quaternary Geology of the Himalaya and  Tibet; and Extensional tectonics in a compressional orogen, all of  which are subjects of much debate currently.  ***",
