 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address a novel approach for improving the efficiency of net shape forming operations.  In particular, it would benefit Powder Metal (PM) processing in the costly area of post finishing operations for PM parts.  These operations contribute significantly to the overall part cost.  Elimination or reduction of post finishing operations would have a significant impact on PM processing economics.  Phase I will develop a process based on the application of electric field energy to enhance the surface finish of PM parts during the sintering operation.  The technique appears to improve surface finish by reducing surface porosity.  The Phase I effort will focus on determining the optimum conditions under which Electric Field Sintering (EFS) can improve PM surface finishes.       Commercial application of EFS equipment focuses on PM sintering operations by metal powder and parts producers.  In addition, manufacture of high performance transmission gears is one of several other fields of potential application.",
