 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project Professor Kuppermann of the California Institute of   Technology is being supported by the Theoretical and Computational   Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division.  The project involves the   study of electronic non-adiabatic effects in state-to-state chemical   reaction dynamics.  The primary reaction used is the hydrogen exchange   reaction between H + H2 and various isotopic variants.   Other reactions   considered include the reaction of F + H2, as well as O + H2.  Various   ways of treating and incorporating multiple electronic surfaces and   non-adiabatic effects will be investigated.  Considerable use is being   made of massively parallel supercomputers.   Special attention is being   placed on the role of the `geometric phase` in influencing the reaction   probabilities for such reactions.    Elementary bimolecular chemical reactions are the basic steps of complex   technologically important chemical systems, such as combustion processes,   atmospheric chemistry, chemical lasers, and plasma reactors.  These   systems may involve many steps whose reagents are very frequently   short-lived and in many instances cannot be isolated experimentally.     Studying their cross sections and rates theoretically constitutes in such   cases the best, if not the only, available approach.  Such studies also   elucidate their molecular level details and lead to a fundamental   understanding of how they occur.   The theoretical description of very   simple gas-phase chemical reactions such as  those between a hydrogen   atom and a hydrogen molecule, and oxygen atom and hydrogen molecule are   being advanced in this computational study which makes use of massively   parallel computers.",
