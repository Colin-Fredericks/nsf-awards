 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shen  9623020       The investigator develops fast algorithms and robust  software for elliptic problems and constructs, analyzes, and  implements fast and accurate schemes for numerical simulation of  unsteady incompressible flows.  The numerical simulation of  incompressible flows, which plays an important role in numerous  scientific and industrial applications of current interest, is a  challenging task for both numerical analysts and computational  dynamicists.  The proposed fast algorithms are based on the  spectral discretization for the space variables and high-order  projection schemes for the time variable.  The proposed algorithms  allow accurate numerical simulation of incompressible flows with  significantly less computational effort than the traditional  lower-order methods.       Fast and accurate numerical solution of partial differential  equations is of major importance in many fields of science and  engineering, including among others high performance computing,  turbulence modeling and numerical weather prediction.  A main  objective of this project is to develop fast algorithms with  optimal computational complexity for a large class of elliptic  equations, and to implement them in a high performance software  package that is made available to the public through anonymous  ftp and World Wide Web.  It is expected that the proposed fast  algorithms and software will become an important tool for many  scientists and engineers.",
