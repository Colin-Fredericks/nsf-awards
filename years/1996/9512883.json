 "awd_abstract_narration": "A core facility will be established to assist in the formatting of  assays to score genetic markers in a large number of progeny. Funds for  an Perkin Elmer LS5OB fluorometer are being requested that in  conjunction with existing equipment in the Analytical Chemistry and  Peptide/DNA Synthesis Facility will serve the needs of the  collaborating Users. The facility will be unique in providing the User  access to state-of-the-art technology for marker screening. A core  technology to be explored is a multi plex PCR allelic discrimination  assay (TaqManTM recently developed by Perkin Elmer/ Applied Biosystems  Division and demonstrated useful in a number of applications by the Pl.  The PE LS50B will be used to establish a capability in designing and  formatting TaqManTM assays to score for existing and newly discovered  markers. This technology is a robust, quantitative PCR-based assay that  can be applied to marker identification or allelic discrimination  assays. It can be used to screen literally hundreds of samples with  either qualitative or quantitative readouts. An integral need in both  of these techniques is an oligonucleotide synthesis facility capable of  phosphoramidite chemistry and oligonucleotide analysis. The  collaborating scientists have as their common focus the identification  and usage of genetic markers to assist in the selection of progeny.  Individual efforts range from marker assisted selection of  agronomically valuable traits (biochemical pathways, disease  resistance) in plants to genotyping cattle for alleles linked to  superior milk production. This facility will enhance existing expertise  and make available state-of-the-art equipment for carrying out these  studies. It will complement existing programs by establishing a core  facility with equipment beyond the funds currently at the disposal of  any single investigator or collectively through pooling their  resources. Results from this effort will, through their publication in  the public domain further the know ledge base in a variety of  applications of marker assisted selection. Further the equipment will  help enhance the educational mission of the university both through  traditional training of graduate students as well as special workshops  offerings. The PE LS50B will be housed in the Analytical Chemistry and  Peptide/DNA Synthesis Facility, maintained through an existing  supervisory structure and operated with the assistance of an existing  technical staff .",
