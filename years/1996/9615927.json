 "awd_abstract_narration": "USC/ISI will create and maintain TRAIL, Testbed Routers for Advanced  Internet Labs.  The TRAIL software will be a freely available, well  maintained, community research router source, featuring IPv6 in particular.  The work will extend and leverage developments and facilities of the  Collaborative Advanced Interagency Research Network (CAIRN), organized by  ISI under current DARPA funding.  CAIRN is a T1, DS-3 and OC-3 wide area  router testbed.    The software is for two classes of hardware: 1) high performance but  low-cost personal computers, supporting small numbers of router interfaces  and  2) specialized router hardware, supporting the large numbers of  interfaces that are characteristic of internet interconnect points, and  providing a realistic experimental model of commercial IP routing  technology.    For the second class of hardware, one vendor who supports such numbers of  high-speed interfaces proved interested in donating full source code to be  used as the base of TRAIL.  Therefore, the second class of hardware for  TRAIL is the Ascend/Netstar, Gigarouter.  It supports 32 OC-3 ATM ports, or  combinations of ATM ports with 16 to 128 fast ethernet ports.    The proposal focuses strongly on support of experimental users.  ISI's care  will be devoted to supporting their software, and maintaining and  distributing versions for PC alone, and for PC along with Gigarouter. ISI  will also maintain facilities for IPv6 networking research collaboration,  and coordinate the North American portion of the experimental IPv6  backbone, the \"6bone\".",
