 "awd_abstract_narration": "9526659  Hodges       The process of extensional deformation within orogenic  belts is of considerable interest in the development of  collisional mountain ranges.  First well-documented in the  Himalaya, these extensional structures appear to provide a  mechanism for limiting the topographic relief and mean  elevation when physical erosion is not sufficient to  compensate for the compression-drives uplift.  Commonly  associated with these extensional features is an enigmatic  metamorphic relationship in which the metamorphic grade is  inverted, that is, increases upward.  From thermal modeling  it is clear that these inverted metamorphic gradients can  only be preserved with rapid cooling.   However, the  temporal spatial and mechanical relationships between  deformation (compression with extensional unroofing  accommodation) and the geothermal budget (Metamorphic grade  and pressure-temperature-time path) of these systems is not  well understood.  This project will study tectonic  denudation and inverted metamorphism in the East Greenland  Caledonides.   This area exposes a much deeper part of an  Orogen, and the inverted metamorphic gradient is present in  a different structural setting from analogous structures in  the Himalaya.  Technically, the high-precision  geochronologic techniques to be used are capable of more  closely tying deformation metamorphism in this older orogen.  The expected results of this research include a better  understanding of the thermal behavior of actively deforming  orogens, particularly in response to episode of extension in  the overall compressional orogens.",
