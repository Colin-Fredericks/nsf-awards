 "awd_abstract_narration": "Balachandar  9622889       The investigator and his colleague develop numerical methods  to study problems of mantle convection.  The main thrust of this  collaborative effort between the areas of computational  mathematics, fluid dynamics and geophysics is investigating a  class of challenging problems in mantle dynamics, which involves  the application of several modern mathematical and computational  techniques to large-scale numerical simulation, data-processing,  and scientific visualization.  The geophysical problems they  investigate entail the exploration of convection in the high  Rayleigh number regime.  Particular interest is in the  investigation of various transitions the flow undergoes under  non-equilibrium conditions as the system evolves from its initial  state of very high Rayleigh number and as the convective vigor of  the system decreases over time due to cooling.  Among these  transitions are (1) the flush instabilities induced by phase  transitions, and (2) the appearance of enhanced toroidal surface  velocity fields in variable viscosity three-dimensional  convection.  A large eddy simulation methodology is developed and  implemented to accurately simulate the very high Rayleigh number  complex dynamics of the young Earth.  Mathematical tools that the  investigators develop, adapt and employ in these problems include  iterative techniques based on Krylov subspace for treating the  variable viscosity convection in the context of spectral  transform method, domain decomposition methodology for efficient  spatial resolution, and proper orthogonal decomposition and  wavelet transform techniques for efficient post-processing of the  results.       An important question that has arisen in the last few years  is the possibility of global gravitational instability that  develops in the Earth's interior due to internal phase  transition.  This instability results in episodic eruption of  superplumes from the lower mantle and associated intense volcanic  activity at the surface.  Th ere are increasing evidences from  correlation between past trench sites and cold anomalies in the  lower mantle, inferred from seismic tomography, that such  instabilities on global scale could have occurred in the past 100  million years.  This provides a possible explanation for the  extinction of the dinosaurs, but there are many aspects of this  gravitational instability still needs to be explored.  Recent  large-scale high performance simulations have also revealed that  localized patches of concentrated shear and rotation about a  vertical axis can be generated with variable viscosity under  vigorous convection.  This is an important step towards a  self-consistent explanation of the interaction between the  surface plates and mantle.  This project extends these recent  findings under idealized equilibrium conditions to more realistic  non-equilibrium conditions, as the vigorously convecting young  Earth cools over time.  Incorporation of modern numerical  techniques and recent developments in mathematical methods are  essential for the successful investigation of these complex  phenomena.  Finally, it is of interest to investigate what the  effects of these instabilities are on the long-term thermal  evolution of the Earth and Earth-like planets.",
