 "awd_abstract_narration": "9527357  DeFotis    This proposal is concerned with the detailed study of  magnetic behavior, especially that associated with magnetic  phase transitions, of a number of unusual pure, dilute and  mixed magnetic systems with short- range exchange  interactions. The pure materials are interesting because  four of them are members of a new family of 3d transition  metal dichloride monohydrates in two of which spin glass-  like behavior has already been observed; another is  ferromagnetic and a potential member of the rare  universality class; and two others exhibit remarkably large  zero-field splittings. The study of spin glass behavior in  insulating materials is of particular interest and  importance, and several of the mixed magnetic systems to be  studied could exhibit spin glass phases. One of these is a  potential three-dimensional XY insulating spin glass. The  behavior of a 3D-XY ferromagnet with dilution is itself an  important problem. Two of the mixed systems are ternary in  character, i.e, they contain either three different magnetic  components or two magnetic and one diamagnetic. Such systems  are virtually unstudied among insulating materials. The  mixed magnets will contain either competing exchange  interactions, competing anisotropies, different spin values,  or some combination of these. Determination of magnetic  phase diagrams, showing the dependence of ordering  temperature on composition and regions of phase stability,  is a major objective of this work. Certain theoretically  predicted phase diagram types are yet to be observed.  %%%  This research include a detailed study of magnetic behavior  of a number of unusual pure, dilute and mixed magnetic  systems with short- range exchange interactions. The pure  materials are interesting because certain members exhibit  spin glass-like behavior, are ferromagnetic, or they exhibit  remarkably large zero-field splittings. A variety of systems  are proposed for study because several different phenomena  are of interest. Experimenta l methodology consists primarily  of variable temperature, variable field magnetization  measurements, on polycrystalline and single crystal samples.  Collaborative work also is planned for neutron diffraction  and scattering, high field magnetization, and very long time  thermoremanent magnetization measurements. The proposed work  will have a major impact on the departmental research  environment, especially in opportunities afforded  undergraduates for research during the summer and during the  academic year. Such experience is a critical part of their  scientific education, and valuable preparation for later  scientific work.",
