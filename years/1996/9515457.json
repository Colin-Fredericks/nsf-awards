 "awd_abstract_narration": "9515457  Vignale      This award supports the participation of twelve American   researchers at a workshop entitled \"Electron Density Functional  Theory: Recent Progress and New Directions\" to be held in  Brisbane, Australia between July 15 and 19, 1996.  The American  organizer for this workshop is Dr. Giovanni Vignale of the  Department of Physics, University of Missouri - Columbia.  The Australian organizer is Dr. John Dobson of the Faculty of  Science and Technology at Griffith University, Nathan,  Queensland.    Electron Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a theoretical /  computational tool used by solid state physicists and engineers  to predict materials properties and to model electronic and  optical devices.  Chemists and biologists also use DFT for  molecular modelling.  The objectives of the workshop are to  acquaint energy transfer researchers with the current state of  theoretical and experimental knowledge in dealing with large and  small molecular systems, to identify experiments and theoretical  developments which may have the greatest impact on advancing  knowledge about large molecular vibrational energy transfer, and  to foster further collaboration and communication between  American and Australian investigators in this research area.  A  few selected participants will come from Canada, France and  Germany.         Australian support for this workshop is provided through the  Australian Department of Industry, Science and Tourism (DIST)  under the U.S.-Australia Cooperative Science Program.",
