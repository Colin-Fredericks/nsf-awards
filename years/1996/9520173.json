To accomplish this it is necessary  to  describe  the  microstructure in quantitative terms; accordingly,  image   analysis  systems  and  the  interpretation  of  acquired  microstructural information are examined to numerically  describe  microstructural   assemblies.   A   majority   of   metal   alloy  microstructures,  such as those derived from  solidification  and  casting, are not easily described in terms of Euclidean geometry.  For  these  cases  fractal  analysis  can  be  employed  to  make  numerical statements about the microstructure, however chaotic it  may  be.   The  feasibility of this approach has been  shown  for  distributions  of  graphite in graphitic cast  irons  and  should  apply to many other complex microstructures which presently  defy  quantitative  numerical assessment.  The research involves  model  alloy systems and actual industrial products, starting with  cast  irons and aluminum-based engine castings.  Ford Motor Company and  General  Motors Corporation  view this research as  an  important  area  of pre-competitive technology and are providing significant  contributions to the program.  %%%  While   this   program  is  academically  stimulating,   it   has  considerable  industrial potential for predictive  automation  of  manufacturing processes.  ***",
