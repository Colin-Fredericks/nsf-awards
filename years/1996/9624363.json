 "awd_abstract_narration": "9624363  Chen   This Career Award provides support for research on developing a design system, called the Concept Exploration System (CES), for configuring complex systems at the early stages of design.  The CES can be used to quickly evaluate the design concepts and determine the top-level design specifications for those systems that require a large investment of resources, have long life cycles, have small production runs and are generally made-to-order.  Examples of such systems are aircraft, automobiles, launch vehicles, ships, and electric power generation plants.  The foundation of this research is the development of the Robust Concept Exploration Method which is an integrated design process that allows for decision making with quality consideration.  The key feature of this method is to integrate the robust design techniques, Suh's design axioms, and the Response Surface Methodology within the framework of the Compromise Decision Support Problem (a mathematical construct for formulating multi-objective design problems involving tradeoffs).  Educational focal points are to (1) orchestrate learning from a systems perspective in the undergraduate design education, (2) introduce quality engineering concepts and statistical methods in the graduate design curricula, and (3) encourage undergraduate student involvement with the research programs.   Because of growing costs and globalization of the marketplace, improvements in productivity require a reliable design in the shortest possible time.  In general, most design automation techniques have concentrated on relatively later design phases but little has been done to provide assistance in the early stages of design.  The development of this research will provide a prototypical tool that can be used by designers to do better in this area of design and ultimately enhance the competitiveness of American industry.  Successful implementation of the research is expected to affect the science and technology base in providing the capability of handling  design problems with a magnitude of complexity, reducing the risks of using uncertain information, facilitating continuous improvement, and assisting Concurrent Engineering and Multidisciplinary Optimization.",
