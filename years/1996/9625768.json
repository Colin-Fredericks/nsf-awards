 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625768  Beilinson       The project deals with a geometric version of Langlands' correspondence  in which the role of automorphic forms is played by D-modules on the moduli  space of principal bundles on a complex curve, and that of Galois  representations, by the local systems on the curve.  It appears that the  theory of chiral algebras provides a powerful method for constructing  the 'automorphic forms' corresponding to the 'Galois representations,'  which may eventually lead to complete understanding of the Langlands  conjectures in the geometric situation.       The Langlands conjectures appear to be among the deepest visions  of modern number theory; at the moment there seems to be no clue to  understanding them in full generality.  However, the parallel  statements in the geometric situation (technically, with the number  field replaced by the field of rational functions on a complex curve)  seem to be much more manageable, because of the machinery of chiral  algebras (originated in mathematical physics).  These parallel  statements are to be addressed in this project.  ***",
