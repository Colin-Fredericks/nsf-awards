Meral Ozsoyoglu    Case Western Reserve University    Presentation Languages in Multimedia Databases     Multimedia presentation refers to the concurrent presentation of multimedia data using monitors for text, video or still images, and  speakers for audio.  Each presentation contains multimedia segments retrieved from a database, and is constructed and played out by a presentation manager software. This research has three components.  (a) A prototype system is developed to automate the assembly of presentations from multimedia databases for beginning computer users.  The system is then revised and evaluated in different application domains. One example is a Course-Assistant software in education.   (b) A presentation construction language for intermediate computer users is implemented and evaluated in different application domains.  The language provides control on the number and contents of concurrent segments in a presentation, and has the ability to specify playout-time changes in a presentation, and communication and synchronization among multiple playout managers.  (c) For advanced users, a presentation manipulation language is developed and evaluated.     The development is carried out on multimedia personal computers  with MPEG capture and playout capabilities and on workstations,  acquired by the instrumentation grant. The development platforms  are Windows NT and UNIX.",
