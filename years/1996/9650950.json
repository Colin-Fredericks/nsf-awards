 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a laboratory program in environmental health and environmental chemistry using an electron capture detector, a capillary conversion kit to convert a Hewlett-Packard Model 5880A (HP-5880A) gas chromatograph equipped with dual flame ionization detector, and ancillary data acquisition board and  chromatographic software.  This equipment  will greatly expand the scope of the laboratory experiences available to undergraduate environmental health science and chemistry students, and will enable the university to better assist high school science teachers. A number of laboratory courses will be modified in order to make use of the requested enhancements to the HP-5880A: Practicum in Environmental Health, Environmental Measurement, Introduction to Research Techniques in Chemistry, Instrumental Methods of Analysis, Introduction to Research in Chemistry. This resource will be made available to colleagues and students from other graduate programs at Indiana State University (ISU). In addition, we will prepare a laboratory manual that will be used at ISU and made available to others upon request. In addition, selected high school students and their teachers will be given an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with the analysis of environmental samples.",
