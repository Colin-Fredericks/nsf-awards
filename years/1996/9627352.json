The meeting focuses on progress in optical  imaging which depends crucially on progress in a number of  disciplines.  Moreover, various techniques need to be judged in the  light of competing methods and sharpened with the knowledge of  progress of allied methods.  For example, imaging with light and  with near infrared radiation may soon lead to important new  modalities for medical imaging and diagnosis of the brain or breast  diseases.  Several time resolved, frequency modulation, coherence,  speckle and inverse techniques are now being developed to  characterize the key properties of tissues that are associated with  variations in the absorption and scattering cross sections.  Use is  made of coherent backscattering, ballistic and early arriving  light, ultrafast pulse techniques and spatial filtering, spectral  dynamics, time-resolved holography, interference and coherence of  nonlinear optical phenomena, and phase modulation approaches.  The  funds requested from the NSF are to support travel to the  conference of outstanding graduate students, post doctoral fellows  and junior faculty.  This is the second conference in this series.   The first conference served as the touchstone for the progress of  the field.  It represented a clear statement of the state of the  art of the time and played an important role in defining the  challenges ahead.  ***",
