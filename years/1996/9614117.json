 "awd_abstract_narration": "This starter grant award to Columbia University supports the research of   Professor James L. Leighton.  The research targets the development of a   new class of chiral Lewis acid catalysts for the addition of a wide range   of nucleophiles to any aldehyde.  Hetero-bimetallic chiral Lewis acids   are designed and synthesized that simultaneously employ two binding   elements, a simultaneous sigma and pi binding, to control the addition of   nucleophiles to aldehydes.  Following synthesis of the catalysts, their   complexation reactions are studied in detail and the complexes fully   characterized spectroscopically.  The catalytic properties are optimized   by examination of various bimetal combinations.  The research impacts the field of asymmetric catalysis in a practical   way, in that new catalysts are made available for the asymmetric   synthesis of small organic molecules. In addition, the studies address   fundamental mechanistic questions about the nature of pi-bound   aldehyde-metal complexes.",
