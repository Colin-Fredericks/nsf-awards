 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Princeton experimental program is centered on  measurements of the angular distribution of the thermal  cosmic background radiation (the CBR) and its spectrum and  absolute temperature.  These are a proving ground for  scenarios of galaxy formation; if the scenario is simple we  may find encoded in the angular distribution the values of  key cosmological parameters.  The spectrum at wavelengths  greater than about 3 cm should be better explored to improve  constraints on the history of interactions of matter and  radiation.  This group's measurements from Saskatoon detect  the power spectrum of irregularities in the CBR on angular  scales from about 0.5 to 3.  They will improve these  detections with their ground-based telescope and to build a  balloon-borne instrument that produces a map of the  anisotropy.  Better measurements of the CBR anisotropy  require more sensitive and stable detectors and radiometers.  They will build and test a new 90 Ghz HEMT-based (High  Electron Mobility Transistor) radiometer and to develop a  small array of broad-band SIS receivers for   90 Ghz.  They  will also continue developing the techniques to search for  long-wavelength distortions in the spectrum.    The objective of this research is to advance knowledge,  through both theory and experiment, of the evolution and  large-scale structure of the universe.  New telescopes and  improvements in detector sensitivities over a broad range of  energies have yielded a much enlarged fund of data that  confront a multitude of options within the standard  cosmological model.  The Princeton group expects that within  a decade additions to the data and a careful evaluation of  the theoretical options the data allow will yield a new test  of general relativity theory, and, through an improved check  of consistency of the cosmological model, will sharply  restrict models for the formation of galaxies and their  large-scale distribution, and perhaps tell us whether the  universe is open or closed.  Education is central t o this  research.  The group places a strong emphasis on  undergraduate teaching; on average, the group supervises six  undergraduates each summer and ten independent research  projects during the school year.  Though many go on in  physics, quite a few continue their education in medicine,  engineering, or law.  Educating graduate students also has  high priority.",
