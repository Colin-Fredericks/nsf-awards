 "awd_abstract_narration": "9633230  Mayer    A pore protection hypothesis will be tested, provide a mechanistic  basis for the observed patterns of organic carbon. Relationships  between organic matter and mineral surfaces will be developed by:    (1) Assessing the extent of organic matter coverage on mineral  grains. Is organic carbon localized in small areas or is it widely  dispersed? Wide dispersal implies that major fraction must reside  in small pores.  This question will be tested by completing  development of a promising new method based on the   of gas  adsorption onto mineral surfaces.  Completion work will focus on  the nature of naked mineral surfaces, identifying variations that  derive from mineralogy, microtopography, and source area;  (2) Determining if natural organic matter resides preferentially  inside small mesopores, by careful examination of the effects of  removal of organic coatings on the size distribution of pores. This  test will also involve the reverse process of adding artificial  organic coatings to uncoated mineral grains, providing insight into  the localization and mechanism of organic matter sorption.  (3) Testing if these small mesopores on mineral grains can indeed  exclude hydrolytic enzymes, by performing a series of size-  exclusion and adsorption experiments.    These approaches will be carried out on a wide variety of sediments  from around the world. In addition to testing the pore hypothesis,  results from this project will have important implications for  carbon cycling, mineral-water interactions, and pollutant cycling.",
