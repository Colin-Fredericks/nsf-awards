Led  by Bradley Plohr of SUNY Stony Brook and Dan Marchesin of  Instituto de Matematica Pura e Aplicada (IMPA) in Brazil, a  group of 6 to 10 U.S. scientists and as many Brazilian  scientists will collaborate on these problems.  Several  graduate students in each country will also be involved in  the endeavor.      The project is both international and interdisciplinary,  bringing together mathematicians, physicists, doctors, and  engineers in two countries.  Building on established  collaborations, new avenues of research including new  investigators will be opened.  An established emphasis on  development of graduate students will also be continued.      ***",
