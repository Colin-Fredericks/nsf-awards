 "awd_abstract_narration": "The eighth grade is an important point in a girl's education,  particularly in deciding whether or not to follow a science and  mathematics track.  In order to promote interest and aptitude in  science and engineering, we propose an innovated program that  involves eighth grade girls with their mentors (preferable the  mother or a female teacher from their school).  They will be part  of an engineering team that includes a Tufts faculty member, a  Tufts undergraduate, a Tufts staff member, and a staff member from  the Acton Discovery Museum.  Five teams will work on developing  actual hands-on science-museum exhibits.  Each exhibit will focus  on a specific science/engineering principle that will be explored  during the initial phase of the project in a supportive and fun  learning environment.  The exhibits will link together with other  exhibits following a thematic approach, and will use discovery  learning activity-based learning to teach people about science and  engineering principles.  These exhibits will be displayed at the  Acton Discovery Museum and classes will be especially invited.  The  students will be the facilitators of the activities around the  exhibits during these events.  The fact that these museum exhibits  were developed by girls and women of the surrounding communities  will be emphasized in the displays.  Successful completion of this  project may provide a model for collaboration among schools,  universities, and museums nationwide in enhancing learning  experiences of girls and young women.",
