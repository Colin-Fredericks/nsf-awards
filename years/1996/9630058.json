 "awd_abstract_narration": "Commercial microprocessor systems are being operated at higher and higher clock  rates. Faster clocks impact the time that is available to fetch data from cache  memory, and increases the probability of transient error occurrence in cache  memory systems. Besides data reading error, an error may also occur in the  processor subsystem, and it may write erroneous data into the cache memory.  Error-correcting codes allow detection and recovery from some of these errors  within the code word limits. Fast error detection allows damage containment and  reduces the recovery time, which otherwise could be very expensive in time. The  goals of this project are: (1) to study the extent of error propagation due to  transient faults in computer system when a fault originates either in a processor  register or a cache location; and (2) to develop techniques and hardware support  needed for early detection and recovery from such errors in computation tasks  with low overhead and low performance loss. The proposed techniques will cover  a broad spectrum from only detection to full error recovery. This research will  identify architectural features which, when provided in commercial  microprocessors, will make them suitable for use in fault-tolerant applications.  The intent is to keep the performance impact in the normal operation to a  minimal.",
