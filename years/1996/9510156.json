 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop an object-based  framework for synchronization and interprocess communication in  real-time computer systems.  This framework will integrate work  on scheduling theory with work on delay-resilient shared objects.  The term ``scheduling'' refers to the problem of sequencing tasks  on a shared execution unit such that it is possible to determine  a priori if the timing requirements of tasks are respected.  A  variety of scheduling policies will be considered in this  project, spanning the spectrum from hard to soft real-time  systems.  By focusing on delay-resilient shared objects, this  project represents a significant point of departure from past  work on real-time synchronization.  Delay-resilient objects are  distinguished by the fact that they are not locked.  The notion  of a delay-resilient shared object builds upon recent promising  work on wait-free and lock-free synchronization in shared-memory  multiprocessors.  Although such work has been ongoing for several  years, this project represents the first comprehensive effort to  integrate such objects within an object-sharing framework for  real-time computing.  From a real-time perspective, the key  advantage of delay-resilient objects is that they do not give  rise to priority inversions.  Traditional object-sharing  approaches for real-time systems rely on significant operating  system support to deal with this problem.  The proposed approach  does not require such support, and thus entails lower  synchronization overhead than traditional approaches.  Another  advantage of the proposed approach is that it can be applied  across a variety of diverse platforms.  Target platforms for this  project include uniprocessors, shared-memory and message-passing  multiprocessors, and workstation clusters.  ***",
