 "awd_abstract_narration": "9530280  Heinrichs    This research will test a new model which explains sedimentary  organic matter preservation in terms of strong adsorption to  mineral particles in sediments. In the model, preservation depends  on the concentration and solubilization rate of labile organic  matter, the adsorption coefficient of dissolved organic substances,  the sediment accumulation and bioturbation rates, and the  decomposition rates of adsorbed and dissolved organic matter. The  model not only explains global patterns of organic matter  preservation, but also the general lack of preservation of  terrigenous organic matter and kerogen in the marine environment.   The test of the model will involve: (1) measurement of adsorption  and desorption of proteins, polyamino acids, and melanoidins by  clay minerals and iron oxide, (2) studies of the decomposition of  these adsorbed substances in coastal sediments, and (3)  measurements of the adsorption of natural sediment hydrolyzable  amino acids and organic matter.    If supported by results of this research, the proposed model would  explain the large differences in organic matter preservation in  different sedimentary environments, a key process in the long-term  global carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous cycles. This would aid  interpretation of the sedimentary record of organic matter  accumulation in both recent and ancient sediments.  The model could  improve predictions of the effects of changes in ocean productivity  and sedimentation, due to human activities or natural phenomena, on  sedimentary carbon accumulation in continental margins.",
