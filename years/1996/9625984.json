 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mueller    In this research, statistical models which contain parametric, smooth and  discontinuous components are developed and applied to problems which  involve high-dimensional regression, samples of curves as observations, or  change-points and jump discontinuities. These models are motivated by  scientific problems including the longitudinal analysis of samples of  cohorts of subjects, the analysis of spatial incidence data describing the  spread of diseases, and the growth of children, where discontinuities may  occur. This also includes models which incorporate the influence of  covariates on a sample of response curves, and the construction of models  with discontinuous elements in the context of segmentation of DNA  sequences and of edge detection in image analysis. Methods for fitting the  models are devised, which typically involve complex iterative algorithms  using smoothing techniques, generalized linear models and estimating  equations as building blocks. The properties of these methods are analyzed  and they are applied to data pertaining to the scientific problems.     This research contributes to the solution of major scientific problems by  providing innovative statistical methods. One such problem is the  mortality of the older segments of a population and what one can say about  the aging process based on animal models, with potential impact on social  security and health care in the 21st century. Sophisticated methods are  needed in order to extract and combine the information on the observed  survival of the individuals from many cohorts. Another problem is to  describe and analyze the spatial spread of AIDS and of other epidemics as  time passes. A third problem is the segmentation of DNA sequences which  then may allow for association of the segments with biological functions. These  and related problems can be put into the framework of the new statistical  models which are developed in this research. The application of these  models allows to gain important new insight s into fundamental scientific  aspects of these complex problems.",
