 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anthropologists have long been interested in the relationship between biology and culture.  The  Hindu caste system, which established preferred mating practices among the populations of  India, is a good example of the impact of social processes on human biology.  Numerous  investigators have studied the effect of the caste system on genetic variation.  Yet the  generalizations from this body of work remain unconvincing for several reasons.  First, many of  the polymorphisms assayed are indirect measurements of DNA variation, are sampled from  only a few loci, and are not selectively neutral.  Second, many studies do not estimate  significance levels or confidence intervals, leaving the findings suspect.  Finally, no systematic  comparisons have been made with continental populations (i.e., Africans, Asians, and  Europeans) using a large, uniform set of DNA polymorphisms.  To date, no one has taken  advantage of the recent advances in molecular biology to address unresolved questions of  long-standing importance to human evolution in India.  The proposed research will critically  investigate the genetic evolution of South Indian caste populations by (1) formulating and testing  hypotheses of the effect of caste subdivision on genetic variation; (2) using a variety of  mitochondrial and nuclear DNA polymorphisms;  and (3) making direct comparisons to  continental populations.  The study will analyze mitochondrial DNA, Y-chromosomal DNA, and autosomal DNA  polymorphisms with differing rates of mutation from a sample representing individuals in 4  castes spanning the caste hierarchy and 2 tribal populations.  Comparisons will be made to our  existing data from caste and continental populations.",
