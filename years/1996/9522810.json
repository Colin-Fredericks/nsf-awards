 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of the project is to enhance and port a  software simulation package, SIMARC, to a Sun workstation  network.  The purpose of the SIMARC package is to enable the user  to quickly develop Modularly Configured Attached Processor (MCAP)  architectures and simulate the execution of various algorithms on  these architectures.  The SIMARC package has already  been  developed at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP)  for IBM PC compatible computers. The simulator and assembler  portions of SIMARC would be ported by a group at UTEP and the  architecture editor portion would be ported by a group at the  Instituto Technologio de Estudios Superiores Monterrey Campus  Ciudad de Mexico.  Also both groups would use the package to  develop high-performance architectures for executing signal  processing and communications algorithms.  The principal result  of the project would be a software package that could be used for  the fast prototyping of customized attached processors designed  to efficiently execute specified sets of algorithms.  ***",
