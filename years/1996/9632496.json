 "awd_abstract_narration": "Structural systems consisting of reinforced concrete  walls/cores and concrete gravity frames are a very common  structural system for moderate rise construction in regions  of high seismic risk. Use of reinforced concrete or  composite core walls and a steel gravity or moment frame  offers an economical alternative to RC wall/core and  concrete frame systems. Limited studies have been conducted  to examine bearing force transfer mechanism between steel  and concrete. However, fundamental issues related to cyclic  performance of composite walls/cores (those with steel  boundary columns) and frame-core connections are yet to be  addressed. An integrated experimental and analytical program  will be carried out to investigate the performance of  systems with walls/cores (conventionally reinforced or with  steel boundary elements) and steel gravity or moment frames.  The primary objectives of this project are to: (1) conduct  experimental studies of steel beam/floor system-to-core  connections, (2) develop analytical modeling techniques for  such connections, (3) incorporate these models into widely  used inelastic structural analysis computer programs, (4)  provide tools to investigate analytically complete building  systems to assess the economics of using hybrid/composite  systems, and (5) develop design guidelines. The research  will revolve around a prototype structure which will be used  to derive the test specimens, and to relate experimental  data to overall structural response. The proposed research  involves experimental testing of seven 1/3 -scale wall-to  steel boundary columns (which may be a small erection column  or a larger one), (2) amount of transverse reinforcement  around the connection region, (3) contribution of composite  metal decks to the stiffness and strength of the  connections, particularly `shear-only` connections, and (4)  the influence of beam axial load (tension or compression due  to composite metal deck diaphragm action) on the performance  of shear and moment connections. General analytical studies  of specimen behavior will be conducted to evaluate the  ability of simplified code equations to predict the strength  of the subassemblages. Detailed analytical studies will also  be conducted by using simplified mechanical models  constructed based on equilibrium and compatibility  requirements, and finite element models. These studies will  assist in understanding observed specimen behavior, as well  as to study additional specimen configurations not  considered in the experimental phase of the research.  Specific recommendations for connection design will be  developed.",
