Fluids which microscopically consist of particles, Brownian  motion, etc.       Remarkably, often the physics of the coarser scale is  expressed through simple autonomous laws, and symmetries not  found in the finer description.  The proposed research will  analyze mathematically the emergence of such \"scaling  limits\",  in the context of a number of models of  statistical mechanics, and field theory.  Particular  attention will be devoted to the mathematical analysis of  the large scale features seen in critical systems.       Another topic of study will concern the effects of  quenched disorder, which quite often modifies the  characteristics of vibration modes, electrical conduction  properties, and the nature of phase transitions.       The study aims at reaching both physical understanding  and mathematically satisfactory means of analyzing  significant phenomenon these fields.  ***",
