University of Colorado  Title: The Dynamics of Low-Frequency Phenomena    The PI will investigate and describe:  o    The morphology of the monsoon and its relationship with other       circulation systems.  This project represents a major new       initiative in the study of low frequency phenomena.  o    Wave propagation through the very complex background flow of       tropics.  The PI plans to extend earlier work and to       investigate the impact of vertical shear on equatorial wave       propagation and, finally consider all shears and stretching       deformations concurrently.  o    Intraseasonal variability from the perspective of coupled       ocean-atmosphere dynamic systems.  The PI notes that the       location of convection in the tropics and its organization on       the intraseasonal time scales remains largely unexplained.  He       plans to investigate this organization from a fundamental       perspective relative to the coupled ocean-atmosphere system.  The monsoons and the circulation associated with the east-west sea-  surface temperature (SST) gradients produce a slowly evolving  system within which resides a large proportion of the interannual  variability of the climate system.  The slow migrations of  convection clusters which make up the intraseasonal variability in  the tropics may be products of the low frequency monsoon-ENSO  system.  To a first approximation, the regions where equatorial  transient waves accumulate their energy or where they influence  higher latitudes is determined by the slowly evolving state of the  monsoon-ENSO system.  The PI proposes a program in which the low  frequency monsoon-ENSO systems is defined within the context of  ocean-atmosphere-land coupling.    This research is important because it seeks knowledge about the  factors that control the seasonal-to-interannual variability of the  climate.  Such knowledge is required in order to improve the  prediction of climate variability on these time s cales.",
