 "awd_abstract_narration": "9624048  Campuzano    Angle-Resolved   Photoemission will be used to  study  many-  body   effects  in   high  temperature superconductors.  The  technique  will  provide clues on  (1)  the  nature  of  the  spectral function of the quasiparticles  in the  normal  and  superconducting  states,  (2) the momentum  distribution  of  the   normal  and superconducting states, (3) the dependence  of  the quasiparticle  lifetime on temperature, momentum and  energy,   (4)   the  relationship   between   the  van  Hove  singularity    and    the    normal    and   superconducting  properties,  (5)  the  nature of  the  superconducting   gap  function  in  the  clean limit. Limited preliminary  results  indicate   that   these     properties    exhibit    unusual  behavior,      and     that     the      high    temperature  superconductors   still  have  many   interesting    Physics  surprises in store for us.  %%%  Angle-Resolved   Photoemission will be used to  study  many-  body   effects in  high temperature superconductors. In this  technique, the sample is irradiated with ultra-violet light.  This  causes the electrons in  that sample  to  be  ejected.  By  analyzing  the  energies  of  those  ejected  electrons,  the  state  of the electrons in the sample can be  obtained.  This   information can, in conventional materials, lead   to  understand  how  the  material carries current, and  how  it  becomes   superconducting  upon   cooling.   However,   high  temperature  superconductors do not behave like conventional  materials.  The electrols in these materials  interact  with  each  other  and  the  motion of one  electron  is  strongly  correlated with the motion of other electrons. Materials  in  which   this   occurs   are  called   \"Strongly   Correlated  Materials\".  The  proposal  seeks  to  provide   a    direct  measurement  of  the \"spectral  distribution\".  The   latter  measures   the probability of adding or removing an electron  from   the sample.  This  will lead to the understa nding  of  the   novel    electronic  properties  of  high  temperature  superconductors.  ***",
