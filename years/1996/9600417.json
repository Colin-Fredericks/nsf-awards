The researchers  intend to address basic issues related to  the understanding of the reaction and excitation mechanisms  in nucleon induced inclusive reactions. The purpose of the  planned experiments is to provide high quality data on spin  transfer for subsequent theoretical interpretation and  analysis.  The objectives are to develop a theoretical  framework to interpret the data in terms of couplings  between reaction and excitation mechanisms and to study the  dependence on the nucleon-nucleon interaction.  The  experiment might eventually lead to a much more fundamental  understanding of nuclear phenomena in terms of a microscopic  theory.    The microscopic understanding of simple nuclear phenomena  relating to the structure and reaction degrees of freedom  has been greatly enhanced in the last few years both from  the experimental and theoretical approaches.  However,  there still exist important and troubling questions about  how a nucleus responds to certain classes of external  stimuli.  The proposed experiments, to take place at the  Indiana University Cyclotron Facility, should provide a  complete set of data to test more deeply the different  theoretical models.  The  group of the University of Chile  will develop new theoretical calculations  to explain the  data by working on the development of a microscopic theory  for reactions. They will then construct the codes for  calculating the corresponding observables.  The results of  this collaborative effort could be a major contribution to  the field of charge exchange in nuclear reactions.  ***",
