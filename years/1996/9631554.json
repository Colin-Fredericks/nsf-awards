 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research results over the last thirty years have indicated that  finitely presented groups are very complex in their subgroup  structure.  For instance, it is known that a finitely generated  metabelian group is a subgroup of a finitely presented metabelian  group.  In order to examine still further the complexity of  finitely presented groups, it is of interest to determine whether  a finitely generated metabelian group with a specific property  can be embedded in a finitely presented metabelian group with the  same property.  The initial objective of the investigator had  been to prove the general statement that if G is a finitely  generated residually nilpotent (or residually torsion-free  nilpotent) metabelian group, then G is a subgroup of a finitely  presented metabelian group that is also residually nilpotent (or  residually torsion-free nilpotent).  This appears to be a  complicated problem, as evidenced by the machinery required to  solve it for the free metabelian case.    In the special case of free metabelian groups it is known that  finitely generated free metabelian groups are residually  nilpotent and residually torsion-free nilpotent.  The  investigator has proved that a finitely generated free metabelian  group can be embedded in a finitely presented metabelian group  that is also residually nilpotent.  Furthermore, a finitely  generated free metabelian group can be embedded in a finitely  presented metabelian group that is also residually torsion-free  nilpotent.  One of the tools developed by the investigator to  obtain these results is a sufficient condition for the residual  nilpotence and residual torsion-free nilpotence of certain  finitely presented metabelian groups that arise from a matrix  representation for metabelian groups.  The matrix entries belong  to specified groups and specified modules of fractions.  To show  the sufficient condition can be satisfied, use is made of the  notion of S-isolator of an ideal, where S is a multiplicative  semigroup.  The investigat or is attempting to develop further  insight and additional tools with which to try to solve the  initial problem mentioned above.  An extension to be considered  is to let the matrix entries belong to certain factor groups of  modules and to determine whether the resulting matrix group is  residually torsion-free nilpotent.",
