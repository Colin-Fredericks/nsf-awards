This conference  will be the fifth in a series which began in 1987 but the  first request to NSF for funding. It is the major  international gathering for researchers who use hole burning  and related frequency and coherent time domain  spectroscopies to understand the relationships between  disorder, electronic/vibrational structure and various  dynamical processes in complex solids and those who use the  basic science to develop advanced application concepts. The  conference will address several important issues. They  include a firmer understanding of the physics associated  with practical high temperature hole burning and better  approaches to the design and fabrication of the \"ideal\" hole  burning medium, a microscopic description of the two-level  systems which dictate the properties of glasses at low  temperatures, convincing demonstration that the  spectroscopic and dynamical properties of \"single\" molecules  are consistent with those of an ensemble and further  demonstration of how line-narrowing and single-molecule  spectroscopies combined with external fields can improve our  understanding of intermolecular interactions. The conference  topics reflect the interdisciplinary and fundamental-applied  nature of the HBRS meeting.  The meeting provides a superb  learning experience for graduate students and postdoctoral  fellows. Not only do they interact with leading scientists  from around the world, they will be exposed to science from  several disciplines and are stimulated to think about the  applications of basic research.  %%%  The technological impact that is resulting from these  studies of structural disorder and electronic structure and  dynamics in glasses, polymers and proteins is large.  Advanced applications such as frequency and time domain  optical storage, and chemical sensing are examples of  sign ificant developments.  ***",
