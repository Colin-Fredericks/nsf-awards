 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9626942  Akse  This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project will result in the design, fabrication, and testing of an innovative chemiluminescence (CL) based prototype analyzer capable of continuous chlorine monitoring in water. This innovative new technology combines the intrinsic selectivity and sensitivity of CL with the reproducibility and ease of operation afforded by the use of solid phase modules for control of the pH, luminol concentration, and as a means to calibrate the analyzer. Solid phase beds eliminate the need for reagent preparation, and can be quickly and easily exchanged after long periods of operation (>30 days). Monochloramine, the most common interference in colorimetric analysis for chlorine, produces no CL response in the chlorine analyzer. Operation conditions, component hardware, solid phase bed design, and CL detection efficiency will be refined based on performance and commercial potential. Methods will be developed for quantitation of total chlorine and reagentless calibration. A prototype will be built and tested on real water samples forming the basis for commercialization of the technology.  Such an instrument will permit precise control of chlorination processes reducing the health risks caused by the formation and release of chlorinated by-products associated with over-chlorination, particularly in drinking water. Current analytical instruments are poorly suited to this task due to interferences, unstable reagents, time dependent responses, operator dependent results, poor reproducibility, and expense. The CL analyzer will meet the need for a sensitive, accurate, highly selective, and inexpensive instrument that is easy to use with a minimum of operator intervention.  ***",
