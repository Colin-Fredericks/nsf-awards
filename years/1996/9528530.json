 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Prof.   Charles S. Johnson of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill   will pursue a number of research objectives:  1) he will expand the   capabilities of Diffusion Order Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy   (DOSY), so that it can be used to study systems with very small diffusion   coefficients.  This will require very large magnetic field gradients, and   Johnson plans on exploiting the large fringe fields of the   superconducting magnet for the pulsed field gradient NMR.   2) He plans   on measuring molecular weight distributions of fluoropolymers in   supercritical carbon dioxide, an environmentally benign solvent; this   will require the design of a high pressure instrument.  3) Johnson will   develop heteronuclear DOSY, and 4) he will make improvements on   electrophoretic NMR techniques using Mobility Ordered 2-dimensional NMR   spectroscopy, or MOSY.    DOSY and electrophoretic NMR allow the measurement of molecular diffusion   coefficients as a function of the chemical shifts of the various species   present in a mixture.  This new work will extend considerably the range   of diffusion coefficients which can be measured, while also providing   better sensitivity and resolution.  Supercritical carbon dioxide is a   viable replacement for aqueous and organic solvent systems, especially   the ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons.   The research effort in   fluoropolymers in supercritical fluids should prove critical to   furthering the basic understanding of the chemistry and dynamics of these   solution systems.",
