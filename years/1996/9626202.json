 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626202  Katz       The p and h-p versions of the finite element method are now  firmly established as important methods for finite element  analysis (FEA).  A major part of the computational burden in FEA  is the solution of the assembled system of equations.  Current  practical problems, particularly those in three (or higher)  dimensions, may require the determination of hundreds of  thousands, even millions of unknowns.  Such problems cannot be  solved on serial computers because of excessive computation time  and memory requirements.  Implementation on parallel processors  is indispensable because of time requirements.  Iterative methods  are indispensable because of memory requirements.  Whereas  iterative methods for the h-version of FEA have long been the  object of much investigation (e.g. domain decomposition,  multi-grid), relatively little is known about iterative schemes  for the p-version.  This research addresses that problem.  Multi-p methods can be used independently as smoothers, or as  preconditioners for other iterations such as conjugate gradient.  The term multi-p processes includes both approaches.  This  research develops multi-p V cycle methods with particular  emphasis on problems in 3D.  Parallelization with respect to both  computation costs, costs of communication among processors, and  costs of using auxiliary memory are considered.  The use of  multi-p algorithms as preconditioners, which currently shows  great promise for 2D problems, is a major area of study.  The  ultimate objective of the research is to make the p-version of  FEA a practical tool for large scale problems.       Modern engineering design relies heavily on computer  simulations, and specifically on high-performance computing.  For  example, in structural elastic analysis, it is necessary to solve  (sometimes nonlinear) partial differential equations on  complicated geometries.  To solve such partial differential  equations numerically on computers, discretization techniques are  used.  Such discr etizations may involve thousands or hundreds of  thousands unknowns and efficient numerical methods are  indispensable.  The numerical techniques being developed in this  project lead to procedures that assure the reliability of  engineering decisions based on high-performance computing.  The  algorithms being formulated permits solution of (nonlinear)  mathematical models in diverse areas including those used in  aircraft and automobile structural design, determining elastic  properties of the human heart, study of boundary layer effects in  composite materials, and fatigue life analysis.",
