 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop new methods for numerically modelling  incompressible fluid flows of the type that appear in global  environmental modelling problems.  The proposed models are  hyperbolic and dispersive vertically-averaged models of  stratified incompressible flow which are derived from the  Navier-Stokes equations.  These models reduce three-dimensional  models to a system of complex two-dimensional models, which  promise greater numerical efficiency.  However, the averaged  models are not well posed for some interesting ranges of their  parameters.  Consequently, their instability and regularization  must be investigated.  This analysis, along with the  discretization of the continuum equations, the accuracy and  stability analysis of the discrete problems, and the coding of  the discrete equations are all algebraically complex, so the use  of computer algebra will play a critical role in this project.    The results of the project can be used for the global modelling  of the ocean, the atmosphere, and other complex environments.  The current codes implementing detailed models of such  environments require computational resources that tax even the  largest computers.  The goal of this project is to produce new  models and numerical methods for their solution which would  represent a significant improvement in efficiency and accuracy  over existing models for some important applications.  ***",
