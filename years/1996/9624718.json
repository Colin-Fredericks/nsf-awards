 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of the research effort is the use of enone-initiated,   nickel-catalyzed carbocyclization reactions to afford highly   functionalized, complex products from simple, readily available   substrates.  The methodology will be applied to the synthesis of the   cis-fused (3.2.0) bicyclooctane framework of caracyclin, the tricyclic   ring skeleton of pentalenic acid and the exocyclic, trisubstituted   alkenes of geissoschizine and Z-isositsirikine.  The educational plan   includes outreach efforts to Detroit schools, the introduction of   molecular modeling and on-line searching to undergraduate courses, course   development at the graduate level and collaborative graduate training   with top scientists at Parke-Davis.  With this CAREER award, the   Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research and educational   activities of Dr. John Montgomery of the Department of Chemistry at Wayne   State University.  Professor Montgomery will focus his research efforts   on drawing together nickel- promoted conjugate additions with   meta-mediated cyclizations as the basis for a new cyclization protocol   that will result in the construction of the complex ring systems that   occur in natural products.  The educational plan includes innovative   teaching approaches in chemistry at the high school, undergraduate and   graduate levels.",
