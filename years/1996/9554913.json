 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal aims to design an integrated two semester  general education course in mathematics and science. The  work will involve two more-or-less separate activities:  1)  The revision of a first draft of the mathematical material,  relying on results of pilot testing with undergraduates at  William and Mary and Norfolk State University and with in-  service teachers at ten university sites across the state of  Virginia.  2) The construction and piloting of a  physics/engineering portion of the material which will  directly reference the mathematics encountered by students  in the first term.  The central theme of the mathematical  material is that real engineering data will be used by  students who will be asked to solve problems that directly  bear on an intuitive grasp of a particular physical setting:  Powered aircraft flight. This data is freely available from  multiple sources: daily wind data, wind histories,  navigation maps and runway plates, weights and dimensions of  commercial aircraft and current magnetic declination data.  Computations involve arithmetic, elementary algebra, some  geometry, some trigonometry, and some use of hand-  calculators for numerical integration. Problems are selected  because they are elementary. Omitted because of mathematical  complexity are many problems that would be part of a  standard introduction to aeronautical engineering.  The  engineering/science part of this work will ask students to  obtain some of these data themselves, with a view to getting  information that is crucial to the proper function of  aircraft. We will also design appropriate experiments to  test physical laws that are important to flight. Our entire  aim is to convince non-science students that they can  enhance their grasp of the outside world by means of  elementary calculations and data acquisition.",
