A manifold is a second countable Hausdorff topological space which is  locally homeomorphic to euclidean space.  There is quite a difference  in studying manifolds in high dimensions and in low dimensions, and  this project is mainly concerned with high dimensional phenomena.  The  non-linear similarity problem is the question whether two  representations of finite groups can be homeomorphic without being  linearly ismorphic.  This question is high-dimensional in nature,  since it is easy to see that such phenomena cannot occur in dimensions  lower than four.  The other main part of this project is the Novikov  and Borel conjectures.  These conjectures are concerned with  classification of manifolds in high dimensions.  Classification is, of  course, interesting in all dimensions, but the methods are quite  different in high dimensions and in low dimensions.       The project has connections to many branches of mathematics, notably  to analysis.  The main methods used are from controlled topology, and  there are analogues of controlled topological problems in analysis,  notably through the Baum-Connes conjectures.  While high dimensional   manifolds are not readily accessible to our mind's eye, they arise  naturally in real-life situations whenever there are numerous degrees of  freedom, as, for example, the space of all possible configurations of a  mechanical linkage with numerous joints and pivots.  ***",
