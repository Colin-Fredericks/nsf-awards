 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bramble  9626567       The main objectives of this project are the construction and  study of finite element approximations to steady-state and  transient problems of mechanics and engineering, including  convection-diffusion-reaction problems, Stokes and Navier-Stokes  equations, equations of linear elasticity, plate bending  problems, and the construction, analysis, and testing of fast  methods for solving the resulting algebraic systems.  The emphasis  is on the development of new accurate, robust and efficient  computational techniques.  Approximation strategies involving  standard Galerkin finite element methods, novel least-squares  methods, and mixed finite element methods are studied especially  from the standpoint of their accuracy and stability.  The solution  techniques that are developed emphasize preconditioning via  domain decomposition or multigrid/multilevel methods.       The broad objective of this program is to use the full power  of rigorous mathematics both to analyze the behavior of numerical  methods currently used in scientific computation and to develop  new algorithms exhibiting improved accuracy, stability and  performance.  More efficient and scalable algorithms can have a  significant impact on the development of effective simulators for  understanding physical processes of national importance.  For  example, computer modeling of ground water processes involve the  solution of large complex systems of nonlinear partial  differential equations.  The results of these simulations provide  important predictive information that can influence decisions  with regard to ground water remediation strategies and national  conservation programs.  Due to the complexity in the geometry and  the physical processes, meaningful simulations overwhelm today's  most powerful parallel computers and hence the need for more  effective numerical techniques.  The techniques developed are  applicable as well to problems such as simulation of smart  materials, heat and mass transfer, and high  performance  computing.",
