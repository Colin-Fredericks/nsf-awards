 "awd_abstract_narration": "9634823  Thorp    The study of North American Reliability Council reports over a  five year period indicates that protection systems frequently  play a role in the sequence of events that lead to power system  disturbances.  It is likely that reliability will be treated as a  commodity in the deregulated systems of the future.  For example  the failure of the Independent Systems Operator (ISO) to  facilitate a negotiated sale of power between a producer and a  load because of a false trip of a key transmission line could  result in the payment of a penalty or otherwise effect the price  of transmission services.  In spite of its importance, the impact  of protection system malfunctions on overall system reliability  has not been well studied.  The existing protection system with  its multiple zones of protection and redundant systems is biased  toward dependability, that is a fault is always cleared by some  relay.  Present day relaying systems are designed to be  dependable at the cost of security. While it is generally  believed that the self-monitoring and self-checking feature of  digital relays will reduce the probability of undetected or  \"hidden failures\" in relays, the number of installed  microprocessor relays is still small.  Further, there has been no  qualitative evaluation of the effect on system reliability of the  installation of large number of digital relays.         The proposed research is to develop techniques to evaluate   the impact on system reliability of the protection system and to  appraise the value of the installation of new digital relays with  built in self-monitoring and self-checking or other modifications  of the protection system.  It seems possible that the new  paradigm for power system operation will provide the impetus for  a more modern protection system. That is, the economics of  transmission system reliability will require that the relaying  system be modernized.  The two key elements of the proposed  approach are the use of \"importance sampling\" and th e generation  of large data bases of power system operating conditions such as  those used for training of various artificial schemes and  evaluation of the performance of new control schemes.  The  \"importance sampling\" technique is a simulation technique to  study \"rare\" events such as major power system disturbances. The  generation of data bases of power system operating conditions for  training of various artificial intelligence schemes has become a  subject of recent study.  They have been used for preventive  control for transient stability, for prediction of instability  from real-time phasor measurements, or the control of DC lines  using real-time phasor measurements.  The essence of the proposed  research is to combine the two techniques i.e., to create a  database biased toward the unlikely events as the probabilities  are based in importance sampling.  Data base generation has been  recognized as a statistical approach where the data base could be  generated by randomly sampling the parameters that describe  system operation.  The work proposed here would use the data base  as a surrogate for the underlying probability space.  The data base  would be biased toward the unlikely events just as the  probabilities are altered in importance sampling so that the impact  of reducing \"hidden failures\" can be studied through simulation.    The specific tasks involved in the proposed research are:       *    Investigation of probability models for the dependence            of hidden failures on system conditions..       *    Modifications of importance sampling to make it more            appropriate for power system applications       *    Examination of performance indices appropriate to the            importance sampling approach       *    Generation of data bases using the Cornell Production            Super Computer  ***",
