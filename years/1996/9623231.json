 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623231  PELLER    V.V. Peller is going to continue to study superoptimal approximation by  analytic operator functions. Such approximations minimize not only the  supremum of the norms but also the suprema of all further singular values.  In particular V.V. Peller is going to study the dependence of the Mcmillan  degree of the superoptimal approximant on the Mcmillam degree of the initial   function. It is not known whether the Mcmillan degree can jump. Another  open problem is whether the operator of superoptimal approximation preserves  the Wiener algebra. V.V. Peller is also going to study the indices in  the so-called thematic factorizations in the Nehari-Takagi problem and  other problem on superoptimal approximation. V.V. Peller is also going to  continue his work in prediction theory. One of the most important  unsolved problems is to characterize in terms of the spectral densities  the completely regular vectorial stationary Gaussian processes.    V.V. Peller is going to apply Hankel operators in different domains of  analysis, prediction theory and control theory. It has become clear that  Hankel operators play a significant role in applications. In particular   they play a decisive role in H-infinity control theory. V.V. Peller  used Hankel operators to study superoptimal approximations by analytic  matrix functions. In his joint work with N.J. Young it was shown that under  very natural assumptions such an approximation is unique and can be found  constructively. Further development of the theory was given by V.V. Peller  and in joint papers of V.V. Peller with S.R. Treil. Superoptimal approximations  play a very important role in control theory.  There are still many open problems about superoptimal approximations  which are very important in applications. V.V. Peller is going to continue   to work on them. Another domain of applications of Hankel operators is   prediction theory.  V.V. Peller obtained many strong results (partly in a   joint work with Khrushchev) in this field. The re are still many open problems  in this field. V.V. Peller hopes to progress using vectorial Hankel  operators.",
