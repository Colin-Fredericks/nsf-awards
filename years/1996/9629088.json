 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Alan Cowley, Department of Chemistry, University of Texas at Austin,   is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program   of the Chemistry Division for studies of main group rings, clusters, and   assemblies. Several new unsaturated ring systems featuring the group 13   elements will be prepared, some with potential as candidates for ring   opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP).  Heteronorbornadienes will be   investigated for their potential as thermal or photochemical sources of,   for example, intermetallic materials.  Assembly of bicyclic ring systems   that incorporate group 13 - group 13 bonds  into stacked architectures   will be investigated for their potentially interesting electrical and/or   magnetic properties.  Various approaches to anion recognition, including   multidentate Lewis acid assemblies that incorporate group 13 or 14   elements, will also be pursued, and new approaches to the formation of   cluster and cage-type compounds of the heavier group 13 elements will be   developed.  New combinations of main group elements (boron, aluminum, gallium, and   indium) with carbon ring systems and with one another, will be prepared   and investigated.  Apart from the intrinsic interest in the structures   and bonding descriptions of these rings, these compounds have potential   as precursors to new polymeric and intermetallic materials with novel   electrical and/or magnetic properties.  The larger ring systems are   appropriate for the selective and reversible binding of anions, and thus   have potential applications in anion transport and homogeneous catalysis",
