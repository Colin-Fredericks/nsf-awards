 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coming Broadband Integrated Services Digital Networks (B-ISDNs) will be  required to carry a broad range of traffic classes ranging from bursty,  variable-rate sources, such as voice and variable-rate coded video, to  smooth constant bit rate sources.  Moreover, these networks will have to do  so while providing a guaranteed quality-of-service (QoS) to these traffic  classes.  The problem of characterizing the performance of such networks is  thus particularly important since this must be done, not only during the  network design (in an off-line manner) but also for on-line control  purposes such as call admission control.  In this proposal we describe a  novel technique for evaluating network performance based on the use of  Global Rational Approximations (GRA) which has the potential of providing  accurate estimates for a variety of performance measures such as packet  loss probability in a wide variety of network settings.  We outline  research on GRAs whose aim is to develop a solid theoretical foundation on  which the proposed algorithms can rest and to develop practical techniques  for estimating network performance both during the design phase and in a  real-time setting.  Specifically, we propose to develop a complete  theoretical foundation on which to develop algorithms for obtaining  accurate global rational approximations for a variety of quality-of-service  (QoS) metrics such as packet loss probability and probability that packet  delay exceeds a particular value and to develop practical algorithms which  can be used to evaluate large B ISDNs.",
