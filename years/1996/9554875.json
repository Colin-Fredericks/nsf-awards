 "awd_abstract_narration": "While major changes have taken place in all areas of the natural sciences, introductory instruction in both the lecture  hall and the laboratory has not changed significantly in many years.  The PI instituted innovative teaching techniques  in an elementary chemistry course called \"Chemistry and Crime:  From Sherlock Holmes to Modern Forensic  Science\" for the non-science major.  The techniques used in the laboratory have received national attention and  many colleagues have instituted similar innovations.  However, many institutions do not have the resources to  develop laboratory programs along these lines and, as times have changed, are increasingly concerned with exposing  the students to situations now recognized as potentially dangerous.    Since the PI has proven that forensics can be used to spark interest in science and since it is given that young people  are intrigued by computer graphics, it was decided to use computer animated simulations to allow extensive,  intensive investigation of scientific evidence collected at simulated crime scenes and studied using simulated  scientific instruments.  These animated modules will enhance not only the laboratory program in the forensic science  course but also the programs in introductory science courses for majors.    The PI will guide the development of the computer animated modules, develop the story board and oversee the  computer interfacing and the integration of the components into the curriculum.  The actual modules will be created  by Engineering Animation, Inc.  EAI, using their Vislab software, is one of the premier computer animation  companies in the world.    It is anticipated that implementing this innovative and creative approach, as part of an overall multimedia program  including actual laboratory experience, will enhance science education by stimulating interest and engendering  enthusiasm instead of promoting the stereotype that science is boring and hard.",
