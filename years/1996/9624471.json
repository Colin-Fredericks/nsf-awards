The research component will focus on  the   development and application of dynamical systems theory to  physical   problems in bubble dynamics and accelerators, as well as the  study of split-  operator numerical schemes.  In the area of bubble dynamics, the  research   will focus on the strongly nonlinear differential equations  modeling one-   and two-bubble systems.  In particular, a Hamiltonian formulation  of two-  bubble systems is proposed that reveals the salient features of  their   interaction and facilitates a quantitative global analysis of  these systems.    An improved criterion for the cavitation of isolated bubbles is  also sought.    In the area of accelerators, the work comprises a broad array of  analytical   and numerical questions that involve the rates of nonlinear  growth of shear   layers, the magnitudes of their saturation amplitudes, the  development of   Melnikov theory for integro-differential equations, and the  dynamics of   amplitude-modulated beams in a Radio Frequency Quadrapole.  The  work   on split-operator schemes will involve identifying the explicit  structure of   Nth order partitioned split-operator schemes.  The education plan  aims to   incorporate into the classroom several aspects of the principal  investigator's   experience in applied dynamical systems theory.  On the graduate  level, a   multi-tiered effort is underway through which current graduate  students in   mathematics are trained to conduct applied dynamical systems  research, and   students from other disciplines (mechanical engineering,  cognitive and   neural science, and economics) acquire tools from dynamical  systems for   their research.  The effort also includes the development of a  new course in   nonlinear dynamics of bubble oscillations, research group  activity in   singular perturbation theory, and a complete revision of an   advanced   undergraduate course in  the methods of applied mathematics.    The National Science Foundation strongly encourages the early   development of academic faculty as both educators and  researchers.  The   Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a  Foundation-  wide  program that provides for the support of junior faculty  within the   context of their overall career development.  It combines in a  single   program the support of quality research and education in the  broadest sense   and the full participation of those traditionally  underrepresented in science   and engineering.  This program enhances and emphasizes the  importance   the Foundation places on the development of full, balanced  academic   careers which include both research and education.",
