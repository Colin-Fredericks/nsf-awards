 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the proposed study is to test a theory of the influence of community, neighborhood, and family functioning on the social development of African-American and Latino male adolescents living in inner-city and other urban poor communities.  Research in child and adolescent development has long recognized the family as the most proximal and perhaps primary influence on child behavioral and emotional development.  However, there is increasing recognition that families' ability to provide necessary functions for social development such as modeling of behavior, consistent care, and emotional support is constrained or enabled by characteristics of the neighborhood and community in which they live.  Parental styles and beliefs do not merely reflect individual proclivities, but also are shaped by considerations outside the family, especially the social organization of the community.  This study uses existing data from a four-year longitudinal study that has tracked multi-level indicators of adjustment and promising predictors for 300 inner-city male youth and their families to test the impact of community structure (e.g., mobility, poverty, heterogeneity) on neighborhood social organization (e.g., support, involvement, resource use) and family functioning and relate these influences to adequacy of social development as indicated by involvement in criminal behavior, educational attainment and employment of inner-city youth. The nature of the transaction between communities and families over time and variations in relations across ethnic groups are also examined.  The hypotheses and related models to be tested can direct risk identification efforts (e.g., focus on community vs. neighborhood vs. specific families), prevention programs (identify which aspects of social context are necessary and sufficient program targets), and policy (the likely benefit and limitation investments in community economic and social resources to decrease youth risk).  %%%  The purpose of the proposed study is to test a theory of the influence of community, neighborhood, and family functioning on the social development of African-American and Latino male adolescents living in inner-city and other urban poor communities.  Research in child and adolescent development has long recognized the family as perhaps the most important influence on child development.  However, there is increasing recognition that families' ability to provide necessary functions for social development is strongly influenced by the neighborhood and community in which they live.  Parental styles and beliefs do not merely reflect individual proclivities, but also are shaped by considerations outside the family, especially the social organization of the community.  This study uses existing data from a four-year longitudinal study that has tracked 300 inner-city male youth and their families to test the impact of community structure (e.g., mobility and poverty) on neighborhood social organization (e.g., support, involvement, resource use) and family functioning.  The study examines such outcomes as criminal behavior, educational attainment and employment.  The model developed in this research holds promise in helping to identify problems for which inner-city youth are at particular risk, to develop prevention programs, and to inform policy on community economic and social resources.",
