 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the use of an atomic force microscope to strengthen and extend an already vigorous program of undergraduate participation in physics research. The microscope does not function as an isolated technological curiosity; instead, it is an essential component of the ongoing physics laboratory research program, and is intellectually and operationally accessible to undergraduates. The research program addresses topics of current interest in condensed matter physics while exposing students to a broad spectrum of modern experimental techniques critical to basic research as well as to fields of direct economic importance such as electrical engineering, nanofabrication, and materials science. These techniques include cryogenics, high vacuum, thin-film deposition, photolithography, electronic design and construction, machine shop practice, and electrical measurements. The new apparatus introduces fresh research opportunities for undergraduates and enhances the quality and significance of their work. The program may also be a useful and appealing model for other physicists interested in pursuing publishable research with undergraduate assistance.",
