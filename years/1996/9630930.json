The solubility of  4He in 3He is very low at ultra-  low   temperatures   but  recent  theoretical  predictions   have  suggested  a finite value at zero temperature.  If so,  a  weakly  interacting  dilute  Bose gas (the dissolved 4He  quasiparticles)  would  coexist in a solution of Fermion superfluid and provide  a  unique   opportunity   to  study  interacting   superfluids.    A  stringent  test  of  Fermi liquid theory  will  result  from  the  determination  of  the  solubility.   The  free  energy  of   the  interface  between  the two coexisting phases in  phase-separated  liquid  mixtures will be measured as a function of  pressure  and  temperature.    The  results  will  indicate   whether   3He   is  preferentially  adsorbed  near  the  interface  and  compared  to  fundamental  many-body quantum theories. A   measurement  of  the  coalescence of two helium atom beams is planned to determine  the  nature of the scattering cross-section at very low velocities and  investigate the dimerization of helium atoms.  %%%  A  fundamental  theory of matter, Fermi liquid  theory,  used  to  understand systems as disparate as neutron stars, nuclear matter,  and  electrons in ordinary and superconducting metals, is  to  be  tested in a new way by studying 4He atoms dissolved in liquid 3He  at  extremely low temperatures. The experiment is to measure,  at  temperatures less than 0.1 degrees above absolute zero, the  rate  at  which  the 4He atoms diffuse through the liquid 3He  and  the  maximum  amount  that  may  be  dissolved  as  functions  of  the  temperature and pressure. The theory predicts a relation  between  these  effects. In a second low temperature experiment, two beams  of  colliding  4He atoms will be used to measure  the  very  weak  chemical bond between a pair of 4He atoms.  ***",
