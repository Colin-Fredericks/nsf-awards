 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will use atomic absorption spectroscopy to enhance the chemistry curriculum, via relevant issues in chemistry, environmental science, and other areas. Both science and non-science majors will be introduced to the use of the instrument. The instrument will be used for hands-on student laboratory exercises in the introductory, general, and analytical chemistry courses.               The project will make some use of standard protocols for student exercises, but will also be committed to developing lab exercises for lower-division undergraduate courses. Anticipated exercises include water analysis, environmental analysis, food and forensic analyses, and data handling exercises. For introductory chemistry, as a followup to electronic spectra, application of AA will be brought into a laboratory exercise, for example by analyzing water samples for sodium or paint samples for lead. In general chemistry, AA is to be used in a more rigorous way, including at least one AA exercise each semester. The first semester will compare metal analysis results from AA and home water test kits, or a comparable exercise. In the second semester, the AA will be used for environmental applications, by incorporating a mini-site assessment in the laboratory. Exercises in field sampling and sample preparation will be incorporated. In quantitative analysis, the AA instrument will be used to educate students in the rigorous standards routinely required to meet regulatory agency standards for metals analysis in water, soil and other analytes, using both flame and graphite furnace methods in suitable \"real-world\" analysis situations. The instrument will also be used for student independent study projects, to examine aspects of local water quality and soil pollution. The project intends also to develop short exercises that can be used by the administration of justice and biotechnology programs at Contra Costa College.",
