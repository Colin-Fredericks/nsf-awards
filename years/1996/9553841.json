 "awd_abstract_narration": "9553841  Greenberg    Image processing has been shown to be a powerful medium for engaging diverse learners, whose needs have not been met in the past, in the study of science and mathematics.  The technique is an effective and engaging way to study the applications of science and mathematics to real-world situations as represented by digital imagery.  It brings science research to the classroom; science is learned as science is done.  Students and teachers are lead into exploration, inquiry and analysis using real data sets and state-of-the-art computer tools. These supplemental materials, useful in middle and high schools are based on successful materials developed in teacher enhancement programs and provide a context for changing traditional classroom structure to a learning community.  Teachers are supported by on-line services and a network of professional development opportunities.  Subject specific CDROMs are produced in physics, biology and Earth science.  The standards-based activities are designed to meet specific learning goals and lead to creative student-generated products for performance-based assessment of student achievement.  Students also learn about mathematical concepts that underlie image processing such as coordinate systems, slope and intercept, measurement and statistics.",
