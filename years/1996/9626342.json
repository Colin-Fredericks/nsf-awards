This conference  will address environmental issues relating to the management of  water under varied geophysical settings but concentrating on  locations where water is scarce.  The conference is being  conducted under auspices of the American Institute of Hydrology  in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey and the Institute  of Water Problems of the Uzbekistan Academy of Sciences.  Membership an the U.S. organizing Committee includes  representation from the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S.  Department of Agriculture.  Conference topics include hydrology  of arid regions, innovative water resource management concepts  and associated technologies.    This conference is organized to address problems of water  resource management especially those experienced by water  resource managers in geophysical locations characterized as being  arid or semi-arid.  Results of the conference are expected to  include identification of significant research needs water  quality protection, pollution prevention of both surface and  groundwater and the impacts of agricultural practices on water  quality.  ***",
