 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some biochemicals in the brain apparently affect behavior;  for example, a high level of the amine compound serotonin  has been linked to aggression in a wide range of both  vertebrate and invertebrate species.  It is very difficult  in the complex brain of vertebrate animals to study the way  in which particular chemicals affect the function of  particular single nerve cells, or neurons.  In contrast,  some invertebrate animals have limited numbers of large  identifiable neurons, allowing analysis of complex  behavioral processes at the level of the precise cells  thought to be involved.  This collaborative work in three  different laboratories exploits the well-studied behavior of  crayfish and the very accessible nervous system of these  animals, as a model system.  A variety of behavioral,  pharmacological, molecular and physiological approaches are  used to determine how amine compounds modulate the  aggressive activity of dominant and non-dominant animals in  their social hierarchies, and how particular amine-  containing nerve cells are important in these behaviors.     Results from this work will be fundamental to  understanding how compounds that are used by certain cells  as neural transmitters also can have effects on modulating  behavior.  By clarifying the roles of amines in complex  behavioral processes, such as aggression in the nervous  systems of animals far more complex than this model system,  the results will have an impact beyond cellular neuroscience  and neuroethology to other areas of behavior neuroscience  and psychology.",
