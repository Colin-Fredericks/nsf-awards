 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in both hardware and software design have enabled system designers to  develop large, complex embedded systems. Such systems may contain a mixture of  software programs running on general purpose or special-purpose processors,  high-speed memory systems, and application specific hardware devices. One of the  key tasks in designing these systems is to find a \"best\" system architecture  including determining the \"right\" partition between hardware and software  components and selecting the \"right\" hardware components. The focus of this  project is to develop a viable methodology as well as a set of tools to assist  system designers in this architectural design exploration task.  The research  proposed performs design exploration at the system level. At this level, a system  is specified as a collection of task graphs and an implementation is described  by an interconnection of hardware components and an assignment of processes to  the hardware components. Though the problem shares some similarities with the  hardware synthesis problem, many different issues need to be addressed in order  for this approach to be effective.  One of the issues is identifying and  estimating appropriate parameters to be included in the exploration process such  that system timing performance can be adequately predicted. The project  emphasizes design exploration for embedded systems with real-time constraints.  Such systems can be found in many applications, such as navigation and landing  control of aircraft, networks and communications. Attributes that are useful for  guiding design exploration will be devised so as to efficiently analyze the  timing behavior of a large number of implementations with respect to the system  timing specifications and hence permit exploration of a wide range of design  options. Other issues including sensitivity analysis and component reuse will  also be addressed. To properly handle conflicting performance requirements  including both functional and non-functional attributes,  an approach based on  imprecise value functions from utility theory will be pursued. Furthermore, the  design exploration problem is formulated as a multi-attribute optimization  problem. Techniques from the evolutionary computation field will be investigated  in order to tackle the exponential nature of the optimization problem.",
