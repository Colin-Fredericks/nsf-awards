The  approach is to incorporate inorganic extended lattice  structures into organic monolayer assemblies thereby  introducing into the films structural features and  cooperative phenomena which are inherent to many inorganic  lattices, while at the same time maintaining the monolayer  control afforded by the organic assembly.  Layered solid-  state structures will be used because they offer the highest  probability of success as the inorganic lattice energy  clearly favors forming layers. Specifically, the proposed  research consists of three efforts: 1) To expand on the  protocol developed for preparing new LB materials containing  extended-lattice inorganic networks. 2) To chemically and  structurally characterize new materials and account for  structural differences. 3) To investigate the magnetic  properties of paramagnetic materials.  %%%  Several classes of mixed organic/inorganic assemblies have  received attention recently as researchers have realized  that through the combination of organic and inorganic  networks a vast array of new solid-state structures is  possible often with tunable bulk and interfacial properties.  Examples include pillared clays, organic/inorganic layered  solids, zeolites with organic guests, self-assembled organic  films at inorganic surfaces, and inorganic mesostructures  formed with the aid of organic surfactants. In addition to  the structural and chemical diversity that these classes of  materials promise, the combination of organic and inorganic  components into a \"dual-network\" assembly opens the  possibility of engineering into one material a composite of  physical properties that are normally only associated with  one type of material or the other. An example of a  potentially interesting \"dualnetwork\" material  would be one  that combines a magnetic inorganic lattice with a conducting  organic network. Despite the tremendous potential, detailed  studies of these types of materials are still quite young.  The proposed research addresses three important questions.  What drives the solid-state structures and how can they be  controlled? If composite properties are desirable, how can  this be achieved? How can coupling of the networks be tuned  to behave separately or in synergy?",
