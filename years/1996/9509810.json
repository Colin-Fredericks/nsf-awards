Aircraft, radar, satellite, radiosonde, and surface  observations of thunder storms from the Convection and  Precipitation/Electricity (CaPE) project will be used.  This  project was conducted near the Kennedy Space Center during the  summer of 1991.  Results from three CaPE case studies completed  under prior funding have shown that ice-phase precipitation, along  with upper-level downdrafts, develop prior to the first indications  of storm electrification.  Negative electric charge is co-located  with areas of precipitation at mid-levels in these storms in their  early to mature phases, although the charge carriers were not  identified.         Data from more than a dozen additional research flights is  available to refine and generalize preliminary conclusions reached  in these three completed studies.  These data will be composited to  yield a more general picture of evolution in Florida thunderstorms.   In collaboration with other workers, interpretation of multi-  parameter radar signatures will be refined using intercomparisons  with in situ aircraft microphysical measurements.  Further analysis  of airborne electric field and airframe discharge data will be  undertaken to reduce uncertainties in electric field retrievals  from in situ airborne measurements.",
