 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623299  Warren    Impurity-species nuclear magnetic resonance  (NMR)  will  be  used   to   investigate  the  local  atomic  and  electronic  structure  of impurities in crystalline semiconductors.  Our  previous  variable-temperature  studies  of  the  donor  and  acceptor bands in Si(P) and Si(B) in the range 100 -  500  K  will  be extended to liquid helium temperatures.  The  group  III  impurities Ga and In in II-VI materials will be studied  by  conventional  impurity-nucleus NMR in  the  presence  of  persistent   photoconductivity  at  low  temperatures.    An  attempt will be made to observe optical nuclear polarization  in  ZnO  and related II-VI materials.  The effect of optical  excitation on the local atomic structure of impurities  such  as  Ga  in CdTe will be examined as a test of the \"DX model\"  of these materials.  %%%  Impurity  atoms  play  a  critical role  in  technologically  important  semiconducting crystals since they introduce  the  charged  carriers  necessary for the  materials  to  conduct  electricity.   Despite  their importance,  the  atomic-scale  environments  of many important impurities are still  poorly  understood.   Nuclear magnetic resonance  (NMR)  provides  a  highly  local, chemically-specific probe which will be  used  in   this   research  to  investigate  the  structural   and  electronic environments of selected impurities in  materials  such  as CdTe and Si.  The state of atoms such as Ga and  In  in  CdTe  and  related  materials  will  receive  particular  attention  in an attempt to understand why these impurities,  contrary   to   conventional  behavior,  do  not   introduce  carriers.   In Si, NMR will be used to clarify  the  way  in  which  interactions between P or B impurities influence  the  carrier mobility and hence, the performance of silicon-based  devices.  ***",
