 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514777  O'Malley    Calcium is a key signaling molecule in the nervous system of  all animals.  In vertebrate animals, calcium levels inside  nerve cells increase when the cells are stimulated.  Increased calcium levels have many different actions inside  nerve cells, ranging from the immediate regulation of the  electrical excitability of the cell to very long term  changes in the cell's behavior, which may be mediated  through alterations of gene expression.  Recently a  technique was developed that allows the imaging of calcium  activity in nerve cells in the brain of intact zebrafish.  This allows measurement of cellular calcium activity in  response to a variety of sensory stimuli and also allows the  investigation of any correlations between these calcium  signals and the behavior of the fish.  This approach  demonstrated that calcium signals in one particular  identified nerve cell in the hindbrain of the zebrafish, the  Mauthner cell, were dramatically enhanced after repetitive  sensory stimulation.  One principal aim of this proposal is  to determine the conditions required to produce this novel  form of enhancement.  This will be accomplished by varying  the timing, intensity and modality of sensory stimulation.  A second major aim is to understand the cellular mechanisms  underlying these large calcium signals. A third aim takes  advantage of the fact that the Mauthner cell is a behavioral  command neuron, which triggers the animal's escape behavior.  This cutting-edge project will demonstrate the molecular  basis for a behavior in a living animal.  The potential  implications are enormous, both for the understanding of the  molecular basis of animal behavior and for the development  of non-invasive measuring techniques in living animals.",
