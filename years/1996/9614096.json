The idea of this  workshop is to bring together world leaders in the emerging  field of soft condensed matter physics to exchange recent  advances in theory and experiment and to introduce this new  discipline to young researchers and students.  The invited  speakers and scientific committee include many world leaders  in this rapidly developing area.  %%%  This proposal is for support of an international conference  entitled \"Fluctuation mediated Interactions in Soft  Condensed Matter \" to be held at Centre de Physique, les  Houches, France on October 14-18, 1996.
