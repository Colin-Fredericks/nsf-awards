 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this GOALI research project is to study  fundamental principles for using advanced sensor, actuation  and decision making methodologies in the design of media  handling system for the next generation of copiers and  printers. Many problems in copiers and printers are due to  malfunctions in the media handling system. These include  paper jams, machine shut downs due to impending paper jams  (soft shutdown), smearing, damage to original documents, and  poor compilation. Current media handling systems are based  upon open-loop control systems and rely on the robustness of  the system's mechanical design. The use of sensors is  limited to the detection of failures and are only used to  trigger a machine shutdown. This joint research project  between the industry (Xerox) and the university (U C  Berkeley) addresses the issues concerned with media handling  in printers and copiers. The research utilizes and makes  advances in: mechatronics, discrete event and hybrid dynamic  systems, identification and adaptive control, intelligent  and reconfigurable control systems, fault detection and  failure recovery, and integrated mechanical design and  control. The result from this research will be deployed in  future copiers and printers. The elimination of jams in  media handling system will improve productivity by reducing  time lost in production. The current yearly lost production  due to time lost is valued at $ 0. 7 Billion. The ability to  handle paper of very wide lattitude serves to reduce cost of  paper manufacturing and encourages the use of the more  economical recycled paper. Finally, this research is of  critical importance for American industries to maintain a  position of technical leadership in the extreme competitive  photocopier and printer markets.",
