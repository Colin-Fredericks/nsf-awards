 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work was begun in 1950 on a descriptive illustrated flora to include the estimated 6000 species of vascular plants native in the Mexican states of Jalisco, Colima, and Aguascalientes, and parts of adjoining states. The first 25 years included both extensive collecting in western Mexico and intensive study to produce treatments of the larger families. Publication of the Flora Novo-Galiciana began in 1983, and to date seven of the projected seventeen volumes have been published, treating almost half of all the species and genera, and a revised edition of the first volume, prepared by the Mexican botanist Patricia Davila, will appear late in 1996. The published parts deal with the conifers, the ferns and their allies, and the monocots, as well as the two largest families of dicots. No other area of Mexico of comparable size and floristic richness has a Flora that approaches such a degree of completion.  One goal for the next three years will be for the project's half-time artist, Karin Douthit, to finish illustrating one species in each genus for the remaining volumes, after which she will retire. Work already begun at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico on a database for plant specimens from western Mexico will also continue. The principal author, Rogers McVaugh, and the editor, W. R. Anderson, assisted by several collaborators, hope to complete two additional volumes of dicots during that period and make substantial progress on the text of a third.  |        H H     + (\u00e1\u2580\u00e1G \u00c0 F G ( n     H H     + (     d            '                       \u2554     @                          -- a\u00dd\u00aa  \u2580                 ;    S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (   \u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1                                    (   +                                                                           \u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1                                                                                                                    \u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1                                                                                                                    \u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1                                                \u00aa\u00e1                          = \u00d3aO\u00c0 h\u00a2\u00b5  +'\u00aa`0   \u00b7           \u00a0       \u00aa               &       ,       8        D       P       X       `       l       \u00d9       \u00b5       \u00f3   \u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1    >   Meredith's MacHD:Applications:Microsoft Word:Templates:Normal         National Science Foundation         National Science Foundation      '@    \u00c3v+=\u00aat @    \u00aa\u00d93^G+ @    \u00aft `G+                 @                   Microsoft Word 6.0.1                 4                ;  \u00e1\u00aa                                 _\u00d0h O+      e               F                       F                                       l       l   l       l       l       l       l       \u00b9       \u00b9       \u00b9       \u00b9       \u00b9       \u00b9       \u00df       \u00b9       +   =   \u00bc       \u00bc       \u00bc       \u00bc       \u00bc       \u00bc       \u00bc       \u00bc                                                           &   h   X   +   J   +                       l       \u00bc                 \u00bc       \u00bc                       \u00bc       \u00bc       +       \u00bc       l       l       \u00bc                       \u00bc       \u00bc       \u00bc       \u00bc       \u00bc       l       \u00bc       l       \u00bc                               \u00c3       \u00db       l       l       l       l       \u00bc               \u00bc   Y   \u00bc",
