 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626173  Spatzier    The proposed research  lies at the interface of differential   geometry and dynamical systems.  A principal goal is to investigate   the dynamical and geometric structures of \"higher rank\" systems.   In particular, the investigator intends to classify hyperbolic   actions of higher rank abelian and semisimple Lie groups or actions  which preserve geometric structures, and also establish other   rigidity properties.  The investigator also plans to study   Riemannian manifolds (especially higher rank ones) and their   geodesic flows.  Both geometric, dynamical and group theoretic   tools are used in this research.    Geometry is one of the oldest fields in mathematics, and generally   studies curves, surfaces and their higher dimensional analogues,   their shapes, shortest paths, and maps between such spaces.   Differential geometry had its roots in cartography, and is now   studied for aesthetic reasons and its close ties with physics and   other sciences and applied areas (computer vision e.g.).  Dynamical   systems is a relatively new field that investigates the evolution   of a physical or mathematical system over time (e.g. turbulence in   a fluid flow).  New ideas and concepts from dynamics (e.g. chaos,   fractals) have changed our perception of the world fundamentally.   Dynamical systems have had a major impact on the sciences and   engineering.  Symbolic dynamics for instance has been instrumental   for developing efficient and safe codes for computer science.    Tools and ideas from smooth dynamics are used as far afield as cell  biology and meteorology.",
