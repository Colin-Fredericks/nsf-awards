 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mathematical Sciences Department has made a commitment to be on the forefront of the current mathematics reform. In line with this commitment, the department is developing a Mathematical Sciences Computer Lab and Resource Center (MCLRC). The purpose of the MCLRC is to provide a central location for students to engage in scholarly activities and discussions; to provide a state-of-the-art facility where students can integrate mathematical theory with visual discovery; to give student groups with different learning styles further opportunities to succeed in mathematics and science; and to develop students' ability to solve sophisticated real-world problems with modern software tools, thereby better preparing them for the work force or graduate school.   In order to realize these goals, this project is modifying existing portions of the current curriculum to make use of several software tools. In particular, this reorganization involves several phases. Phase I consists of incorporating the software tool functions into all sections of precalculus. Phase II is the establishment of the MCLRC and the incorporation of MAPLE into calculus, multivariable calculus, differential equations, and computational linear algebra. Phase III involves the development of a scientific computing course that brings students from the natural sciences together in a seminar type of atmosphere, analyzing and solving problems in their various disciplines using MAPLE and IGOR (data analysis software).   Existing equipment is not sufficient for Phases II and III, therefore, the department is acquiring 20 Power Macintosh computers with networking hardware, 1 Apple share server, 2 portable classroom computers with display equipment, and licenses for MAPLE and IGOR.   The department expects this project to have a significant impact on student retention in the sciences, particularly among Pacific Islanders, and to result in a number of published materials.",
