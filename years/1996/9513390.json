To achieve the specific aim of the current proposal it is necessary to obtain data that will assist in the calculation of the three dimensional structures of known bioadhesives.  Specifically, MAP extracted from the Blue Sea Mussel, (Mytilus edulis) will provide the model compounds.  MAP is composed of  75(85 repeating decapeptide units with the primary sequence NH2-A-K-P-S-Y-HYP-HYP-T-DOPA-K-COOH (Waite et al., 1985).  Since MAP is active at interfaces, it is therefore important to study its behavior while adsorbed to a surface.  Solid-state techniques, such as multiple attenuated internal reflectance infrared (MAIR-IR) spectroscopy, ellipsometry, contact angle analysis, and solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, already have given some structural information about these peptides' abilities, but have not been used to their fullest potential.  These techniques, in addition to crystallization efforts, will be employed to study the decameric repeat unit in addition to other MAP protein fragments (e.g., +NH3-proline-serine-tyrosine-hydroxyproline-hydroxyproline-thereonine-tyrosine-lysine-alanine-lysine-proline-serine-tryosine-hydroxyproline-COOH, and +NH3-proline-serine-tyrosine-hydroxyproline-hydroxyproline-threonine-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine-lysine-alanine-lysine-proline-serine-tyrosine-hydroxyproline-COOH).  Data will be collected for the MAP peptides in both the solid-and solution-states, with the information compiled to create molecular models of the peptides.  The first step of structure elucidation will be to use NMR data to create solution-state models.  The variety of solid-state techniques would then be used to characterize the molecular changes that are responsible for the bioadhesion process.  %%%  The PI has worked to combine research with teaching.  She takes her teaching responsibilities very s eriously, and is dedicated toward providing a learning environment for students that is thorough, yet inviting.  The variety of courses the PI has taught at D'YC reflects her multi-disciplinary background (Introduction to Computers, Statistics, Biochemistry, General Chemistry I-II, Student Research I-II, and Chemistry for the Health Sciences II).  She has prepared a 80+ page hand-out of lecture notes for the biochemistry class has co-authored a manual for the Chemistry for Health Sciences Laboratory and is working on a manual for the Biochemistry laboratory.  To increase availability to the students, she conducts study sessions and distributes her home telephone number.  Some students have attributed some of success to hand-outs distributed, graded homework and oral presentation assignments.  A Biomaterials course will be developed that introduces implantology and describes the methods for choosing and characterizing materials for specific biological applications.  The PI has already developed several new laboratory exercises for her biochemistry laboratory course and will prepare additional exercises that combine science disciplines.  ***",
