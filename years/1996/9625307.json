 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS-9625307    The research focuses on the development of  Holographic Particle Velocimetry (HPV).  The understanding of turbulence phenomena is currently hampered by the lack of capability to obtain time-resolved full-field instantaneous three-dimensional (3-D) flow velocity and vortiaity field data.  Holographic Particle Velocimetry is highly promising to provide this capability.  Current approaches to HPV focus on the solution of one immediate problem (the holographic images vs. speckle noise) and the system configuration are becoming increasingly more complex and user-friendly.  The major bottleneck in the HPV technique, is the huge quantity of data processing, that has not been seriously addressed.   The proposed HPV approach uses two new ideas:  (1) band-pass\" In-line Recording Off-axis Viewing\" holography, which provides both excellent signal-to-noise performance and geometric and operational simplicity, especially in the pulsed-laser hologram recording process, and (2) hybrid optical-digital processing system, characterized by image compression of the order of 1011 achieved by massively parallel optical correlation, offering a potential for substantial reduction of data processing speed.    Besides involving undergraduate students in HPV research, it is planned to introduce optics to Mechanical Engineering curriculum including an instructional optics laboratory and senior design projects.  New learning methodologies using interactive multimedia will be developed for a Fluid Mechanics course.",
