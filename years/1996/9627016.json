 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research explores the importance of asset markets for rent-  seeking behavior and endogenously determined policy in democracies.   Part I shows that access to markets influences individuals' trade-  policy preferences and government policy choices.  Part 2  determines the consequences of this interdependence for human and  physical capital accumulation, growth and fluctuations.  Part 3  examines international lending to economies in transition from  socialist to market systems where rent appropriation by foreign  entrepreneurs arises.  This project will reveal the structure of  asset markets necessary to moderate protectionist interests,  minimize rent-seeking behavior, and further progression towards  market systems in transition economies.  The analysis employs a  formal theoretical framework and implications will be related to  empirical observations.    The interactive component incorporates teaching, research, and  social elements.  A course in international economics is being  offered to graduate students in the first semester, while a  freshman course will be offered on global economic issues in the  second semester.  Participation in the organization of the  International Workshop is ongoing throughout the visit as is  attendance at faculty meetings and departmental social functions.   In addition, initiation of more casual economics discussion groups  at weekly lunches is being promoted.",
