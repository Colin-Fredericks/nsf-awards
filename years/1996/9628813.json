The  Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone (ETSZ) is a pronounced zone of  earthquake activity in a region 300 by 50 km with earthquake  hypocenters extending from 5 to 25 km in depth.  The zone produces  the second highest release of seismic strain energy east of the  Rocky Mountains and is unique in that it is associated with  regional-scale potential-field (gravity and magnetic) anomalies.   Seismic recording of quarry blasts will be done to test the  feasibility of this technique for the study of crustal structure.   Concurrently, analysis and inversion of existing potential field  data will be done.  Seismic and potential-field data analysis will  be integrated to provide a better understanding of structures  responsible for earthquakes within the region and outline the best  approach for further efforts.  This research is a component of the  National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***",
