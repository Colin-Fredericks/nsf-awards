To answer this question, a cloned immortalized cell line of Xenopus melanophores will be used.  The unique properties of these cells make them especially attractive for the proposed study.  First, unlike most other systems, where physiological stimuli triggering the movement of organelles are poorly understood, movement of thousands of pigment granules called melanosomes can easily be manipulated by the addition of the appropriate hormones to the culture medium.  Second, melanosome proteins represent about 10% of the total cellular protein.  Availability of a large number of cells grown in culture and the development of a simple protocol for melanosome purification makes it the system of choice for purification and characterization of the components involved in the motility and for the reconstitution of regulated motility along microtubules in vitro.  Third, phosphorylation of specific sets of proteins during pigment aggregation and dispersion in melanophores has been documented.  Fourth, Xenopus melanophores can be effectively transfected with exogenous DNA.  Thus, using cloned genes that encode proteins that are targets for phosphorylation, the function role of phosphorylation can be analyzed in transgenic cells.  The proposed studies will identify motor proteins that drive anterograde and retrograde movement of organelles in melanophores and in a cell-free system.  Modifications of the motors or other organelle proteins that are associated with the switch in the polarity of these transport processes will be identified and the genes for proteins undergoing modification will be cloned and sequenced.  The functional role of the modifications will be determined by site-directed mutagenesis and the analysis of the phosphorylation state and activities of the modified proteins in vitro and in vivo.      The potential significance of this project extends well beyond the speci fic question of melanosome movement, because similar control mechanisms are likely to operate during mitosis, secretion, axoplasmic transport and the beating of cilia and flagella.  Thus, understanding the regulation of melanosome movement will significantly enhance our knowledge of microtubules work, and will be relevant to a broad range of studies of fundamental aspects of cellular function and malfunction.  ***",
