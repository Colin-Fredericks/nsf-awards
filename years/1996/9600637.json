 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of technologies to support interpretation of  scientific data is a major challenge for bioinformatics. The  information explosion within molecular biology has highlighted  the difficulties in maintaining scientific models that are  consistent--both internally and with the mass of experimental and  theoretical data. Even the most experienced biologists struggle  with the task of integrating their own observations with the  published literature in order to build coherent models. For any  complex biological phenomenon, the large number of relevant  experimental systems and techniques creates a web of biological  knowledge with exponential proportions. It is therefore critical  that computational technologies exist for the representation and  interpretation of multiple, diverse data sources, and for  collaborative scientific interpretation of these data sources. It  is further necessary that the next generation of  bioinformaticians be trained in the creation and extension of  these technologies. The research and education activities  proposed here address both these problems. First, we elaborate a  research plan to build a prototype for the next generation of  structural information resources. The hypothesis of this work is  that computer representations of both scientific hypotheses and  the primary data upon which they are based, can be used to  support multiple activities, including hypothesis formation,  hypothesis exploration and hypothesis testing. Second, we  elaborate a plan for creating a track within the Stanford medical  informatics training program that is specifically geared towards  training students in the methods of bioinformatics.    Dr. Russ Altman is an Assistant Professor in the Section on  Medical Informatics (SMI), within the Department of Medicine at  Stanford. He also holds a courtesy appointment in the Department  of Computer Science. Dr. Altman was recruited to establish a  strong presence of bioinformatics within the SMI, and to focus  the traditional stre ngths of the SMI on important problems in  basic molecular biology. As such, Dr. Altman has focused on the  application of information technology on problems in basic  molecular biology. Dr. Altman's goals for this career development  award are twofold:    1. The first, research goal, is to create a testbed application  for experimenting with the ways in which biologists interact with  structural information. This testbed, called RiboWeb, will be an  integrated knowledge base about the 16S subunit of the  procaryotic ribosome. The knowledge base will contain principled  representations of the published structural data and published  structural models, and will allow the data and the models to be  browsed, evaluated and used for computation. The resource will be  made available over the internet, and will provide immediately  useful functionality for investigators working on this important  structure, as well as allowing students to experiment with new  information organization, storage and retrieval technologies, and  demonstrate their efficacy empirically.    2. The second, educational goal, is to develop a pathway in  bioinformatics at Stanford that provides a general introduction  to the field of bioinformatics, and gives students the skills  necessary to participate in research in projects such as the test  bed application described in the research component. This pathway  will leverage the formal coursework in computer science,  probability and statistics, biology, and social /ethical issues  already provided within the Medical Information Sciences (MIS)  PhD/MS program. In addition, this pathway will provide a new  course within the MIS training program at Stanford, in which  students learn the fundamentals bioinformatics. The unique  affiliation with medical informatics will create a population of  bioinformaticians who are aware of relevant technologies within  other branches of informatics.",
