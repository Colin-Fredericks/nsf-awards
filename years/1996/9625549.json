 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625549  Prange  This grant supports work of this senior, distinguished  theorist whose past contributions have ranged over a variety  of diverse areas in condensed matter physics.  More recently  the PI has been involved in the general area of quantum  nonlinear science.  This subject, on the interface between  quantum disorder problems and such nonlinear properties as  chaos and fractals is expected to have strong influence on  the emerging fields of nanoscale devices.  The PI has been  instrumental in a major conceptual advance in this field,  namely the removal of the divergence in a quasiclassical  approach.  This grant will further develop the applications  of the quasiclassical approach.  In another project the PI  will explore the synergism of the random matrix theory and  the quasiclassical methods in their application to the  properties of disorder at quantum scale.  %%%  Small scale (nanoscale) devices have properties whose  description sometimes poses a special mathematical  challenge.  In this continuing work of a distinguished  theorist, attempts are being made to try a variety of modern  mathematical techniques, such as random matrix theory and  quasiclassical approximation in search of a effective and  efficient computation of the material properties.  This work  will advance the state of quantum nonlinear science.  ***",
