 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program, targets the development of nanostructured gold surfaces  which will be applied to fundamental studies of interfacial  electrochemistry, spectroscopy, and microscopy.  During the tenure  of this thirty-three month standard grant, Professor Michael Natan  and his students at Penn State University will fabricate tailored  gold surfaces by self-assembling nanometer sized gold particles  onto substrates covered with organic or inorganic thin films.   These gold surfaces will then be used for probing the direct  voltammetry of redox enzymes, for the optimization of metal  roughness for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), for  studies of electron transfer through organic films, for SERS  spectroscopy of proteins, for the development of near-field SERS  microscopy, and for the controlled electrochemical release of  molecules from a single nanoelectrode.  Microstructured metal surfaces offer unique properties which can be  advantageously exploited in a broad range of electrochemical,  spectroscopic, and microscopic applications.  Using molecular self-  assembly protocols, Professor Michael Natan and his students at  Penn State University are pioneering techniques for tailoring  microstructured gold surfaces for use in these applications.  The  successful pursuit of the goals of this project should give rise to  significant progress in electrochemical and optical sensors, and  could afford new techniques in near-field optical microscopy.",
