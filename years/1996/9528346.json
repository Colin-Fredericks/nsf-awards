Clotfelter    This study will examine the effects of brood parasitism by  brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) on the reproductive  success of red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) and  evaluate the importance of this selective pressure in  modifying host behavior.  Fieldwork will be conducted during  March-July of 1996 and 1997 on a prairie-nesting population  of red-winged blackbirds in Rock County, Wisconsin.  This  study has four aims.  (1) Redwing nest defense effort will  be measured using mounted female cowbirds presented at 3  distances from the nest.  Vigilance by male redwings will  also be related to the probability of parasitism.  These  data will be used to assess the extent to which redwing  behavior has evolved as a response to cowbird parasitism.  (2) The effect of cowbird egg-removal on redwing  reproductive success will also be examined by combining  clutch manipulations with experimental parasitism.  (3)  Redwing parental investment will be compared between  parasitized (exposed to cowbird mount) and unparasitized  (not exposed to cowb ird mount) nests.  (4) Empirical  estimates of redwing quality will be measured in the field  and compared between parasitized and unparasitized nests,  and data from 1983-1997 nest records will be used to  determine if parasitized nests have intrinsically higher  success rates than unparasitized nests. Nest success of  naturally- and experimentally-parasitized nests will be  compared to further test this host quality hypothesis.  Results from this study will be widely applicable to other  avian host/parasite systems, including sensitive species  where experimental manipulation is impractical or  impossible.  By studying the dynamics of this relationship  between closely-related species we can gain greater insight  into the evolution of obliga te interspecific brood  parasitism.",
