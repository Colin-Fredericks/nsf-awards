Most of the proposed research is part of a broader program to  illuminate the connections between analytic ideas such as differential  operators and $L^2$-estimates with characteristic $p$ techniques in  commutative algebra such as tight closure. The goals of the proposed  research are: (1) to apply characteristic $p$ techniques towards a  solution of Fujita's Conjecture in algebraic geometry; (2) to  understand vanishing theorems for cohomology of line bundles on complex  varieties in terms of tight closure; (3) to study the ring theoretic  properties of differential operators on non-smooth varieties by using  reduction to characteristic $p$ methods; and (4) to study a particular  instance where there appears to be a direct link between $D$-modules  and modules with an action of Frobenius. Parts (I) and (II) of the  Career Development Plan outline specific methods by which the research  will be conducted. The main tools are closure operations on ideals,  such as the tight closure and the integral closure, and the Frobenius  action on local cohomology. A computer project suitable for a graduate  student is proposed as a method for understanding the module structure  of a ring over its ring of differential operators.        Part (III) proposes a four year plan to teach both graduate and  undergraduate students projective algebraic geometry and computer  algebra while engaging them in state of the art research.    The proposed project is a greatly expanded version of research already  in progress on sparse systems of parameters and Noether Complexity.  This long term research and educational project includes plans for a  new graduate course at the University of Michigan stressing the use of  computers in algebraic geometry, and for a junior level seminar for  majors in mathematics and computer scien ce in which teams of  undergraduate students led by a graduate student learn projective  geometry through self-discovery.  The research begun in this seminar  will be expanded to a full scale research project on computer algebra.  This project will culminate in a conference in which students present  their findings to a broader audience.     Part (IV) addresses the educational and human resources aspects of  thePIs career goals. A program to bring real-life practitioners of  mathematics in business and industry to the undergraduate classroom is  proposed. The objectives are to simultaneously motivate the curriculum  and introduce students to people like themselves who have used  mathematics to create a successful career.",
