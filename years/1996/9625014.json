 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates formalization and automation techniques for design of  asynchronous systems.  Techniques for design of asynchronous systems.  Techniques  for managing multiple, independently synchronized domains under a methodology in  which timing and communication can be explicitly specified, synthesized, and  verified are being explored.  specific tools and techniques being developed for  the design of mixed-timed systems include: a performance and power optimizing  compiler; a synthesis tool to produce technology-independent circuits; a  technology mapping tool that takes the implementation and maps it to high-  performance gate libraries; and a timing verification tool.  In addition, new  design methods are being developed to produce: high-performance mixed-timed data  paths, and an interface between synchronous and asynchronous modules.    The PI's education plan includes:  curriculum emphasis on communication skills  through course project reports and presentations; development of new computer  engineering courses; promoting interdisciplinary activities; incorporating  research activities into the curriculum through class and summer projects; and  fostering interaction with industry through student summer internships.",
