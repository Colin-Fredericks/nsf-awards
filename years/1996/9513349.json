 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the use of yeast strains to express enzymes   of general utility in organic synthesis. The specific oxidative enzymes   to be studied include cyclohexanone monooxygenase, flavin monooxygenase   and cytochrome P-450's. These enzymes will not require cofactors and will   be the equivalent of a chiral m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid in a form that   will be as easy to use as the achiral reagent itself. They will be   applicable to carry out such transformations as olefin epoxidations,   thioether oxidations (to chiral sulfoxides) and Baeyer-Villiger   reactions. With this award the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting   the research of Dr. Jon D. Stewart of the Department of Chemistry of the   University of Florida. Professor Stewart will focus his work on   yeast-expressed enzymes designed to carry out enantioselective reactions   in organic synthesis. Besides formation of optically active products   which are useful for the preparation of stereochemically complex systems   that have important biological properties, these enzymes all use   molecular oxygen, rather than an organic oxidant, which makes them   attractive from both an economic and environmental standpoint",
