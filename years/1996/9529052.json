 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine the relationships between physical theories, using both a very technical examination of the mathematics and a more philosophic reflection on the implications of those mathematical relationships.  The purpose of this investiagtion is to reach new philosophic understandings about the nature of physical theories and to develop new insights into relationships between theories, such as reduction and explanation.  To do this the PI will use recent advances in the mathematics of asymptotic expansions to examine the properties of functions that describe physical theories as a fundamental parameter of the theory (say, Planck's constant) approaches a limiting value.  Since it is often the case that one physical theory represents the limiting case of another--a kind of intertheoretic reduction--this examination will offer new insights into the meaning of reductive relationships between theories.  From all this technical analysis the PI will then draw inferences about the nature of theories and their relationship that have general utility in the philosophy of science.",
