 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biology students do not receive sufficient hands-on experience in modern experimental techniques or in the interpretation of data derived from these techniques. The equipment used in this project, along with other equipment recently acquired, provides meaningful laboratory experiences utilizing current technologies for students planning careers as scientists or technicians.   The use of computers is simplifying and enhancing data analysis and manipulation, providing students with a rapid visual representation of the results. This project facilitates the incorporation of current and powerful techniques such as polymerase chain reaction, nucleic acid hybridization, monoclonal antibodies, and fluorescent probes into instructional laboratories and undergraduate research. The project can improve research opportunities and outcomes for minority students at the university and at minority institutions in Memphis that have cooperative research programs with the university. The new equipment can also be used for undergraduate research and the training of area high school teachers, talented high school students, and undergraduates from other institutions in the Mid-South.   The impact of the project can be evaluated by monitoring the number of students, particularly women, minorities, and persons with disabilities, who major in the division, choose to enter graduate school or B.S.-level employment in science-related areas, apply for and receive research awards, or participate in undergraduate research. Dissemination of results can occur through publications in journals concerned with science education, through the educational divisions of professional societies, and through undergraduate research presentations at professional meetings.",
