 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Brooklyn Campus of Long Island University is in downtown  Brooklyn and serves mostly commuting students who live in  the area.  Nearly all undergraduates are first generation  college students; 59% are of African-American and Hispanic  origin; and 70% are women.  Many are unprepared to succeed  in the sciences.  Our project is to redesign the  introductory level physics course taken by most of the non-  science majors, a population that includes a large number of  education majors who are teachers in the New York  Metropolitan area.  The course will utilize current  methodologies that support student-centered learning journal  writing, ethnography, collaborative learning, and study  skills.  The project will have these objectives:  1)  preparation  of material  for  a  student-centered, active  learning course;  2) preparation of faculty to teach the  course; and 3)   enhancement of students' academic and  personal  self-confidence as  future scientists,  educators,  and citizens.  The course is being developed with the  participation of NYC Alliance, an NSF-funded Alliance for  Minority Participation (CAMP) Program.  It will be  disseminated to serve as a model and resource for other  colleges.",
