 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to establish an interdisciplinary  research program at Iowa State University (ISU) in the detection  of biomolecular forces using the principles of atomic force  microscopy (AFM). This goal will be accomplished by the formation  of a collaborative research group at ISU that is composed of  scientists from the Department of Zoology & Genetics and the  Department of Chemistry, evolving to include collaborations with  investigators in other ISU departments. The central focus of  research will be the detection and measurement of the binding  forces operative in the interactions between relatively simple  (e.g., amino acids) and more complex (e.g., short peptides,  protein/nucleic acid, antibody-antigen) biomolecular systems. The  information gained from these investigations will provide  important insight into the binding modes related to the molecular  recognition, self-assembly, and folding of biomolecular systems.  Furthermore, these studies will enhance the implementation of  emerging molecular force detection techniques in bioanalytical  diagnostics.           The development of this program is divided into three  interrelated projects, all of which seek to take advantage of the  ability of AFM and its variants to probe interfacial  architectures at nanometer length scales. The three projects are:    Project 1: Tip-Substrate Modification Methods. This project  focuses on the development of new, or the extension of existing,  methods for the chemical and biological modification of AFM tips.  Approaches will also be devised for the construction of spatially  patterned surfaces as platforms for the preparation of small,  localized arrays of different molecular species.    Project 2: Molecular Force Interactions. This project  investigates the molecular level interactions of biological  materials through AFM-force characterizations using the materials  created in Project 1. The project starts with characterizations  under a variety of contacting liquids (e.g., organic sol vents and  biological media) of model chemical systems (e.g., -CO2H, -CH3),  progresses to increasingly complex systems (e.g., amino acids,  short peptides), and culminates with studies of the biomolecular  force interactions between supermolecular domains (e.g., the  leucine zipper) and whole molecules (e.g., antibody/antigen  complexes).    Project 3: The BioMolecular Force Microscope (BMFM). This project  entails the construction of a first generation AFM that is  designed specifically for the detection and measurement of forces  between biological materials. The BMFM will be based on  established design principles for molecular force detection and  on the findings in Projects 1 and 2.           To carry out the above projects, funding is requested for  instrumentation acquisition and construction, and for partial  support of personnel and supplies associated with the design,  development, operation, and maintenance of the instrumentation.  As part of the institutional costsharing, ISU will provide  support for instrumentation and for several of the research and  training activities for the development of this program. This  support extends well past the recommended 50% cost share by NSF,  demonstrating the high level of commitment by ISU to the  initiation and growth of the program.",
