 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC) is an ensemble  of 16 small computer science research conferences, symposia and  workshops, sponsored by four different professional societies and  colocated in Philadelphia, PA from May 20 through 28, 1996.  Many  of the constituent meetings are held on an annual basis. The  purpose of the Federated Conference is to stimulate interaction  among scientists in sub-disciplinary areas who might otherwise  not communicate with one another. Registrants at FCRC are allowed  and encouraged to attend any and all sessions of the constituent  meetings. The first FCRC was held in 1993 in San Diego, CA and  proved to be successful.  The content of FCRC will be enriched by  five plenary sessions featuring internationally distinguished,  invited speakers.  ***",
