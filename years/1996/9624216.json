 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lanzetta  9624216  The research to be carried out focuses on the gaseous extent of galaxies and the origin of Quasi-Stellar Object (QSO) absorption systems.  The foundation for carrying out the research is an existing imaging and spectroscopic survey of faint galaxies in the fields of the Hubble Space Telescope spectroscopic target QSOs.  The goal of the survey is to probe the gaseous extent of galaxies and the origin of Lyman alpha spectral line absorption systems by directly comparing redshifts of galaxies and absorbers along common lines of sight.  Nearly 2000 faint objects in 25 fields have already been targeted with low-resolution optical spectroscopy.  A wide variety of follow-up observations of galaxies identified in the survey have already been obtained, including broad-band optical and infrared imaging, broad-band, high-resolution optical imaging, and high-resolution optical spectroscopy.  Additional follow-up observations of galaxies identified in the survey are planned, including 21 cm radio spectroscopy observations and wide-field, low-resolution optical spectroscopy.  The existing and planned observations will constitute an enormously rich data set that was designed for the purpose of providing new insights into many different aspects of the relationship between galaxies and absorption systems.  The observations and measurements characterize, in more or less as much detail as is possible, the properties of an unbiased sample of galaxies that by chance occur near lines of sight to bright background QSOs.  This allows  one to obtain unique measurements of the presence or absence of corresponding Lyman alpha absorption lines.  The potential application of these observations and measurements is enormous, not only from the perspective of the relationship between galaxies and absorbers, but also from the perspective of faint galaxies generally.  Specifically, the observations and measurements will be used to determine how the incidence and extent of tenuous gas around galaxies depends on  the luminosity, mass, morphological type, stellar population and star formation history, and large-scale environment of the galaxies.  The luminosity function of Lyman alpha absorbing galaxies will be derived.  This is a crucial quantity that links the number density of Lyman alpha absorbers with the number counts and redshift distribution of faint galaxies.  Galaxy and absorber pairs are also of interest because they provide a new and utterly unique dynamical probe of galaxies that extends far beyond conventional rotation curves and can be applied to determine the dark matter content of galaxies to unprecedented spatial scales and redshifts.  The education plan focuses on the development of a new course and textbook to teach quantitative reasoning skills to non-science majors and the development of a new program to involve undergraduate students and high school students in astronomical research.  The goal is to exploit the natural tendency of students in all areas of study to take an interest in astronomical topics to teach concrete, tangible skills drawn from the areas of applied physics, applied mathematics, and applied statistics.  The new course is entitled \"Impacts in the Solar System\" and is specifically aimed at non-science majors who have had minimal but some background in physics, mathematics, or statistics.  The objective of the course is to apply simple yet rigorous quantitative reasoning to a variety of problems related to impacts in the solar system, concentrating especially on terrestrial impacts and their consequences for evolution of life on Earth, but also covering impacts on other solar system objects.  The objective of the program of undergraduate research is to allow students from all areas of study particularly those who will not become professional researchers to benefit from the experience of conducting research.",
