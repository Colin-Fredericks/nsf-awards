In particular, the Chief Justice's ability to assign the majority opinion is considered one of the Chief's most important sources of power.  Previous research has demonstrated that the each justice's assignments depend on such factors as the experience of the justice, the ideological relationship between the justice and the Chief Justice, and the size of the majority coalition.  The P.I.s previous work is to date the only study to model the relative influence of these factors.  This research will extend the previous work by capturing variation over time.  The study will examine the extent to which assignments made by the Chief Justice reflect personal policy preferences and organizational needs of the Court.  It will use original conference data on assignments from 1953-1009.  %%%%  The broad discretion exercised by U.S. Supreme Court justices has led scientific students of the Court to recognize that the justice who write a majority opinion had a disproportionate ability to shape outcomes and establish precedents.
