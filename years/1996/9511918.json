 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511918 Ash    As a result of Nazi racist policies, some of the most important psychologists in Germany and Austria were among the thousands of German-speaking academics and professionals forced to leave their positions and seek new lives, mainly in Britain and the United States, during the 1930s.  Dr. Ash is examining what impact this forced migration had on the scientific and professional work of these psychologists, and how they interacted with the scientific and professional norms prevailing in the places to which they went.  He aims to combine collective studies of  migr  psychologists' career patterns with detailed studies of scientific and professional change among individuals and groups to arrive at an overview of  migr s' roles in shaping -- and being shaped by -- a changing discipline. The project includes broad-based social-historical analysis of the  migr s as a group with fine-grained studies of scientific changed in leading schools of psychological thought and research.  He is addressing such issues as the support system available to the  migr s and the priorities governing such support; the transfer not only of theories, but also of modes of scientific practice and the creation of new research and professional styles; the role of  migr s in the emergence of clinical psychology; and the ways in which, for many  migr s, scientific discourse became a medium for converting personal experiences of loss into theoretical innovation.",
