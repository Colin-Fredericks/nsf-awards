 "awd_abstract_narration": "9601855  Varde    The Department of Mechanical Engineering will acquire three ites for combustion research:  (1) a programmable dynamometer which is capable of loading the test engine to simulate transient conditions encountered by vehicles, (2) a particle image velocimetry (PIV) system that can measure velocity at thousands of points in a plane at any instant and provide quantitative results for an entire flow field, and (3) REGA FT-IR analyzer designed to measure various regulated and unregulated components on a real-time basis in exhaust gas from combustion engines.    The proposed instrumentation along with the existing equipment and test facilities will support basic and applied research in engine combustion, exhaust emission, fuels (including alternate fuels), combustion modeling for engine design, and automotive vapor compression refrigeration cycle.    The faculty members are also involved in developing specialized courses in combustion engines and fuels for practicing engineers in automotve industry.  The equipment sought in the proposal will help in the training of engineers in engine and fuel systems design and development.  ***",
