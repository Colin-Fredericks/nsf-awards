 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clark U.   This proposal is for research which examines the middle ground between general beliefs and specific reasons for economic action using the discourses of actors in New England's industrialization (1790-1860) as case material.  The social theoretic research uses an intra-regional study of economic actors and involves three types of analysis.  First, a clarification of the philosophical-theoretical notion of the cultural-discursive formation of economic rationality is intended which will culminate in a `cultural order of production` concept.  Second, new historical research will be initiated on the discursive constitution of early economic actors in New England and the cultural construction of economic forms.  Third, the work will synthesize theory with empirical findings in a cultural production of New England industrialization.  The main empirical research involves distinct types of modern manufacturing systems which have emerged from the pre-industrial New England moral economy.  Local history work will be carried out in several towns where small producers rapidly became modern capitalist entrepreneurs.  The research is significant because it shows that economic activities have cultural origins.  Second, the work will place regional economic development in a broader cultural framework.",
