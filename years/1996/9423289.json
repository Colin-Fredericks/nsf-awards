 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423289  Nelson       The possibility that atomic chlorine concentrations in the  marine surface layer are large enough to compete with hydroxyl  radical (OH) as the major tropospheric oxidizer continues to  receive considerable speculation.  Chlorine atoms participate in  the oxidation of hydrocarbons, dimethyl sulfide, and can also  directly influence tropospheric ozone loss through catalytic  cycles with chlorine monoxide (ClO) and hydroperoxy (HO2)  radicals.  The net effect on the ozone budget may be highly  dependent on the partitioning of the inorganic chlorine pool  between four chlorine-containing gases; hydrogen chloride (HCl),  hypochlorous acid (HOCl), molecular chlorine (Cl2), and chlorine  nitrate (ClONO2).  To assess the potential importance of chlorine  chemistry in the lower atmosphere, direct measurements of these  species are necessary.  In Phase I of this research, the  feasibility of detecting both HCl and HOCl down to the 10 to 20  part-per-trillion (pptv) concentration range by tunable diode  infrared laser absorption was demonstrated.       The Phase II research effort will improve the basic  spectroscopic parameters for quantifying HOCl concentrations in  the atmosphere, and develop and construct a prototype field  instrument capable of simultaneous measurements of HCl and HOCl  in the marine troposphere.  This new instrument will be  laboratory tested and evaluated against existing, albeit  nonselective, inorganic chlorine techniques in an  intercomparison.       The instrumentation produced as a result of this research  program will be useful for measuring other trace gases in  addition to HCl and HOCl.  The novel long path, multiple pass  absorption cell developed during this project will have  independent commercialization potential for other laser  absorption systems used to monitor industrial pollutants, toxic  wastes, and various gases emitted from combustion processes.",
