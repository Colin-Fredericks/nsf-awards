 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Creary of Notre   Dame University will investigate the mechanisms regarding the novel   heterocyclic compound formation derived from allowing halodiazirines to   react with the xanthate ion. Further, attempts will be made to generate   C-centered diazirinyl anions and to determine their thermal stability.   This is of interest as these compounds are antiaromatic anions. Finally,   the project will investigate the means to expand the scope of the   beta-lactam forming reaction that was recently discovered by the author.  Synthetic sequences which are new and yield novel products of general   interest provide scientists with alternatives to new drugs and materials.   This project addresses this point and describes further how these   concepts can be used to generalize the methodology. Namely, a mechanistic   understanding of the reaction will enable scientists to generalize and   expand the scope of the original discovery. Since these heterocyclic   compounds involve nitrogen, they are physiologically significant",
