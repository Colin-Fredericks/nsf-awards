The meeting will take place July 12 - 14, 1996 in Knoxville, Tennessee, immediately prior to the 8th International Congress on Molecular-Plant Microbe Interactions.  The meeting has two objectives: (A) to present a discussion of tools for genetic and molecular analysis, plus selected advances which have applied these approaches, and (B) to foster communication and interactions among researchers working on diploid annual legumes as model systems.  The format for the gathering will include invited and contributed talks and discussion sections.  Several means are planned to communicate the proceedings of the conference, including a meeting review article in The Plant Cell and the establishment of a home page for model legumes  The last five years have seen an increased interest in model systems to facilitate genetic and molecular genetic analysis of development in legumes.  This meeting will bring together researchers from all over the world to discuss how to coordinate activities of all interested parties.",
