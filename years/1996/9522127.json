 "awd_abstract_narration": "Barbara Wyslouzil is funded by a Small Grant for Exploratory Research to   study the chemical enrichment which takes place on the surface of liquid   aerosol droplets.   The phenomenon to be studied, i.e., surface   enrichment in aerosol droplets of a binary liquid mixture, has been   predicted but never directly observed.  A supersonic nozzle which can   produce monodispersed aerosol droplets has been developed by Wyslouzil,   and will be used in a collaborative research efforts involving the use of   the Small Angle Neutron Scattering facility in Grenoble, France to   perform the studies.  Wyslouzil will also be collaborating with   researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories on the project.    Surface enrichment has an important effect on heterogeneous chemistry,   growth and evaporation kinetics, and nucleation.  Multicomponent,   nanometer-sized aerosols are produced by nucleation and condensation in   many industrial and natural settings.  Fine refractory aerosols form in   combustion and metallurgical processes while sulfuric acid  - water   aerosols are produced in stack gases, volcanic plumes, and as byproducts   of photochemical reactions in the atmosphere.  The surface composition of   these particles can strongly affect heterogeneous reactions, growth and   evaporation kinetics.",
