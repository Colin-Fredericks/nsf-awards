 "awd_abstract_narration": "While Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory provides a broad and flexible framework   for the formalization of mathematics, recent proof-theoretic research has   shown that a good deal of day-to-day mathematical argumentation correlates   more closely with much weaker subsystems of second-order arithmetic. In   this project Avigad will use model-theoretic techniques to explore the   finitary combinatorial consequences of these theories. This includes   finding Ramsey-theoretic independences akin to the Paris-Harrington   theorem, and developing a combinatorial, model-theoretic approach to   ordinal analysis.    The aim of mathematical logic is to create formal models that describe   various aspects of mathematical practice, and apply mathematical   techniques to the analysis of these models. Since the beginning of   this century, two conflicting and antagonistic views of mathematics   have shared an uneasy coexistence. From a classical point of view,   mathematics is \"about\" the infinite, yielding powerful and compelling   abstractions. From a constructive point of view, mathematics must   always have some concrete, computational meaning, from which it   derives its applicability. This project aims to obtain a better   understanding of the interplay between these two aspects of   mathematical practice, through the formal exploration of infinitary   assumptions and their finite, combinatorial consequences.",
