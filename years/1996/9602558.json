 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Blandy Experimental Farm (BEF) is a 700 acre field  station, owned and operated by the University of Virginia  since 1926 for the purpose of supporting field research.  The BEF is not involved in agricultural research.  The BEF  preserves a diversity of habitats characteristic of the  Ridge and Province Region, as well as a diverse array of  successional fields. The BEF is unique among field  stations because of i) its proximity to the large  scientific community in the Washington, D.C. area; ii) the  presence of a large, and mature Arboretum on-site (the  State Arboretum of Virginia); iii) its proximity to a  large array of pristine montane and aquatic habitats; iv)  the ability of researchers to establish field experimental  plots/gardens in close proximity to greenhouse and growth  chamber facilities; and v) an extensive public education  and outreach program. Research at the Farm has led to more  than 70 student theses (25 in the last ten years). Thirty-  five research projects (involving more than 32 Ph.D.  researchers) have recently been completed or are ongoing.  The ability of the BEF to support new and ongoing research  is currently limited by inadequate housing facilities for  researchers.  This project will initiate development of a  new residence complex and construct two 2-bedroom  apartments for researchers.  Twenty different researchers  representing at least 22 separate research projects would  benefit from expanded on-site housing.",
