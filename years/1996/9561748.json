 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I proposal utilizes two emerging technologies to produce a high resolution, tunable spectrometer with no moving parts. A small, solid state high resolution spectrometer with the unique imaging capabilities provided by a CID is a perfect solution to many problems ranging from process spectroscopy, where a spectroscopic analyzer is used on a production line to `remote sense` an industrial process. To the problems facing the space sciences, in particular NASA's initiatives to develop lower budget spacecraft capable of answering unresolved questions while fiscally and educationally benefiting the greatest number of Americans. As well as uses in ground-based optical aeronomy, where smaller budgets are forcing new instrumentation. Instruments with expanded capabilities that are fully automated and capable of surviving in harsh environments. The LC-FPS design capitalizes on the technology of a major liquid crystal vendor to grow precision nematic crystals onto the surface of traditional etalon plates and to control etalon resonant wavelength by application of a controllable electric field. The innovative spectrometer proposed features the highest spectral resolution and throughput of any instrument in its class, permitting not only abundance measurements but also dynamically measurements. so important to ongoing research in planetary and cometary atmospheres.       The LC-FPS is an ideal tool for problems ranging from:  1) The remote sensing of regulated environmental pollutants  2) Augmenting current aeronomical instrumentation at major national facilities.  3.) A replacement for current laboratory FTIR spectroscopy systems commonly used in molecular biology and biochemistry.  4.) An essential tool in any field that utilizes spectroscopic remote sensing or process spectroscopy.",
