 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Research at Undergraduate Institution (RUI)  project. This project will investigate both the techniques  for combining optimizations in compilation  and the  potential benefit of applying combined optimizations. A  determination of when optimizations can be combined has not  been discovered. Likewise, a tool to automatically generate  an optimizer for these more powerful combined optimizations  has not been developed. The objectives of this ongoing  project are: investigate the properties of optimizations  that permit their combination, describe when two  optimizations may be combined, and propose a tool which  generates an optimizer for the newly combined optimizations.  A generalization of the description to combine chains of  optimizations will also be investigated.    This project will be used as a vehicle to introduce  undergraduate students to the research process and actively  involve students in the theoretical investigation, the  implementation, the experimentation, and the dissemination  of the results. Students will be encouraged to involve  themselves in all aspects of this project.  ***",
