 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514809  Sobel    The studies described in the proposal are linked by the idea that  intelligently designed institutions may perform well even if  individual participants are boundedly rational, and that a  measure of an institution's success is how well it performs when  agents make mistakes.  The proposal contains several related  projects.  One project studies auction mechanisms to extend the  ideas, introduced by others, that these markets do not rely on  optimizing behavior to operate efficiently.  The goal is to prove  that prices converge to the competitive price when participants  are budget constrained but unsophisticated, and to identify a  class of internally consistent, adaptive behaviors that generate  efficient outcomes in complicated auction environments.  Another  project analyzes a mechanism design problem with two-dimensional  output in order to determine how the ability to observe one  component influences the product of the second.  Two studies  focus on the relationship between poorly informed agents and  experts.  One model describes the function of a market in which  agents must select an expert, either from information supplied  through advertisements or word of mouth.  The other investigates  when a boundedly rational agent should delegate decision making  authority to an expert.  For the most part, the techniques are  standard tools from game theory and the theory of mechanism  design; in particular, incomplete information will be the primary  reason that agents cannot make perfect decisions.",
