 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a three year award proposed by Dr. Chung-Chiun Liu,  the Case Western University and Dr. Yao Cheng, the  Synchrotron Radiation Center (SRRC) in Hsinchu, Taiwan. This  proposal requests travel funds to support research  cooperation between these two institutes for exploring and  developing the application of deep X-ray lithography in the  formation of microsensors and other microstructures.  The  LIGA process, first developed in Germany, has demonstrated  unique capabilities for creating a wide variety of  microstructures through precision lithography.  It is an  important technology and can have a major impact on many  aspects of modern life.  The integration of LIGA, sensors  and actuators can benefit a large range of microfabrication  industries.   The number of investigators engaged in this  area of research is limited in the United States.  Dr. Liu  is an expert in the microfabrication of sensors, uniquely  suited for carrying out this cooperation.   The synchrotron  system in Taiwan is a state-of-the-art facility and will  provide beam time and structure flexibility for this  project.  This is a unique opportunity not generally  available from the U.S. facilities.   This project is  jointly funded by the Taiwan National Science Council, which  is providing the logistical costs, while the NSF supports  the investigator's travel.",
