 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   program provides continued support to research by Dr. Thomas P. Onak of   the Chemistry Department, California State University at Los Angeles,   concerning the chemistry of cage compounds of carbon and boron, called   carboranes.  The reactions that will be investigated are: (a) selective,   progressive, cage opening with nucleophiles such as fluoride ion, amines,   phosphine, and hydride ion; (b) the syntheses of new carboranes; (c) the   syntheses of new substituted carboranes that exhibit different modes of   bonding and structure; (d) the influence of a variety of attached groups   on the mechanism of rearrangement of substituted carboranes; (e)   equilibration studies involving isomeric substituted carboranes to assess   cage stabilizing and destabilizing influences of various substituents;   (f) a study of net front-side cage displacement reactions; (g) the   examination and delineation of products from the reaction of diborane   with nido carborane anions; (h) the applicaton of MP-NMR computational   methods, including IGLO, GIAO, and FPT, for the comparison of predicted   NMR structural assignments to experimental data.  Carboranes form large molecular structures with unusual bonding and   structural characteristics.  Insight about the behavior of such clusters   is potentially applicable to other large molecular structures, including   those found in electronic materials.  Attention will  be paid to   developing a theoretical framework for interpreting the experimental   results.  The work will be carried out primarily by undergraduate students",
