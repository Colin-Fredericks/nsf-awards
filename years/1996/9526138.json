 "awd_abstract_narration": "9526138  Rogers        Coastal mountains form a barrier to the wind field that may affect  both the downstream and upstream evolution of the local air flow.  Local  regions of high or low pressure generated by the coastal zone can become  trapped and propagate along the coastline.  Energetic, disturbances that  exist for between two and six days are of particular interest. These  features can cause significant changes in the local weather in the  coastal zone, for example, replacing clear skies with clouds and fog, and  causing intensification and reversals of the wind field. These systems  are well documented, but no studies have characterized their dynamical  structure, origin, interaction with the mean boundary layer and the  development of the cloud-capped layer that accompanies these events.        Accelerations of the flow associated with coastal barriers give  rise to strong wind forcing of the coastal ocean and rapid variations in  the speed of the low level air flow.  These orographically-forced flows  have a significant effect on the exchange of heat, moisture, momentum and  trace constituents between the ocean and the atmosphere. Since these  flows are constrained by the topography, they are often stationary and  persistent, consistently affecting a particular area of the coastline.   While the basic structure of these features is known, they have been  documented on only a few occasions and no systematic study has been  directed specifically to identifying the dynamics of these features and  their interactions with the thermal circulation that is also a  significant mesoscale feature of the summer-time California coastal zone.        This work will focus on in situ measurements of the along shore and  across shore structure of the boundary layer using aircraft and surface  based measurements.  Aircraft instruments will provide direct  measurements of the mean and turbulent structure of the coastal  atmosphere with coincident lidar measurements of the deformation of the  marine bounda ry layer inversion and in situ cloud microphysical  measurements of coastal clouds and aerosols.  An important result will be  the ability to resolve the temporal and spatial scales that dominate the  variability of the mesoscale wind field along parts of the California  coast, which may have a significant impact of mesoscale forecasting and  numerical modeling in complex terrain.  ***",
