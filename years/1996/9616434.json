The infrastructure mission of the Center will be to transfer learning technologies developed at Northwestern to teachers, and content learning for applications to science, mathematics, and technology education in schools, homes, and workplaces.  Its research mission, to be carried out collaboratively with these teachers and content experts, will be to develop and investigate tools and technologies for the design and implementation of education software that truly are transferable - i.e., tools and technologies that teachers and content experts can really use, even if they are not expert programmers, to develop new, high quality educational software applications that meet the needs of their students in science, mathematics and technology.",
