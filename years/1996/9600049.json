 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program will continue to extend post-Newtonian  calculations of gravitational radiation to the highest  practicable order, with the goal of developing more accurate  and reliable theoretical templates for gravitational  radiation observatories, as well as of achieving deeper  understanding of Einstein's equations as applied to highly  dynamical, strong-gravity situations.  This effort will  involve (i) formal theoretical work on the foundations of  such approximation methods, (ii) specific calculation of  higher-order effects in both the gravitational radiation and  the equations of motion, and (iii) development of an  interface between the post-Newtonian methods and those of  numerical relativity, which must be used to analyze the late  inspiral and merger of the two bodies.    Inspiralling binary systems of neutron stars or black holes  are promising sources of gravitational radiation detectable  by kilometer-scale, laser-interferometric gravitational  observatories, such as the US LIGO and Italian-French VIRGO  projects, scheduled to be completed by the end of this  decade.  Detection and study of this radiation will open a  new field of gravitational-wave astronomy, and provide  important new tests of general relativity.  In order to make  maximum use of the output of these detectors, it is crucial  to have on hand extremely accurate gravitational-waveform  \"templates\":  detailed theoretical predictions from general  relativity of the shape and frequency evolution of the waves  for ranges of source parameters.  These templates will be  used as \"filters\" to extract from the noisy output of the  detectors useful information such as whether or not  gravitational waves are detected, and the intrinsic  characteristics of the source, such as its direction and  distance, and the masses and spins of its components.  For  all but the final, strongly general relativistic coalescence  of the two bodies, theoretical methods based on successive  \"post-Newtonian\" approximations to general re lativity have  proved to be extremely valuable in developing these  templates.",
