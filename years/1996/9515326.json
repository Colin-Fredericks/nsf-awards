 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a cooperative research project between Professor Theodore R. Tauchert, Department of Engineering Mechanics, University of Kentucky, and Professors V. E. Verijenko and S. Adali, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Natal, Durban, South Africa.  The investigators will study the development and application of an improved and generalized `higher-order` theory for the structural analysis of laminated plates and shells, one that accounts for nonlinear material characteristics, thermal and piezoelectric behaviors, and large deformations and dynamic effects.  The anticipated results will help ensure the safe operation of modern laminated structures, including `smart` structural systems of the future.    The research project is the result of a planning visit undertaken by the PI in 1995.  Costs for the South African portion of the research are being borne by the South Africa Foundation for Research Development.  The PI plans to take a graduate student or postdoctoral fellow with him to South Africa.  During the course of the project, eight graduate students and postdoctoral fellows from South Africa will participate in the research.",
