 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS 9626115  Morgan     This project examines design problems for comparing a set of   treatments under a variety of blocking structures.  The simplest of   these is that of a single blocking variable which partitions   n experimental units into blocks of  k units each, k being less than   the total number of treatments. It has long been believed that a   necessary condition for a good design for this structure is that    the assignment be binary. This project is expanding the scope for   which the alternative idea of  nonbinary  treatment assignment can   yield  good designs, where \"good\" may be expressed in terms of the   standard mathematically formulated optimality criteria    and, in some cases, ability of the design to maintain important   treatment structure in the information matrix. For situations with   more than one blocking factor present, the range of conceivable   relationships among them is quite large. The investigator is also   studying the interplay between nesting, crossing,  and other   blocking factors, with the goal of identifying classes of these more   complex structures for which optimal design conditions can be   determined with existing methods. Design constructions are being   formulated for each setting as well.   %%%   The general problem of comparing a set of experimental conditions,   or  \"treatments,\" when faced with heterogeneity in the available   units of material on which the experiment is to be performed, is   common to many disparate fields of scientific and industrial inquiry.   The technique of  blocking, one of the early great contributions of    statistics and the experimental process, specifically addresses this   problem. Typically using values of some identifiable nuisance   factor, the experimental units are partitioned into homogeneous   subsets called blocks. Comparison of measurements occurring in   the same block can then be made with greater precision than those   in different blocks, the heterogeneity having  been eliminated from   such compar isons. Thus the experiment  is improved, in the very   practical sense that it gives information  that is more reliable. The   design problem itself,  which is the topic of this study, is to   determine which treatments are assigned to which units in which   blocks, said assignment being driven by the desire to maximize the   overall quality of  information the experiment will ultimately   produce. The problem naturally becomes more complicated as more   nuisance factors, with various relationships among one another, are   introduced or identified. By studying the situation mathematically,   large families of good designs are produced which are then   applicable to a host of experimental situations. Applications run the   gamut of experimental inquiry, from the manufacturing realm to the   agricultural.   ***",
