 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623273  Hilgers        The continued exploration of an improved model for nonlinear  highly elastic membranes is being proposed. The point of departure of  this investigation from  traditional membrane mechanics is the observation that even highly flexible  membranes exhibit some resistance to a change of curvature. This is  known as bending stiffness and is introduced in the improved model by   including a second order derivative dependence in the strain energy  density. The foundational theory has been previously established.  In this proposal, it is sought to apply the theory to a variety of   problems of practical interest with the goal of understanding how bending   stiffness regularizes the behavior of membranes. The basic theme among  these problems is placing a membrane into a state in  which  some region is attempting to support a compressive stress. We anticipate   that the membrane will wrinkle. Standard nonlinear membrane theory fails  to describe this behavior. One objective is to find the qualitative   nature of the wrinkles. Another is to understand how the bending   stiffness stablizes wrinkling deformations. Also the comparison of   results between the zero and nonzero bending stiffness membrane responses  is of extreme interest as it has implications for both mathematics and   mechanics. Specific examples to be considered include inflatables which  are prone to wrinkle, diaphragms, inextensible approximations,  and  vibrations of tense and slack sheets.  %%%        The comfort  technology has given us often requires engineers to  work with thin, flexible sheets, layers, laminates, and coatings of   material. It is problematic for design engineers that these materials will   fold, wrinkle, blister, buckle, and crease during manufacture or operation   thereby reducing their reliability and quality.  Unfortunately, most   mathematical models cannot predict this unwanted behavior,   which makes it difficult for engineers to prevent it. Fortunately, a material   model seeking to  address these shortcomings was developed in  recent years under funding from the National Science Foundation. It is   the purpose of this current proposal to continue this investigation by   using this model to provide examples detailing the formations  of folds and wrinkles in a wide variety of situations leading to a  qualitative and quantitative insight into these engineering   difficulties.  The generality of the model   permits application by  engineers and material   scientists alike to a spectrum of industrial problems ranging from   the blistering of thin coatings to the wrinkling of biomedical   surgical inflatables. Conceivably, the knowledge gained could impact  circuit board manufacture,  air bag safety technology, and even   biomechanical cellular membrane questions which arise in health care.  ***",
