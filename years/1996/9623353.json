Carlini, working with Dr. John E. Graves at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science.  The research project of this student involves obtaining DNA sequence data for two genes, one nuclear and one mitochondrial, in efforts to determine the higher level relationships among cephalopod molluscs in the subclass Coleoidea.  This fascinating group of marine invertebrates includes squid and their relatives.  The group includes many deep sea species that are not readily obtainable.  Thus, the group has been relatively neglected and is in need of systematic study and a robust classification.  This molecular phylogenetic study should provide that classification or hypothesis of relationships, which can then serve as a basis for other interesting research studies involving biogeography, reproductive strategies, morphological adaptations, etc..   This award will provide support for a graduate student pursuing information about relationships of squid and their relatives.  Support for the training of graduate students in modern systematic methodologies is important for maintaining the workforce of scientists capable of addressing the questions and issues of biodiversity which are of increasing global concern.  This group of marine invertebrates, like many others, is in need of systematic study which will provide the background necessary for many other areas of basic research as well as informing applied work such as conservation research and bioprospecting efforts.",
