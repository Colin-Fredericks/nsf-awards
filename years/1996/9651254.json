 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant sciences is often one of the more neglected areas in biology education. Students are usually less familiar with plants than animals and often are not as stimulated by plant research, given plants' static nature and slow growth. This project is designed to develop laboratory exercises for a plant physiology course that can give students some unexpected and interesting insights into plant biology. Once the exercises are implemented and refined in the plant physiology course, some of them can be used in introductory courses to stimulate interest there as well.   The exercises involve video and image capture to analyze patterns of growth and physiological behavior. One approach makes videotape recordings of rapid plant motions, analyzing them in frame-by-frame sequences and quantifying the observations. Similarly, slow plant motions can be analyzed by time-lapse techniques that reveal fascinating patterns of motion not easily visualized by real-time observation. For both techniques, videotape is analyzed with a video micrometer system that allows precise measurements to be made for analysis, or video sequences are digitized into a computer for more complex image analysis and processing. A variety of student group projects can be accommodated during the course of a semester, providing the students with an opportunity to plan an experiment, carry it out, analyze the results, and make a final presentation to the class.",
