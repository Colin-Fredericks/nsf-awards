Insulin plays a major role in modulating circulating glucose levels, and is a part of a feed back loop that maintains both glucose and insulin levels constant in a basal state. In addition, a number of neurotransmitters, as well as metabolic hormones secreted in the gut in response to a meal, can influence glucose metabolism by stimulating secretion of insulin from the pancreas. The failure of insulin producing beta cells to respond to elevated levels of blood glucose leads to the metabolic disorders manifested in patients with Type II diabetes mellitus.  The PI has discovered that a new peptide called glucagon-like peptide I (GLP-I), which is secreted in the gut in response to a meal, is one of the most potent insulin releasing peptides described to date. Results from clinical studies demonstrated that administration of GLP-I together with a meal in patients with Type II diabetes mellitus eliminates the rise in blood glucose in these individuals. On the basis of these findings it has been proposed that GLP-I based therapeutic agent can be used as a new treatment of glucose imbalance observed in patients with Type II diabetes mellitus.  Recently, the receptor for GLP-I has been cloned from the rat and human pancreas. GLP-I receptor is structurally related to a newly identified family of G-protein coupled receptors for several endocrine peptides. At present, there is no understanding about the mechanism of interaction of these G-protein coupled receptors with their respective ligands.  The objective of the proposed research is to determine the structural factors that contribute to the specific interaction of the insulin releasing GLP-I peptide with its receptor. To gain insights into the binding specificity of the mammalian GLP-I receptors, GLP-I receptor will be cloned and sequenced from the whole catfish cDNA library. It is hypothesized that the highest  degree of structural homologies will be found in domains of the receptor that play a role in the specific binding to its GLP-I ligand, receptor interactions with G-proteins and expression of the receptor on the cell surface. To test these predictions, mutant GLP-I receptors will be obtained and their functional properties will be determined in mammalian cell lines that do not exogenously express GLP-I receptor.  Results of these studies will contribute to a better understanding of basic principles in biology. In addition, these results can potentially be useful for commercial development of new generation of \"gut-based\" therapeutic agents for treatment of patients with Type II diabetes mellitus.   ***",
