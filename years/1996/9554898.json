 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to study the feasibility of  creating a pilot program for the certification of  engineering students for teaching in secondary schools. It  is clear that a number of engineering students would  choose  secondary school teaching as a career, if the certification  requirements would not prevent them from doing so. Presently  there appears to be no effective path to place these  talented and dedicated students into the secondary school  classroom.  Given the complexity of the process of secondary  teacher certification, the development of a pilot program  for the nation is challenging. Preliminary indications, as a  result of discussions with the North Carolina Board of  Education, the personnel of the Duke teacher certification  program , and the Duke University Master of Arts in Teaching  program indicate that the development of a model requires  extensive discussions and evaluations.  The project is  undertaking the task of developing a comprehensive and  useful pilot program for encouraging engineering students to  enter secondary education.",
