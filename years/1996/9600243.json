Dr. Szalapski will work with  Dr. Kaoru Hagiwara, Associate Professor in the Theory Group  at KEK, on a research project entitled \"The Observation of  Non-Standard Model Physics at Lepton Colliders.\"    The proposed research will examine a number of theoretical  calculations related to the so-called \"Standard Model\" in  physics, the goal being not only to test the Standard Model,  but also to understand what lies beyond it.  It is believed  that the behavior of all matter in the universe is governed  by four forces.  These forces are electromagnetism, the weak  nuclear force, the strong nuclear force and gravity.  The  quantum theory of electromag-netism, which we call QED, is  well established.  The current theory of the fundamental  forces, an extension of QED, is called the Standard Model.  It unifies electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear  forces in a single theory.  One prediction of the Standard  Model is the existence of additional particles called W and  Z bosons; the discovery and measurement of which have  provided strong evidence for the Standard Model.  However,  some of the most important properties have not yet been  measured.  As it will be possible to make these measurements  in the near future, it is very important to obtain very  precise theoretical calculations to compare with  experimental data.  The proposed research by Dr. Szalapski  will expand upon ongoing collaborative experiments with Dr.  Hagiwara, with the primary intention being to test theories  related to the validity of the Standard Model.  ***",
