 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612281    Sturm   The PI's propose an interdisciplinary program to investigate the critical issues  currently confronting developments in the new and very promising field of  polymer-based organic light emitting devices (OLEDs). Red, green and blue  emitting OLEDs have recently gained worldwide attention due to their  promise for revolutionizing the flat panel display industry. Before these  devices can be used in practical low cost displays, however, many problems  of fundamental as well as of a practical nature must be addressed and  solved. Among the most important issues, which are the subject of the  proposed investigations, are: (i) thickness and compositional control of  the light emitting and charge-transporting thin films; (ii) control and  reduction of impurity incorporation into the films, as well as assessment  of the effects of impurities on OLED performance, (iii) understanding and  control of electron and excitor transport across organic/organic and  organic/metal interfaces, (iv) improvement of device reliability, and (v)  device processing and integration. We have assembled a multidisciplinary  team of researchers from the Departments of Chemistry, Chemical, and  Electrical Engineering at Princeton University and the University of  Southern California with a long term track record of collaboration for  making fundamental advances in the field of OLEDs. We will apply a range of  novel concepts and experimental methods to address all four of these key  issues to the study of polymer/polymer, polymer/small molecule, and  organic/metal interfaces and devices. We anticipate that the impact of this  work will extend well beyond OLED science and technology, into the field of  a wide range of active polymeric and small molecular organic heterojunction  devices such as transistors and solar cells.  ***",
