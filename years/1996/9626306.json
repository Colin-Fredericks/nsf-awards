The methods to be applied here are, first, soliton and   near-integrable systems theory and, second, geometric singularity  theory.The first concerns the modelling of dispersive difference schemes. The  equations of nonlinear optics frequently operate in regimes where  dispersive effects tend to dominate over those of viscosity. A particularly  relevant example of this is the effects of numerical dispersion in modelling   carrier wave shocking of femtosecond pulses. An appropriate model that can  provide a benchmark for these effects is the integrable discrete   nonlinear Schrodinger equations. The integrability of this model enables  one to entertain a precise analysis of continuum limits for this system.  The PI proposes to use the underlying Kahler geometry of this model  to deduce convexity estimates which should enable one to derive a valid  characterization of these limits including the appearance of modulational  instabilities. These characterizations will then be compared to modulation  equations derived by formal averaging as well as to numerical simulations  of non-integrable discretizations of the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) pde.  The second topic concerns pattern formation in nonlinear optics.  Experiments reveal a rich variety of transverse patterns for coherent  fields in a nonlinear optical cavity. The Nonlinear Optics group  of the Arizona Center for Mathematical Sciences has derived  mean field models for a cavity filled with an isotropic,   nonlinear Kerr medium, and driven by a linearly polarised input field.  The equations for this model have the form of a damped, driven coupled   pair of defocussing NLS equations and have  been numerically demonstrated to produce patterns and defects of the  type seen experimentally.  The PI and his collaborators are particularly   interested to understand the formation and evolut ion of defects in   pattern forming evolution equations and have developed order parameter   equations which model the behaviour of modulated roll paterns in a variety  of such evolution equations. The PI proposes to derive and study such  modulation equations for the above mentioned mean field model. The  PI has also developed a general approach, based on geometric singularity  theory,  for the description of singularties in systems of pde's. The   goals of this project will be first, to  classify generic types of  defects for the nonlinear optics model and assess their temporal  stability; second, to control the formation of defects to the end of  either eliminating them or using them to encode information in patterns.  Expectations concerning this second goal are supportied by recent sucess  in controlling pattern irregularities in one dimensional models.   %%%    Nonlinear optics, which may be defined as the study of the interaction  of intense light with matter, was born with the invention of the laser  in the 1960's. In those early days such interactions required very large  intensities; however, nowadays such systems can be constructed with only  modest power requirements.  Along with this has come the possibility of  constructing large, so-called wide aperture, devices such as semiconductor  lasers. Such devices will play an important role in many areas of  technology such as satellite communications systems with an ultrafast switching  capacity. With the introduction of these  larger physical scales   one expects to see the formation of  patterns as well as defects in these patterns (analogous to crystalline  defects) which can be  modelled by the equations developed in this   proposal. Understanding how such patterns arise and evolve can play an  important role in efficiently operating and controlling these devices.  In the second project of this   proposal oscillatory  solutions in a special class of interacting lattice   systems will be investigated.  These systems have modelling app lications   which range from theoretical biology to the numerical methods used in   numerically simulating  optical systems. The goal is to obtain, rigorously,   a continuum description, given by partial differential equations and valid   on long spatial and temporal scales, of the microscopic variations in these  lattice systems. Such models can help to explain how a microscopic system,  such as an alpha-helix protein molecule or a coupled laser array,  can behave collectively, and hence macroscopically, in order to contribute  to phenomena on scales much larger than those orignally present in the  microscopic system.   ***",
