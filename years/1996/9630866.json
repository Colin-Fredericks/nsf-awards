 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630866  Sprugel    Nitrogen  is  one of the most important elements controlling  plant  growth  in both natural and agricultural  ecosystems.  Ecophysiology  theory  suggests  that  the  distribution  of  nitrogen within a plant canopy should match the distribution  of  intercepted light; that is, there should  be  much  more  nitrogen near the top of the canopy (where light levels  are  highest)   than in the more shaded areas near the bottom  of  the canopy.  However, when theoretical predictions have been  compared  with actual plant canopies, the results have  been  mixed  at best. Nitrogen distribution in most canopies  does  show   the same general pattern as that predicted by theory.  However,  the  mechanism by which nitrogen  content  changes  differs  between  species, and the  difference  in  nitrogen  levels from the top to the bottom of the canopy is rarely as  large as the theory predicts that it should be.    The  investigators have developed a hypothesis that explains  this  variation in mechanisms and also suggests some reasons  why  the  variation in nitrogen does not  always  match  the  pattern  of light distribution, especially in older  leaves.  They  propose  to  test this hypothesis in  three  different  western    conifer   species:    Douglas-fir    (Pseudotsuga  menziesii), the most important timber species in the Pacific  Northwest; Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis) an  important  tree  of  high altitude forests; and ponderosa  pine  (Pinus  ponderosa), the dominant tree in dry forests throughout  the  western United States.  If the hypothesis proves correct, it  will  provide  a  better  understanding  of  the  organizing  principles  for shoot structure and function within  complex  canopies,  and  will assist in efforts  to  \"scale  up\"  gas  fluxes  from  leaves  to canopies--a critical  component  of  attempts  to model and predict the consequences  of  climate  change in western conifer forests.",
