 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an investigation of the adaptive and robust design of transmit  signals for wireless transmission paths.  The objective is to determine  fundamental design methods that will allow reliable transmission at data  rates several times faster than are presently achievable by adaptively  contouring the transmit signals to match channel conditions. Time-varying  and/or broadcast wireless transmission paths create special challenges for  such adaptive transmission design that at present have not been solved.  The project first studies transmission on fixed broadcast channels where  feedback to the transmitter is not allowed and principles of robust signal  design need to be derived to improve reliably transmitted data rates.  Study then encompasses time-variation through both well known and new  models for both broadcast and interactive time-varying (mobile) channels.  The focus then shifts to generalization to multiuser coordinated  transmission technologies.  Extension and generalization of multi-tone  waveforms which are very successful on wireline channels will be treated in  these new and more challenging contexts.",
