 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of   Nevada in Reno in the acquisition of a high performance computer   workstation cluster, consisting of six HP 700J and two SGI Indigo 2 XZ   workstations.  This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas   including the following:  (1) Theory of dynamics and spectroscopy, (2) theory of plasma and intense   radiation fields, (3) chemistry of reactive intermediates, (4) theory of   collisional activation, and (5) many body theory of atoms and molecules.  A workstation network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way   to satisfy the computing needs of chemistry departments.  Such a   `computer network` also serves as a developmental environment for new   theoretical codes and algorithms, provides state-of-the-art graphics and   visualization facilities and supports research in state-of-the-art   applications of parallel processing.",
