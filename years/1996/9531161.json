 "awd_abstract_narration": "9531161  Schick  This project is concerned with various aspects of self-  assembling systems, such as block copolymers and lipids.  Microphase separation will be considered in systems of  potential technological importance, such as diblock,  triblock and dendritic copolymers.  There will also be a  study of the ternary mixtures of diblock and homopolymers,  an examination of the swollen lamellar phases and the effect  of fluctuations on them.  The interfacial profiles and their  energy of the interfaces between different microphases will  be calculated.  Finally there will be analysis of the self-  assembly effects in biological membranes during  electroporation and rupture.  %%%  A better understanding  of  self-assembly in polymers is the  objective in this grant. The self-assembly involves phase  separation in a binary and ternary mixtures and the  properties of the interfaces.  There are special phases and  configurations that are studied for their properties.  The  technological applications of the systems studied here are  in the vast range between detergent and drug transport  through the membranes and cells.",
