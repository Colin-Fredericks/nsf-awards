 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Curt Beck and Ms Edith Stout will continue their ongoing program of the analysis of organic materials recovered from European archaeological sites. These include amber as well as tars and pitches which served as glues and sealants in many prehistoric contexts. Organic materials are found in many archaeological sites from different time periods from the Paleolithic through Classical civilizations. The team will pursue three specific goals: 1. The provenience analysis by infrared spectroscopy of archaeological artifacts of amber and related fossil resins with principal emphases on the archaeological amber finds of Switzerland, Portugal and Romania; 2. The determination of the chemical composition and botanical sources of fossil resins by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to separate and identify the molecular constituents of ambers native the European Alps. This will permit distinction between amber artifacts made from local raw materials and those imported from Northern Europe; 3. The analysis and identification of tars and pitches used for the hafting of tools, caulking of ships and lining of transport amphoras.  Archaeologists recognize that to understand prehistoric adaptations they must look beyond individual sites and must determine how these were integrated into intra and inter regional systems. Even before the development of agriculture, interactions appear to have covered hundreds of miles and by 10,000 years ago trade goods moved across Europe. Such systems are reconstructed by matching materials recovered in archaeological sites with their raw material source. Amber, which was highly valued as an ornament was very widely traded and thus is ideal for this purpose. However since this tree resin occurs in many regions it is necessary to pinpoint area of origin and this can be difficult to accomplish. Through the analytic techniques applied by Dr. Beck, in many instances such sourcing can now be done and with this award he and MS Stout will analyze a number of amber and other organic objects.  This research is also important because of its training component. Dr. Beck teaches at an undergraduate institution and for many years has actively involved students in his research. Many of them have been exposed to scientific research through his projects, have published jointly with him and gone on to pursue careers in science.",
