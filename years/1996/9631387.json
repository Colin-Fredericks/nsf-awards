 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award assists in a major collaborative effort to produce an updated, revised, expanded, and electronically-accessible `millennial edition` of the United States Census Bureau's Historical Statistics of the United States.  Historical Statistics of the United States is a massive, two-volume compendium of 54 chapters on topics touching all of the social, behavioral, humanistic, and natural sciences, including history, economics, government, finance, sociology, demography, education, law, natural resources, climate, religion, international migration, and trade.  Over 12,500 statistical time series are presented.  It is the standard source for quantitative indicators of our country's history.  This award supports the revision of Chapter D, Labor.  By the end of the grant period a completed manuscript ready for distribution to the scholarly community and to the general public will be available.  The project also will develop a protocol for the revision of the remaining chapters in Historical Statistics.  Historical Statistics of the United States, now long out of date, is the standard reference for quantitative information on American history for scholars, authors, reference librarians, journalists, and the general public.  It also serves as a guide to more detailed data, to commentary on data reliability, and to historical scholarship on virtually every topic in American history.  It is found in every academic, corporate, and public library in the country and in many libraries around the world.  The new edition will thoroughly revise and update the previous edition and has the potential of having a major impact not only on historical scholarship but on academic research in the social, physical, and biological sciences.  It will also serve to reacquaint the general public with the long record of American economic, social, and demographic diversity, change, and development.",
