 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626307  Brady    A central issue in soft materials is the prediction of their  behavior  during  processing, especially  the  evolution  of  their structure during flow and/or chemical reaction.   With  the  increasing activity in this area of materials research,  there is a concomitant  increase  in  the   need for  instrumentation to  characterize the flow behavior of  polymeric and colloidal materials.    Research at the California Institute of Technology probes  a  wide range of complex fluids:  new biomedical materials,  mesostructured polymers, colloidal suspensions and polymer  solution-precursors of phase-inversion  membranes.  Development of materials for in-situ synthesis of biomedical  polymers demands measurement of rapid changes in the  viscoelasticity of reacting systems.  Establishing efficient  methods to control order in mesostructured polymers requires  simultaneous optical and mechanical characterization of  their flow behavior.  Testing current understanding of  colloidal suspensions depends upon precise measurements of  both the first and second normal stress differences, in  addition to the shear stress.  It is necessary to examine  the dynamics of all these systems under flow conditions that  include inception of shearing at a fixed rate, creep under  fixed shear stress, dynamic shearing, and superposed steady  and dynamic shear.  %%%  This grant provides funds for the purchase of two  rheometers:  one for experiments under controlled shear  strain and the other optimized for controlled stress and  strain experiments.  ***",
