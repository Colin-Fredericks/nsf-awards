 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  Proposal: DMS-9622844  PI: Heinonen    The proposal has three parts. Part I is the most significant. In Part I, Heinonen outlines a program of study of quasiconformal maps in metric spaces with little smoothness.  The goal of the project, joint with   Pekka Koskela, is to systematically develop a theory of quasiconformal maps on metric spaces that possess certain quantitative bounds on their mass and geometry. The motivation to  develop such a theory comes  partly from geometry and combinatorial group theory, where it is important to understand quasiconformal maps on boundaries of negatively curved spaces. Heinonen and Koskela have discovered that the validity of a  Poincare type inequality in a space is practically tantamount to the validity of a working quasiconformal theory. In Part II, Heinonen proposes  problems on the lower dimensional absolute  continuity properties of quasiconformal maps in Euclidean space. He has established that a quasiconformal map, defined on the unit ball of Euclidean space of any dimension larger than two, but not equal to four, has absolutely continuous boundary values if the boundary of the image domain has tangents almost everywhere with respect to the surface measure. The sharpness of this result is discussed, as well as the redundancy of the dimensional restriction. In Part III, Heinonen proposes problems, jointly with Seppo Rickman, related to the  structure of the branch set of a quasiregular map. Heinonen suggests a way to construct quasiregular maps with complicated branch set.     The proposal presents a shift from analysis to geometry via discrete methods in the theory of quasiconformal mappings. Here the word \"analysis\" means  the branch of mathematics that developed out of the Calculus; it is the study of continuous changes in infinitesimal data, from which  one wants to predict global conclusions. Geometry, perhaps the most fundamental part of all mathematics, is the study of space, its many forms and varieties, in many possible dimensions.  Discrete methods mean the opposite to continuous, or calculus methods, and involve more finite, \"counting\" ideas, such as those done by a computer, albeit in this work still of analytic and geometric flavor. The concept of quasiconformality enters the discussion in the most subtle way: it allows the space and its formation to be singular at times and in places, but not everywhere and not all the time. There is a certain control in the distortion, which perhaps looked  artificial to mathematicians 40 years ago when the research first in the field was conducted. Now quasiconformality is a ubiquitous phenomenon in mathematics. From work in the late  seventies we know that every space that locally looks like a flat space of Euclid has quasiconformal structure, albeit not a smooth structure in general; and that this is true in every dimension but four. Nevertheless, also in dimension four, it is conjectured that there is an infinity of spaces where one cannot do ordinary, smooth analysis, or calculus, but where one can do quasiconformal, nonsmooth analysis. The proposal addresses the need to develop more techniques, and more understanding, of this new calculus.",
