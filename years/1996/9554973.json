 "awd_abstract_narration": "A project-based course in environmental field methods will be  develmped for students in the second year of earth science  programs, creating a new context for students' first encounter  with more complex, and in particular, more quantitative science  topics. By teaching geophysical and geochemical field methods  through a sequence of in-depth studies of current environmental  problems, presented in their historical and social context, we  hope to keep students, especially women and minorities, in the  quantitative science pipeline and make clear their own potential  for such work. Students will work through in-depth environmental  \"case-studies\", or project modules, on topics such as salt water  intrusion in coastal Florida, uranium mining remediation in the  Navajo Nation, and eutrophication in a Georgia estuary. Students  will process a subset of the data, combine data sets, analyze  and interpret the data, define limits to their interpretations,  and make and justify policy decisions. The course will be built  around six or seven sequential modules, with each module  designed to follow a classroom introduction to the relevant  field methods. We plan to add supporting materials to these  modules so that they can also be used as individual case studies  in environmental geology, hydrology, geophysics, and  geochemistry courses, and will be in a form that can be  disseminated on the WWW, CD-rom, and hardcopy.    This work will be a collaborative effort by four faculty at  disparate institutions (College of William and Mary, Navajo  Community College, and Georgia Tech). Each of us will design one  or two modules, working with undergraduates at our home  institutions. We will collaboratively review and revise each  module as we develop the course as a whole. Thus students will  encounter a wider range of both geographic settings and cultural  contexts for environmental problems than is currently found in  quantitative geo-science courses.",
