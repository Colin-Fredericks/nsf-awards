It includes an analysis of the ways in which different types of spending (instruction, administrative, etc.) influence the academic achievement such as effective school organization.  The study would use a number of multivariate techniques such as structural equation models to analyze nationally representative linked data bases from the Common core of Data and the National Assessment for Education Progress. These two data bases combine the financial information of school districts with student assessment data of districts.",
