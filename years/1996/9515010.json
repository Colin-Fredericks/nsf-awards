 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the newest developments in American business is the use of  employee involvement (EI) programs-- by which we mean a diverse  set of personnel and management practices such as self-directed  work teams, total quality management, or quality circles, and the  like that give workers more authority at workplaces.  Existing  studies of EI have not addressed whether these practices enhance  organizational performance save in particular sectors, whether  any performance gain is do to organizational change or human  capital enhancement, or the benefits that flow to workers from  EI. They have raised questions as to whether unions increase the  effectiveness of EI programs, why some establishments have EI and  others do not, and most critically, about the set of new  practices that firms must adopt for EI programs to succeed, and  what those practices might be.    To address these questions a series of 20 case investigations of  establishments, including some paired comparisons of  establishments with EI programs and those without, and of  establishments where these programs have failed will be  undertaken.  In addition, a new data on employee involvement  programs in several hundred establishments will be developed;  examine the relationship between EI programs and productivity  using longitudinal data from the LRD Survey of Manufacturers  files of the Census.  Finally, employee outcomes using the  Workplace Representation and Participation Survey will examined.  The study will provide valuable information to business, labor,  and government on the importance of employee participation in the  creation and maintenance of high performance workplaces.",
