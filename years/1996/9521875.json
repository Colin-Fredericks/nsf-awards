 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521875  Hellawell    This two-year renewal provides for completion of research on  the  development  of equiaxed grains in metal castings.   The  initial  source  for  the grain solidification is thought to  be  dendrite  fragments  that  have become detached within  the  earlier  mushy  region  of the casting.  The fragments are transported  out  into  the   bulk   liquid  by  thermo-solutal  convection.    Surviving  fragments grow, sink, and eventually block columnar grains.   The  steps  in  modeling the process have been identified and analyzed  in  some  detail,  and it is recognized that the conditions  that  promote  dendrite  arm detachment are associated  with  transient  growth  conditions.  These conditions mirror those in a  casting,  where   columnar   dendritic   growth   front   is   decelerating  continuously   and   the   temperature   gradient   is    falling  simultaneously.   This critical step in the process  is  examined  analytically  and experimentally using transparent analogues  and  selected metal alloys.  %%%  This topic addresses a major gap in understanding the development  of  the  microstructure of alloy castings.  This complex  process  should  be  clarified  by the experimental and  theoretical  work  proposed.  ***",
