One of the research groups  emphasizes fundamental materials issues in ferroelectric thin  film heterostructures , related device problems of technological  relevance, and fundamental materials physics of perovskite  materials that exhibit unusually large (\"colossal\") magneto-  resistance.  The second group investigates the structure of  surfaces on length scales from nanometers to microns, with the  goal of developing a predictive understanding of surface  morphology.  The work may ultimately find practical application  in micro-electronics, thin film growth, lubrication, catalysis,  and other areas.  A common theme for both groups is the  development, optimization and utilization of novel surface  sensitive tools to measure structural, magnetic, and electrical  properties at microscopic length scales.  The MRSEC supports the  development, operation and maintenance of shared experimental  facilities for materials research.  It provides seed funding for  exploratory research and fosters research participation by  undergraduates.  The Center is associated with an educational  outreach program designed to enlighten pre-college and  undergraduate students about science and the role of the center's  research program in the modern world.  The MRSEC also supports  enhanced collaboration with industry, shared experimental  facilities that also support research not directly funded by the  MRSEC, and seed funding for exploratory  research.  The Center  currently supports about 15 senior investigators, 7 postdoctoral  research associates, 1 technician or other professional, 12  graduate students, and 8 undergraduates.  The MRSEC is directed  by Professor Ellen D. Williams.  %%%  The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at  the University of  Maryland supports interactive research in two  interdisciplinary groups focusing on oxides, thin films, and  novel surface spectroscopic probes.
