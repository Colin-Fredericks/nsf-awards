 "awd_abstract_narration": "An amazing proportion of Americans from all walks of life  believe in what scientists call \"pseudo-science.\"  Very few  newspapers, for example, do not carry an astrology column.  Timing of significant events in certain Asian countries are  determined by astrologers.  Even a recent first lady  consulted an astrologer in order to find the most propitious  timing for state events.    While scorned  by many scientists, there is a long tradition  of interaction among the \"pseudo-sciences\" and the \"real\"  sciences.  Johannes Kepler and Tycho Brahe both practiced  astrology.  Robert Boyle and Isaac Newton both practiced  alchemy.  The research that Drs. Principe and Newman are  undertaking examines the relationship between what we now  call pseudo-science and the development of \"true\" science  during the scientific revolution.   In particular, they are  examining the influence of alchemical traditions as  practiced in America on the rise of modern chemistry.  They  are examining the laboratory notebooks of  George Starkey, a  graduate of Harvard,  who undertook  experimental testing of  alchemical theories.  His emphasis on control and  quantification became a hallmark of modern chemistry.    This research is not aimed to undermine the standards of  contemporary science.  Rather, its aim is to show how  scientific method growing out of pseudosciences can lead to  legitimate scientific results if properly pursued.  One  might wish that current practitioners of astrology would  apply the same methods of control and quantification pursued  by Starkey and his colleagues.  In the long run, the true  efficacy of such belief in extra-terrestrial influences on  human lives could then be discerned.",
