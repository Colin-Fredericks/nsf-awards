 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632660  Gelenbe       After a forty to fifty year cycle, the dramatic evolution of  this technology is enabling a return to the fundamental  biological paradigms which inspired the early intellectual of  information technology such as John von Neumann, Stephen Kleene  and Marvin Minsky.  As an example, artificial neural networks  resulted from the early models of McCulloch and Pitts concerning  biological neurons.  Their mathematical theory was developed by  engineers, mathematicians and physicists, and a very broad  variety of significant applications have resulted from this work.   Now psychologists have adopted them as mechanistic models of  human and animal thought processes, and are contributing to the  theory of how these models simulate and elucidate learning.   Similarly, concepts from genetics are modifying the manner in  which computer algorithms are being developed, while algorithmic  and information theoretic concepts (and neural networks) have  become tools for research in genetics.       The purpose of this workshop is to broaden and pursue this  long-term and fruitful interaction of Engineering with the Life  and Human Sciences, by investigation the processes which provide  Systems, both Artificial and Natural, with Autonomous and  Adaptive Behavior.  The workshop will call upon prominent  researchers who study examples of autonomous behavior such as the  food chain, food ingestion, and animal psychology.  The workshop  will also call upon researchers who take a Systems Engineering or  Mathematical/Physical science approach to artificial autonomous  behavior such as self-organizing hardware, genetic algorithms,  neural networks, approximate reasoning and robotics.  The  encounter between these two lines of thought in the presence of  high-quality and energetic audience - as well as a number of  industrially relevant \"real\" problems areas-will lead to a better  understanding of the state of the art, to new modeling efforts,  and to the exchange of paradigms between these two impor tant  areas.  Participation of young faculty members and post-docs, as  well as women and minorities will be emphasized.    ***",
