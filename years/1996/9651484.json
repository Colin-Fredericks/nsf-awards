 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a growing consensus that student learning in the sciences is enhanced by a research-like laboratory experience. However, the number of students who can actually participate in faculty-student research is generally limited by both faculty time and resources. An alternative to this is to provide research-like experiences during course laboratories by allowing students to carry out experiments in which the outcome is unknown.   Courses in environmental analysis, which often are interesting to students, are offering students an opportunity to participate in these experiments. This project incorporates the use of ion chromatography and field analyses into two courses_Analytical Chemistry and Environmental Analysis. The Analytical Chemistry course is introducing two new experiments involving multiple analytical techniques (including ion chromatography). These experiments focus on the drinking water treatment process. Environmental Analysis, a new course focusing on the interplay of chemical and biological factors in ecosystems, provides a strong field and laboratory component. The course is being team-taught by an ecologist and an analytical chemist. It involves extensive use of an ion chromatograph to study both freshwater and soil processes. Multiple field pH and dissolved oxygen meters enable the class to work in small groups simultaneously, measuring chemical parameters in the field. Use of these instruments results in increased student interest.",
