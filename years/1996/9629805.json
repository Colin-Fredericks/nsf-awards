 "awd_abstract_narration": "9629805  Mohan  Power Quality has lately become a major concern to the electric  utility industry due to increasing number of nonlinear loads,  simultaneously with loads which are sensitive to voltage waveform  distortions, sags and swells, and the electro-magnetic  interference (EMI).  There are numerous examples of momentary  voltage dips resulting in tripping of motor drives, nonlinear  loads causing lamp flicker, and so on.  Many of these problems  can be eliminated by fast acting static var compensators and  active filters.  But their cost and a lack of adequate  performance have limited their application.  The objective of the proposed research is to develop a novel all-  active hybrid converter arrangement for solving Power Quality  problems, initially for medium distribution voltages such as 4.16  kV and 7.2 kV, which excels in the areas of efficiency, cost,  performance and EMI (Electro-Magnetic Interference), without  sacrificing reliability.  ***",
