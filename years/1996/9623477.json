The hallmark of the work is the extension of the parameter  space  to  very low temperatures and very high magnetic  fields.   The  focus  of work on the superconductor-insulator transition will  be  on  resolving whether the transition is governed by a variant of the Boson-  Hubbard  model or, is a consequence of decreased screening by disorder  of  the repulsive electron-electron interaction.   The work on quantum  tunneling  of vortices should reveal new features of the  dynamics  of  vortices,  in  particular the extent to which their  behavior  can  be  fundamentally quantum mechanical. The other investigations of  quantum  properties  of  vortices, including studies of quantum vortex  lattice  melting,  superconducting  analogs of the  quantum  Hall  effect,  and  vortex  shot  noise will contribute to a coherent picture of  electron  transport and superconductivity in two dimensions.  %%%  The   study  of  two  dimensional  superconductors  impacts  important  paradigms  in  contemporary  Condensed Matter  Physics  including  the  superconductor-insulator  transition, and  the  quantum  tunneling  of  vortices, an important dynamical property of Abrikosov vortices.   The  investigation of model problems and model  systems  in  two dimensions, in addition to their intrinsic scientific  interest, will contribute to our knowledge of the mechanism of high-Tc  superconductivity, and to our understanding of vortex  dynamics.   The  dynamics  of  vortices,  which  exist in superconductors  in  magnetic  fields, are of interest because vortex motion causes dissipation.  The  promise of superconductivity to bring about changes in electrical  and  electronic  technology   is connect ed with reduced  dissipation.   The  understanding  of  the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity  will  aid  in the search for new materials. The understanding  of  the  fundamental  limits on performance  resulting from vortex motion  will  contribute  to  our  understanding of factors which  could  limit  the  technological usefulness of superconductors.  ***",
