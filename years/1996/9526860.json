 "awd_abstract_narration": "9526860  Raffensperger    Processes occurring in sedimentary basins include basin-scale groundwater flow, heat transport, and reactive mass transport.  Quantitative models of flow and transport in these settings can provide insight into the coupled processes that control their hydrological and geochemical evolution.  The Cigar Lake uranium deposit provides and excellent opportunity to study the coupled processes of groundwater flow and mass transport/transfer.  It is representative of unconformity-type uranium deposits found in Canada and Australia, which are characterized by: location near an unconformity between weathered metasedimentary basement rocks and overlying thick sandstone sequences, their age of formation (1300-1600 Ma), an association with faulted basement structures and graphite-rich basement rocks, and intensive hydrothermal alteration halos.  Cigar Lake has been studied as an analog for high-level nuclear waste repositories, and has experienced relatively little post-formation alteration.  Data are now available on the mineralogy and petrology, as well as the hydrological properties, of the rocks in the region.  Raffensperger (1993) developed a unique finite element approach to quantifying two-dimensional groundwater flow, heat transport, and reactive multicomponent mass transport in heterogeneous geologic settings, which was used to examine the formation of these deposits.  However, this effort did not fully explain certain features of the deposits, for which additional work is required.  This study will examine the formation of the Cigar Lake uranium deposit and associated alteration, and will focus on the following topics: (1) conditions required for mineralization within basement rocks; (2) consideration of the role of feedback coupling, in which porosity and permeability modifications due to mineral precipitation and dissolution are incorporated into the groundwater flow calculations; and (3) the creation of a general research tool for the quantitative study of coupled hydro logical and geochemcial processes.    The apparent stability of the Cigar Lake deposit has been attributed to the low-permeability clay alteration halo surrounding it.  How this alteration developed and influenced the ore-forming process is a significant question which can be addressed through coupled modeling.  Coupling of important hydrological and geochemical processes, within a flexible numerical framework, will permit accurate integration of geological, hydrological, and geochemical data.  Furthermore, coupling will be significant in that the interdependence of hydrologic and geochemical processes may be evaluated.  Detailed simulations of an individual deposit will help refine the general picture presented by previous studies, and help answer remaining questions.  Unconformity-type uranium deposits are being studies as analogs for nuclear waste repositories.  How these deposits formed, and why they have remained relatively intact over a time period of 1.3 billion years constitute geologically and environmentally important research questions.  The educational plan consists of the following elements: (1) Development of an interactive, mullet-media textbook for EVSC 340 Physical Hydrology, a core course required for all majors; (2) Inclusion of undergraduate students in the proposed research through independent study and summer research opportunities; and (3) The creation of a new course, to be titled \"Water on Earth\".  Work on the first element will begin this fall, with the support of a University ITC fellowship and release time provided  by the PI's Dean.  The third element will be developed through 1995 and 1996, to be taught for the first time during the 1996-1997 academic year.  The goal of the new course  will be to provide a \"service course\" in hydrology to the University, and to build a bridge between our understanding of hydrological science and the role that  understanding plays in a variety of contemporary and historical issues.",
