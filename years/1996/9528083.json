 "awd_abstract_narration": "9528083  Spencer  This project conducts research on development of high-tech  devices for the safety and life extension of civil  infrastructure systems.  Passive and active retrofit  strategies represent the two ends of the spectrum in the use  of control for reducing the response of civil infrastructure  system subjected to dynamic hazard such as earthquakes.  Semiactive and hybrid control devices potentially combine  the best features of both the passive and active approaches  for mitigating undesirable response.  An interdisciplinary  investigation of a new semi-active control device that uses  a magnetorheological (MR) fluid in a controllable fluid  damper is carried out.  The MR damper overcomes many of the  cost and technical difficulties of current semi-active  control devices, and has high potential for use in civil  infrastructure systems.  In addition to its great promise  for retrofits, the MR dampers are also attractive for new  construction.  The research will involve: (1) testing of the  MR damper to characterize its behavior and to identify  control-oriented models, (2) development of device specific  nonlinear control algorithms that can take maximum advantage  of the unique features of the MR damper, (3) conducting  proof of concept tests for several structural system  configurations in the Structural Dynamics and  Control/Earthquake engineering Laboratory (SDC/EEL) at the  University of Notre Dame, and conducting larger scale  implementation and verification tests at the National Center  for Earthquake Engineering Research (NCEER) in Buffalo, New  York.  Successful completion of this research is expected to  accelerate economic and practical implementations of  innovative retrofit strategies for dynamics hazard  mitigation in civil infrastructure systems.  ***",
