Ireton  Instititution:  American Geophysical Union  Title:  Spheres of Influence:  Shaping the Future of Earth  Systems Sciences Education    ABSTRACT:    The American Geophysical Union will convene a  workshop  called, \"Spheres of Influence: Shaping the Future of Earth  System Sciences Education\".  This project is an outgrowth of  the 1994 Chapman Conference sponsored by the American  Geophysical Union on  \"Scrutiny of Geoscience Education\".  The former workshop was an exploration of common issues and  problems;  this workshop is a call to action.    This is a  timely project because of the recent attention focused on  the earth sciences due to questions of environmental  degradation, natural hazard reduction, and thematic topics  such as global change. National studies such as Geosciences  and Society (NRC), National Science Education Standards  (NRC), Project 2061 and Benchmarks for Science Literacy  (AAAS) also call attention to the need for improved  education in the geosciences.    A steering committee, composed of  participants from  geology, atmospheric sciences, and oceanography,  will meet  to refine the agenda for the meeting, and to  identify  qualified participants.  The central themes that will be  addressed at the workshop include:  earth sciences for all  students, curricular issues, training of future teachers  (and implementation of K-12 science standards),  use of new  technologies in the classroom, integration research and  education,  recruitment and retention of diverse  populations in the earth sciences, changing the culture of  instruction in the earth sciences, and  collaborations and  other partnerships.  Participants will be selected  to  provide the broadest representation  based on sub-  discipline, type of home institution, geographic  distribution,  professional experience, race, and gender.    This will be a writing workshop, with participants selected  to write recommendations and action plans for topics  identified above. Participants will be assig ned to a given  topic, will engage in  an electronic exchange of ideas  prior to coming to the workshop, and will come prepared to  write their recommendations.  The outcome of this workshop  will be a document similar to NSF 94-19 \"Innovation and  Change in the Chemistry Curriculum\".  This document will be  published by AGU; it will be broadly disseminated to earth  science departments across the country, and will be  accessible through the AGU homepage.  A special session at  the  AGU annual meeting will be dedicated to the  presentation of the results of the workshop, and  summaries  of each of the working groups will also be published in EOS.    The outcome of this workshop will be a document in which the  common  themes of earth science education will be  articulated, common goals for students and faculty will be  defined, and  specific recommendations will be made about  how  faculty, departments, and the earth science community  in general  can reach these goals.  This is an important  step towards developing a stronger presence of the earth  sciences in the overall educational mission of the National  Science Foundation.",
