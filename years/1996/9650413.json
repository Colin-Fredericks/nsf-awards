 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is two-fold:  (1) to develop software that may be implemented in a variety of computing environments to visualize algorithms and then (2) to incorporate the use of that software into laboratory exercises in courses throughout the computer science curriculum. The former goal was achieved largely during the summer of 1988, with refinements to the system occurring in the summer of 1989. Working with students Pamela J. Krussel and Christopher D. Hundhausen, project principal investigator Dr. Thomas L. Naps developed the GAIGS (Generalized Algorithm Illustration through Graphical Software) algorithm visualization system. This software runs on the local area VAX cluster which is the hub of the computer science laboratory. The software presents graphical animations of algorithms on VAXStation 2000s. The animation is generated by a program that implements that algorithm on any of the computer systems on campus.",
