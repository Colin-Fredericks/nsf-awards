 "awd_abstract_narration": "New firm creation is a vital element of technological innovation,  job creation, and economic growth.  While research has shown that  new firms have grown to dominate industries like biotechnology,  computers, communications, and many others, relatively little is  known about how these firms are financed in their earliest  stages.  The optimal source of financing is likely to vary  depending upon the industry, the firm's stage of development, and  the time period observed.  The purpose of this project is to  collect data from 1553 firms that issued equity in an initial  public offering (IPO) between January 1, 1978 and December 31,  1987.  Registration documents filed with the SEC contain  information on the sources of financing, pre-IPO performance, and  pre-IPO investment patterns for companies that are planning to go  public in the near future.  Creating a database with this  information would be indispensable for future research on factors  affecting new firm financing and growth.    The collection of a large database on the financing history and  pre-public operating performance of private firms will create  numerous research opportunities.  Some of these topics include:  How do industry and firm specific characteristics interact to  determine the optimal source of capital?  How does firm  performance affect who gives firms their financing to grow?  How  do the sources of financing affect the speed at which the firm  can grow?  Have there been secular changes in the sources of  financing over the time period?  Does the presence of a  professional investor, such as a venture capitalist, improve the  pre-public performance of a company compared to a firm that has  not received venture capital financing?  These are only a few of  the questions that the data can address.",
