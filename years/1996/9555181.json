 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  goal  of  this   project  is to  develop  a  curriculum  for  engineering  students  and  liberal  arts  majors  on  laboratory  experimentation.   The   curriculum   spans   two   courses:   an  introductory  class  geared  for liberal  arts  students  (mainly  pre-service teachers engaged in teacher preparation programs) and  first-year  engineers,  and  a required  junior-level  mechanical  engineering   course.  In  the  introductory   course,   students  concentrate on simple experimentation techniques, learning how to  interface  a  computer  to an experiment and  how  to  do  simple  statistical  analysis of the data. Students  in  the  upper-level  course learn the electronics behind the data acquisition systems,  learn  more  in-depth signal processing, and  work  on  oral  and  written skills.    The  curriculum is based on the LDAPS, or LegoTM Data Acquisition  and   Prototyping  System,  which  is  a  pedagogical   technique  originally developed  for K-6 science education. The LDAP  System  uses LegoTM building blocks and a LabVIEWTM computer interface to  provide the tools for students to design, build, instrument,  and  execute their own experiments. The LegoTM blocks give the student  the  freedom  in designing the experimental setup  and  LabVIEWTM  gives   the  signal  processing  freedom  needed  to  effectively  interrogate  the  data.  For example, students  learned  advanced  digital  filtering  techniques by building  a  LegoTM  gray-scale  scanner and active control through building a car which tries  to  drive   around   obstacles.   This  pedagogical   technique   was  successfully implemented in a pilot study, with excellent student  reviews.",
