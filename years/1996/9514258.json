This special symposium is being held in honor of Dr.Vincent  Massey, a leader in the field of biological oxidations, on  his 70th birthday.  The symposium will focus on enzyme-  catalyzed oxidations and flavins and flavoproteins.  The  speakers will include 10 from the United States and 6 from  foreign countries.  All have made significant research  contributions in the field of biological oxidation's and  many are Dr. Maser's former students and collaborators.  Topics that will be discussed include:  oxygenases,  hydroxylases, oxidases, and dehydrogenases in addition to  broader topics such as protein flexibility and biological  development of the oxidative proteins.  %%%  Biological oxidation includes virtually all of the  biochemical processes by which energy is derived from foods.  A large range of enzymes accomplish the various reactions  that are involved.  This meeting will bring together  investigators who are working on the broad range of enzymes  and related topics that are linked by a common theme, i.e.,  biological oxidation.  It is expected that information  exchange among these investigators will lead to new insight  into this field.  ***",
