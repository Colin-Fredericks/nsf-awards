This is an important aspect of classical knot  theory and has potential applications to the Poincare conjecture.  A  second goal is to improve the known bounds for the distance between  various types of exceptional Dehn fillings of a 3-manifold with torus  boundary.  This amounts to achieving a quantitative understanding of  the phenomenon that a generic Dehn surgery on a hyperbolic knot  produces a hyperbolic manifold.  A third objective is to improve some  of the known lower bounds for volumes of hyperbolic manifolds under  various topological restrictions.  Such bounds give a quantitative  understanding of the Mostow Rigidity Theorem, which implies that the  volume of a hyperbolic manifold is a topological invariant.       Topology is the branch of mathematics that deals with properties of  geometric objects that are so universal that they are unaffected by  any distortion of the shape of the object.  A simple example of such a  property is the winding number of a closed circuit in the plane.  If  the circuit does not pass through the origin, then it winds around the  origin a certain number of times, and that number is not affected by  any distortion of the circuit (just so long as it never passes through the  origin during its deformation).  This was the main idea in Gauss's  first proof that every polynomial equation has a solution in the  complex numbers and was the origin of the subject of topology.  The  geometric objects being studied by Culler and Shalen are 3-dimensional  spaces, one example of which is our physical universe.  (The  geometric and topological properties of the physical universe are  not yet understood, but modern physics has shown that it is definitely  not the 3-dimensional Euclidean space that we study in high school.)  This research focuses on various numerical quantities that are   determined by the geometric properties of the space.  The goal is to  understand how the fundamental topological properties of the space are  reflected in these quantities.  In very general terms, this is  analogous to the process by which the chemical composition of a star  can be deduced by studying its spectrogram.  ***",
