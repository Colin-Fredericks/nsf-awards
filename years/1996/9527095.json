 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dilip Kondepudi is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to perform experimental and theoretical   studies of auto catalytic and stochastic kinetics of crystallization.  He   plans to study the fundamental aspects of spontaneous generation,   propagation and amplification of chiral asymmetry.  Kondepudi has   discovered that stirred solutions of sodium chlorite crystallize with   nearly 100% either dextro- or levorotatory crystals.  His research   program has been directed at attempting to model and explain this   phenomenon of spontaneous generation of chiral symmetry.  He has shown   that the amplification arises as a non-linear process caused by secondary   nucleation after the breakup of a small crystallite in the stirring   process.  He plans to extend the experiments in new directions,   particularly with regard to primary and secondary nucleation studies of   amino acids.  It is well known that for many drug compounds only one enantiomer is   biologically active, and in some well known cases the other enantiomer   may have deleterious side effects including genetic damage.    Understanding of physical and chemical processes that generate chiral   asymmetry may be of great practical value in improving methods to produce   enantiomerically pure compounds.",
