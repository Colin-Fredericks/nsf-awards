 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project centers around the purchase of a 24-channel seismic unit, vertical and horizontal geophones, geophone cable, and seismic refraction interpretation software (generalized reciprocal method). These items make possible the introduction of a geophysical component into hydrogeology instruction for aquifer characterization and basin analysis and the introduction of an environmental/hydrogeological component into geophysics instruction. A large project, in which both types of undergraduate student participate, allows all parties to obtain hands-on experience in the design of experiments, data collection, reduction, and interpretation. The use of joint field trips between classes and joint work sessions allow each student to see the scope of the project. The first project, representative of what could be accomplished, is being performed at Pine Mountain Club, a rural resort community in the semi-arid mountainous region north of Los Angeles. The community lies in the trace of the San Andreas fault and produces its scanty water supply from fault gouge. The project not only focuses on standard exploration techniques for additional water supplies, but also on characterization of the aquifer and its enclosing schistose bedrock. Peripheral projects include landslide investigations.   Seismic reflection, refraction, and shear wave studies are being undertaken in conjunction with already-available gravity, magnetic, and ground penetrating radar studies and conventional hydrogeological investigations (aquifer testing and water chemistry).",
