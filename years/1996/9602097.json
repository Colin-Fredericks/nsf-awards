 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, a summer `pilot` workshop for professors and graduate students in various fields of science and engineering,  seeks to help science and engineering teachers at universities and colleges in the Rocky Mountain region develop strategies for teaching research ethics to undergraduate and graduate students.  The workshop, led by people actively teaching ethics in science, will allow participants to learn more about ethical issues in research and to develop ways of incorporating ethics into the science curriculum through designing new courses, modifying existing courses, and by mainstreaming ethics into various aspects of formal instruction and informal training. To assess the effectiveness of the workshop after participants return to their home institutions, an electronic network (listserver) will be set up for participants and workshop leaders.  This will allow participants to report back on what they have learned in the workshop, how it can be improved, and what plans they have developed to implement strategies learned.",
