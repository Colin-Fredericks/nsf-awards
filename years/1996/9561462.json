 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop thermosetting anti-reflective coatings (ARCs) that are optimum for 193 nm optical lithography applications.  This is the most likely exposure wavelength for the generation of equipment that follows deep-UV (248 nm).  Since reflectivity coefficients at this shorter wavelength are similar or (in some instances) higher than those at 248 nm, a need for an ARC undeneath the 193 nm resist can be expected.  The research objective of is to provide at least one outstanding or optimum 193-nm ARC for manufacturers to use during resist development and for the production of semiconductor devices.       Light absorbing chromaphore (193 nm) will be chemically-attached to three different polymer hosts.  The host polymers have been selected for high aliphatic content and the expectation that they will exhibit improved oxygen-plasma etch rates.  To assure insolubility in photoresist solvents, the dye-attached polymers will be formulated into thermosetting systems (ARCs).  The profile of 193 nm resist poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) at optimum exposure and dose will be used to optimize ARC chemistry.  Plasma etch rates of the cured 193 nm ARCs will be compared to ARC CD11.  ARC stability and manufacturability will be determined.       ARCs developed in Phase I would be further improved in Phase II and characterized with an amplified resist.  A successful product will be useful to integrated circuit makers, offering promise for increased packing density on semiconductor substrates.",
