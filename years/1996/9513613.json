 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9513613  Anomalous kinetics for the coupled reactions of dehydrogenases (DeHs) of opposite chiral specificity have been well documented since 1940. The only simple explanation of the anomalies is that the complex of donor enzyme with NADH (El NADH) can directly transfer NADH to an acceptor enzyme E2 so that NADH doesn't significantly equilibrate with the bulk aqueous phase. That is:  NADH is a competent substrate for E2. The potential metabolic consequences of this \"channeling\" are far greater than commonly realized. For example, 1) channeling permits enzyme reactions to proceed independently of bulk phase substrate concentrations, 2) channeling isolates metabolites from competing reactions, 3) enzyme bound substrates avoid the inadequate solvation capacity of the cell, 4) the desolvated state of substrates bound to enzymes may be a major factor in enzyme rate enhancement, 5) channeling permits larger degree of control by the enzymes according to recently extended metabolic control theory, and 6) channeling systems are subject to regulation by modulators that affect enzyme associations. Most of these consequences result from the microcompartmentation of metabolites that is inherent in this mechanism. A puzzling aspect of NADH channeling among the DeHs, however, was the difficulty in observing the El NADH E2 complex in vitro. Peticolas et al. appear to have resolved this problem by demonstrating that association of the two enzymes depends critically on the NADH concentration. Their experiments were limited to the a-glycerol-P (aGPD) & lactate (LDH) DeH enzyme pair (plus a negative control with two A chiral specific DeHs), two NADH concentrations, and a single experimental method. Because of the potential significance of this process in metabolism, we propose the following overlapping objectives. 1) Characterize the NADH modulation of the association of dehydrogenases to: a) more definitively establish the properties of the LDH-aGPD system, and b) test the generality of this NADH modulat ion among other enzyme pairs. 2) Correlate these enzyme associations with the efficiencies of substrate channeling among different enzyme pairs, and 3) Correlate these association and channeling properties with the molecular structures of the donor and acceptor enzymes. Enzyme associations will be studied by fluorescence polarization, agarose gel electrophoresis, Hummel-Dreyer size exclusion chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation, and differential thermal titration methods. In addition, the possibility that the association of E1 with E2 occurs only during the steady-state of the E2 catalyzed reaction will be tested by computer simulations. NADH channeling will be characterized by the \"enzyme buffering method\" and metabolic control theory and experiments. These functional properties will be correlated with enzyme structures using molecular graphics and related programs to deduce the common determinants among the nearly 15 DeH enzymes with known crystal structures. The fact that only A-B pairs of DeHs channel NADH provides us an excellent opportunity to achieve these objectives. In a highly related study, the channeling of metabolites in situ will also be tested using permeabilized PC12 cells.  %%%  Enzymes are responsible for all basic metabolic reactions as well as other reactions, e.g., those replicating and translating the genetic information of cells and the signaling processes of cells. The classical model of the cell assumes that most of the enzymes (and consequently also their metabolic products) of the major metabolic pathways are randomly distributed within their cell compartments. Furthermore, our understanding of the regulation of metabolism is significantly dependent on this simplifying assumption. Very strong evidence has accumulated, however, that instead, many of these enzymes are associated with the next enzyme in the metabolic sequence. This permits the direct transfer of metabolic products from one enzyme to the next without their random distribution within the cell comp artment. If this occurs, metabolic properties will be significantly different from those that we currently assume to exist. Consequently, we plan to test for the presence of these enzyme associations among an important class of enzymes and to also determine the consequences of these associations on the metabolic reactions that these enzymes catalyze. For technical reasons, these enzyme associations are much smaller outside the cell than within. Thus special methods are required to detect the associations outside the cell and measurements of channeling in situ will also be attempted. In addition, the molecular structures of many of these enzymes are now known from x-ray studies. Thus we shall correlate these molecular structures with the enzyme association and metabolic properties.  ***  ??",
