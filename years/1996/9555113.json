 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to refine a course and develop a text in  cryptography, the science of designing methods to disguise secret  messages.  The  goal is to provide an innovative  alternative  in  introductory mathematics for beginning nonscience majors as  well  as  students preparing for certification in elementary  and  high  school   mathematics.   Through  this  thematic   approach,   the  objective is to sharpen students' critical thinking skills and to  stimulate  their interest in the use of mathematics in the  daily  operations  of  society. This course is serving to  replace  more  traditional  beginning  courses  such  as  college  algebra   and  trigonometry and finite mathematics, and is appropriate  for  all  entering  college  students.  The course covers classical  cipher  systems (systems used during the World Wars, for example), modern  encryption  systems,  and error-correcting  codes.  Some  of  the  topics  being  presented  in the text are  substitution  ciphers,  transposition ciphers, the RSA Algorithm, digital signatures, the  Knapsack  Algorithm, and one-way functions used for PIN security.  Mathematical  topics to be presented at the beginning  level  are  modular   arithmetic,   probability   and   statistics,    matrix  arithmetic,  number  theory,  and  combinatorics.  In  an  active  learning  environment  utilizing technology,  these  mathematical  tools  are  used  to guide students in breaking and  constructing  cipher  systems, and in determining the strength and  utility  of  ciphers.  The radical difference in this course and the \"sampler\"  courses  that  have  been  taught  in  the  past  is  that   many  mathematical  notions can be introduced under the one  canopy  of  cryptography,  with its obvious historical significance  and  its  critical modem-day importance.  The project is being disseminated  via  a preliminary manual for the course to selected institutions  that are beta testing the materials in classes, presentations  at  national  meetings,   and preparation of  a  text  for  commercial  publication.  An  experienced evaluation  team  is  providing  an  intensive evaluation of the project.",
