 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on two issues related to the contracting  approach to monetary policy design.  First, the project addresses  a range of questions dealing with the implementation of  incentives, the relationship of alternative policy mechanisms  such as central bank independence and inflation targeting to the  type of incentive structures suggested by optimal central bank  contracts, and the effects of information on the feasibility of  achieving optimal policy outcomes.  Second, the project advances  our understanding of the means through which central bank  independence leads to differences in macroeconomic outcomes by  examining the role of delegation, the factors that determine the  optimal degree of delegation, and the consequences for monetary  and fiscal interactions of alternative aspects of the delegation  of monetary policy authority.  The project address these issues  both through theoretical modelling and applied regression  analysis.    The results of this project will clarify how mechanisms such as  inflation targeting combined with central bank announcements  might be used to implement the types of optimal incentive  structures emphasized in the contracting approach to the design  of monetary policy.  The project will also identify the issues  that are important for determining the degree of delegation that  is optimal in the conduct of monetary policy and how the presence  of institutions that are insulated from direct electoral  influences may actually promote democratic stability.  These  results will contribute to the ongoing debate on the consequences  of alternative institutional structures for central banks and the  role of inflation targeting as a framework for the conduct of  monetary policy.",
