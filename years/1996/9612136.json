 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612136    Accurate prediction of ground movements due to tunnels and  deep excavations  is not only an important part in the design of lateral earth  retention  systems, but is also essential for estimating the risk of  damage to  surrounding facilities.  Deformation prediction is an  integral part of the  design-construction process, and provides a framework for  interpretation of  instrumentation measurements during construction and for  extrapolating  limited measurements made at early construction stages to  assess the impact  of construction activities.    This research project is directed toward improving the  quality of numerical  predictions of ground movements and structural requirements  associated with  deep excavations and tunneling in soils, and to further  develop the use of  numerical analysis as a design tool.  A new advanced  effective stress  constitutive model will be implemented which unifies the  modeling of clays,  sands and silts into a finite element code able to perform  coupled flow and  soil deformation analysis.  A fundamental but \"realistic\"  evaluation of  major factors controlling the performance of deep  excavations and tunnel  will be completed.  The capabilities of the model will be  validated through  comparison with performance using a well documented study of  a tunnel and  cut-and-cover section in San Francisco Bay mud, a process  which will  include a) extensive field instrumentation, b) complete  characterization of  the soil profile, and  c) a well documented history of the  construction  sequence and relevant events which occur during the project.  ***",
