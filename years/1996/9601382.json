 "awd_abstract_narration": "9601382  Roberts    One of the most interesting features of the nervous system  is the fact that it is able to undergo functional changes.  These changes may occur due to experience - learning - or  may be based upon internally generated changes in nerve cell  physiology and biochemistry.  One common change in nerve  cell function, that has been observed in virtually all  organisms including humans, are the changes that follow the  daily environmental cycle of light and darkness.  Interestingly, these daily changes in nerve cell function  are not reflexive responses to the environment, but instead  are regulated by an internal timing system.  The internal  timing system is controlled by circadian pacemakers (circa -  about dies - a day) or \"biological clocks\" located in the  brain or other neural structures.  Investigation of  circadian pacemakers over the past several years has  indicated that disruption in the function of the circadian  clock, and the circadian timing system, leads to multiple  problems in human physiology.  Furthermore, the interaction  between the circadian timing system (internal rhythmicity)  is of critical importance in gaining a full understanding of  an organism's relationship with its environment.  Finally,  it has been shown that biological clocks function through  the interaction of many intracellular biochemical processes  such as gene transcription, translation, and protein  modification.  The purpose of our work is to investigate the  biochemistry of circadian clock function in a model neural  system.  In these studies we will analyze the role played by  two specific classes of protein (cyclin-dependent kinases,  and mitogen activated protein kinases) that we propose are  important in the generation and regulation of the circadian  rhythm produced in the eye of the marine snail, Bulla  gouldiana.  Investigation of several different circadian  pacemakers has shown that clock function has been conserved  in a diverse group of organisms.  Thus, our studies should  pr ovide general insights concerning the biochemistry of  circadian rhythm generation.",
