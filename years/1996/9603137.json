Majumdar, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur.  The proposed  research entitled Low Temperature Studies of Hall Effect and  Specific Heat in Amorphous Alloys will determine the correlations  between the electrical and magnetic properties of metallic glasses.   While considerable progress has been made in cataloging and  explaining electrical transport in paramagnetic glassy metals, the  relative importance of nonmagnetic processes and those associated  with magnetism and magnetic scattering processes in amorphous  magnetic alloys has not been completely established.  The U.S.  group has been among the most active studying electron transport  and surface chemistry of nonmagnetic amorphous alloys, and the  Indian group has been a major factor in the study of electron  transport in magnetic glassy metals.  The expertise and  experimental capabilities of the two groups are highly  complementary and will combine well to accomplish the research  objectives.     Scope:  In the United States the study of amorphous metals had, at  one time, been far more intensive than in India.  However,  research priorities in the United States have shifted to other areas.   Presently, no research programs are funded solely for the study of  amorphous metals.  The main effort on this topic in India and  perhaps worldwide will be performed by Majumdar and his group  at Kanpur.  U.S. collaboration will insure access to major  experimental research on amorphous metals, access to the resulting  technology at low cost, and the furthering of basic understanding  on transport in amorphous alloys.        ***",
