The past decade has seen an increase in the use of criminal penalties for environmental violations.  However, the effectiveness of these sanctioning strategies at deterring potential environmental offenders is not well understood.  This research focuses specifically on the perceptions by the population at risk of committing hazardous waste offenses of the formal and informal sanctions used to enforce hazardous waste laws.  The research is based in the state of Florida.  It uses a two-pronged approach.  The primary focus will be the analysis of 100 in-depth face-to-face interviews with employees of companies subject to hazardous waste regulation.  The second focus will be the collection and analysis of contextual data on the past, present, and future enforcement practices of the state of Florida.  %%%%  The laws and regulations governing activities that have the potential to create risks of environmental harm have become both increasingly punitive and complex.
