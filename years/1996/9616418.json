The conference is to address state of the art developments in pollution prevention and sustainable technology, with an emphasis on clean products and processes.    The objective of the conference is to bring together recognized experts from industry, academia and government for the purpose of presenting, exchanging and discussing information dealing with the cooperative design, development, manufacture and use of products and processes that provide reduced risked to human health and the ecology.  More specifically, the conference will provide a forum for exchange of information covering topics such as clean product technologies, green chemistry and engineering, life cycle analysis (LCA) and full cost accounting, computer based design tools, clean energy production and use, and applied pollution prevention (P2) solutions.    The expected benefits are the stimulation, growth and advancement of pollution prevention practices on an international scale.    The Engineering Foundation (New York) will assume prime responsibility for admission, logistics, mechanics, publicity, coordination of housing, and finances for the conference.  ***",
