 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to undertake theoretical and  empirical research into the problem of fraudulent claims filed in  insurance markets.  A growing body of empirical work aims to  document the existence of fraudulent or exaggerated claims in  selected insurance markets, and to aid insurers in identifying  particular claims which may be fraudulent.  Theoretical analyses  have focused on designing optimal schemes for the auditing of  claims which are filed to detect and deter fraudulent claims.   This project fills and an important gap in both the theoretical  and empirical literature on insurance fraud by considering  contractual mechanisms by which insures might manage the problem  of fraud.  Rather than simply designing and implementing ex-post  situations such as claims audits, the project examines how the  initial insurance contract might be designed in order to provide  incentives of claimants not to cheat.  Since efficient policy  approaches to the problem of fraud are likely to entail ex-ante  incentives as well as ex-post sanctions, this research promises  to provide important insights into a heretofore ignored aspect of  effective fraud management.  The theoretical contracting model  will be tested using a large and detailed dataset on automobile  settlements.",
