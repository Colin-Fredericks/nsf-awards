 "awd_abstract_narration": "9601968  Rao         Funds for acquisition of research instrumentation are  provided for the development of multidisciplinary research  facilities in intelligent control systems.  The University of  Missouri-Rolla (UMR) has identified intelligent control as part  of its emphasis areas in manufacturing and civil infrastructure  for research and training.  A multidisciplinary research team at  UMR is actively pursuing research in this area and has been quite  successful in obtaining the support of federal agencies.  This  instrumentation will significantly expand the research and  training capabilities in the area of intelligent control systems. The instrumentation package consists of (i) real-time control  systems and hardware-in-the-loop simulation systems, (ii)  connected network of adaptive processor systems (CNAPS) for  hardware implementation of neural networks, (iii) real-time  neural network and fuzzy logic control development system, (iv)  multi-channel dynamic signal analyzer, (v) vision and image  processing system for vision-based intelligent control, and (vi)  a cluster of advanced workstations.  This instrumentation package  supports the multidisciplinary research and training efforts in  real-time implementation of intelligent control area.  The senior  undergraduate and graduate students and faculty members from the  departments of electrical engineering, civil engineering,  chemical engineering, and mechanical and aerospace engineering  will benefit from the proposed equipment.  This equipment will  interface with existing laboratories and enhances the research  infrastructure of UMR.       The primary research areas/research training to be supported  by the proposed instrumentation are: (i) basic research in  intelligent control; (ii) intelligent control of smart  structures; (iii) structural control; (iv) intelligent control in  manufacturing; (v) intelligent control applications in aerospace  vehicles; (vi) intelligent control of power systems and drives;  (vii) intelligent pro cess control; (viii) combined research-  curriculum development projects; (ix) laboratory support for  senior undergraduate/graduate level courses in neural networks  for control, fuzzy logic control, control of smart structures,  and flexible power system control.  ***  ??",
