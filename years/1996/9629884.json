 "awd_abstract_narration": "9629884  \"Workshop on Integrated Research for Civil Infrastructure\"\"  Dr. Rae Zimmerman and Dr. Roy Sparrow, Wagner Graduate  School, New York  University      The integration of engineering, the sciences (social,  behavioral, economic,  physical, natural, and materials science), and mathematics  is important to  the conceptualization and implementation of infrastructure  performance  needs, which require an interdisciplinary focus.  This  workshop will bring  together experts from a variety of academic disciplines as  well as  professional settings to address research needs and  opportunities in the  are of integrated assessments for infrastructure  performance.  A  multidisciplinary perspective will be supported by the use  of three  co-chairpersons from engineering, the social, behavioral,  and economic  sciences; and the physical, natural, and materials sciences  and  mathematics, who will join the New York  University/Polytechnic University  team in planning and carrying out the workshop.  It will  build on the  experiences of prior workshops.  The workshop will be  designed to promote a  dialogue among the participants to address where research is  needed to  promote integrated infrastructure assessment, what the  opportunities are,  where the gaps are, and what mechanisms or approaches are  appropriate to  address these research issues.  A report will be prepared  containing  workshop recommendations on these issues, and wider  dissemination of the  results will be considered.  ***",
