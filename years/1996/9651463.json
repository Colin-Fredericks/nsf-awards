 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project brings microwave sample preparation into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. While there is widespread use of microwave sample preparation in industrial settings, there is limited evidence in the literature describing its application to undergraduate education. The introduction of microwave sample preparation to the analytical laboratory is giving students training on a widely used instrument and expanding the types of laboratory activities that may be reasonably conducted.   For example, in Quantitative Analysis classes, new and modified experiments are introducing the basics of microwave sample preparation, using everyday samples to provide a greater \"real-world\" feel. In the Instrumental Analysis class, a 4-week advanced lab component is being added, where the time limitations of sample preparation have limited the challenge of previous student projects. In the Advanced Analytical Chemistry class, microwave sample preparation is being added as part of a laboratory comparing new and traditional sample preparation methods. Students participating in an interdisciplinary study-abroad environmental science class, and in the growing undergraduate research program at the university also are employing this equipment.   The equipment is allowing the use of microwave sample preparation in all analytical chemistry classes and improving undergraduate research opportunities, which is better preparing students for industry and graduate school. Because the project is modifying traditional experiments and developing new ones, it serves other educators, by providing approaches for the adoption of microwave digestion techniques in their classes.",
