 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  EEC-9616398  Garrison    This award provides funding for a \"TIE\" grant involving three NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers:  the University of Washington's Center for Analytical Chemistry; New Jersey Institute of Technology's Center for Emission Reduction; and the University of Tennessee's Center for Measurement and Control.  The goal is to develop improved methods for the design and operation of batch chemical processes.  Such processes are becoming increasingly important as the U.S. chemical industry gears up for more new pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals.  The specific aims are:    Allow systematic synthesis of process flowsheets as sequences of operating steps in a way that minimizes or eliminates waste production.    Provide computer simulation tools for control/operability analysis of a given flowsheet.  This will allow detection of potential hazards and inefficiencies so they can be eliminated during the design phase rather than after the plant has been put into operation.    Develop process monitoring methods to allow fault detection and feedback control operating units.    The three centers will work cooperatively to advance the above goals, sharing software and information by electronic transfer over the Internet, and by other means.  Industrial sponsors of the Centers will also participate (in technical meetings) to ensure that the project activities are relevant to their needs.",
