 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sarker  9622306   The primary goal of this research is to develop a machine-sequence and an optimal layout for a multi-product assembly or fabrication line in which the analysis of the work-in-process (WIP) flow is a vital ingredient for decision making.  Similar products are usually grouped together to form part-families along with the set of required machines, and these machines are then assigned to locations along a transporter line within each cell to form a flowline.  Given the routings of jobs, the machines are assigned to locations along the lines with the intention of minimizing the travel distance.  Backtracking is assumed as a base problem to solve a general case of sets of unique and/or identical machines, with bi-directional flow of jobs in one or two dimensional layout for each cell.  The solution procedure consists of three distinct phases: (1) cell (clustering) formation, (2) cell (flowline) location, and (3) machine sequencing for multi-product flowline.   The research has a potential to contribute toward solving computationally intractable problems in flexible/cellular manufacturing systems.  This research is likely to lead to efficient cell formations, better job routing, scheduling and process control, and will cause an improvement in system performance measures such as machine utilization, transporter utilization, throughput rate and makespan of jobs.  The research has strong theoretical underpinnings, as well as considerable potential for cost and time savings in industry.",
