 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Streitwieser at   the University of California-Berkeley is to continue his studies on the   reaction dynamics of polar organometallic reagents. Through experimental   as well as theoretical chemistry, a more thorough understanding of the   factors governing the aggregation of these complexes and their relative   reactivities will be garnered. One of the major questions still   confounding investigators in this area is the state of reagent   aggregation versus reactivity. This proposal addresses this issue. Since   these reagents are ubiquitous in organic synthesis, an understanding that   allows scientists to predict the reactivity with regard to   chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity would have significant impact on   the use.  Synthetic organic chemistry which is responsible for new methodologies   and actual preparations of physiologically active compounds relies   heavily on specific reagents to effect certain organic transformations.   Some of these reagents are complex and have a variety of forms. Since the   exact form affects the efficiency of its reactivity, it is important to   understand the factors influencing these reagents. This proposed effort   will address these issues with regard to polar organometallic reagents.",
