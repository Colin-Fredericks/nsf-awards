Electrostriction is a fourth rank tensor  property  relating  mechanical strain to the square  of  the  electric  field.   The principal goal of this project is to carry  out  electromechanical  measurements  on  ceramics  and   glasses  representative of the inorganic materials used in multilayer  packaging,    metal-on-silicon   devices,    high    voltage  insulators,  optical  fibers,  micro-electrical   mechanical  systems,  and thick film substrates. Among the materials  to  be  studied  are silica, silicon nitride, alumina,  aluminum  nitride,  forsterite, spinel, mullite, cordierite,  silicate  glasses,  mica,  and porcelain.  The PI and his  group  have  developed  two techniques for measuring the electrostriction  coefficients  of ceramics and glasses.  The 'direct'  method  involves measuring the field-induced strain with a carefully  calibrated  optical interferometer.  The  'converse'  method  entails monitoring the dielectric constant as a function  of  mechanical stress.  The principal purpose of this project is  to formulate structure-property relationships describing the  dependence  of  the electrostrictive coefficient  on  atomic  bond  type,  atomic  bond  length,  crystal  structure,  and  chemical    composition    of    the    material.      Since  electrostriction  is the primary coupling mechanism  between  electric polarization and mechanical strain, the PI hopes to  identify correlations between electrostriction coefficients,  elastic compliance, and dielectric permittivity.  %%%  The  electrical,  mechanical,  and  thermal  properties   of  packaging  materials have been investigated thoroughly  over  the   years,  but  reliable  data  on  the  electrostriction  coefficients  of low-permittivity  ceramics and  glasses  are  scarce.  The goal of the proposed research is to measure the  electrostriction  coefficient of a variety  of  ceramic  and  glass  materials.   Electrostriction is a fourth rank tensor  property  relating mechanical strain to the  square  of  the  electric field.  It is present in all insulators and becomes  especially important in the ferroelectric ceramics  used  as  capacitors  and transducers, and in electronic  and  optical  devices  where  extremely  high  fields  are  present.  This  includes  optical  fibers,  high voltage  insulators,  laser  windows,   multilayer   electronic   packages,   thin   film  components and thick film substrates. In these materials the  stresses  and  strains caused by electric fields  are  often  surprisingly  large,  making electrostriction  an  important  degradation   mechanism.   If  materials   having   a   zero  electrostrictive coefficient could be found, the reliability  of  electronic  and optical devices based on  that  material  could be significantly improved.  ***",
