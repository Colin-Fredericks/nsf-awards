The  accuracy  of an estimate is determined  partly by the quality of the estimator and partly by chance.  Traditionally  the  chance element was  accounted for by the conditional  or the  Bayesian  approach,  which require an ancillary or a prior distribution. However, the  chance  element can exist  without either.  The first part of the research  tackles this  problem by direct estimation of loss via asymptotic expansions and geometric  analyses.  A  particular  result  obtained  in this  direction is that  the  inverted  observed information  best approximates  the squared  error.  The  second part of the research is concerned with improving the  second-order accuracy   of an estimating equation.  Two methods were  previously  proposed,  but they are  inapplicable  to an important  type of  situations,  which  motivates  this  project.  In addition, several previously unknown properties of estimating   equations are investigated in the light of their  analogy with the    second-order  properties  of the classical maximum  likelihood  estimator.  This research will  yield  deeper  understanding  and  more  effective use of semiparametric methods.  %%%       The recent advances in science,  particularly in medical, biological,  sociological,  and ecological studies, have drastically increased the scale  and complexity  of data sets.  This change,  hand in hand with the ever increasing  computer power, gives new challenges to traditional statistical methodologies.  One  area of  studies  that these challenges  have brought about is that of  estimating equations, which is the focus of the present research. Estimating  equations  allow scientists  to model directly the  parameters which are of  the most  interest  without making  excessive  assumptions  (as traditional  methods often do),  whose violat ions would  impair the inference  about the  parameters.  Estimating equations are especially useful for data  sets with complicated  dependence  structures, such as longitudinal studies  and the studies of plants  scattered in a natural environment.  The studies  of estimating  equations have  undergone vigorous  advances during the past  decades,  most of which,  however,  are concerned with what might be called  the coarser-level aspects (or first-order aspects).  Whereas the studies of  the  finer-level  aspects (or second-order properties)  have just  begun to  catch up. The second-order aspects of estimating equations are systematically  investigated in the present research.",
