To sustain and invigorate the proposed research infrastructure, three supportive components are proposed:     - Computing Facilities Component   - Education and Training Component, and   - Summer Programs Component    The computing facilities component proposes to provide the high performance computing facilities consisting of workstations and high-end PCs, as well as necessary software tools, to support both applicative and fundamental research in high performance computing.    The Education and Training component proposes to develop students and faculty interests and skills in high performance computing methodology through structured courses, seminars, workshops, and hands-on training in the usage of high performance computing machinery at national laboratories.    The Summer Programs Components envisages bringing high school students, from 9th through 12th grade levels in varying periods of summer, and train them in problem solving as well as internet access and multi-media applications.  The additional objective of this component is to intensively involve undergraduate/graduate students and faculty in high performance computing research through summer programs at national labs.  ***",
