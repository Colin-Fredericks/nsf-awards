 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the verification aspect in the  development of reliable, fault-tolerant, distributed  protocols.  High-performance computing technology, such as distributed real-  time systems, high-performance memory systems, wide-band I/O  systems,  modular operating systems, high-speed network  interfaces, commodity workstation clusters, and the like, is  reliant on an underlying layer of distributed software (often  implemented in hardware), which consists of suites of protocols  for check-pointing, communication, coordination, data  distribution, recovery, and synchronization of distributed  components.  These protocols provide a critical software layer  for high-performance computing systems. Having such a  standardized layer is crucial to interoperability,  portability,scalability, and reusability of existing software.  Unfortunately, developing reliable software for distributed  environments is a notoriously difficult task.  Here reliability  refers  to pre-committed real-time performance, dynamic  reconfigurability, security, robustness, and high assurance.  The  difficulty in producing reliable distributed software is twofold.  First, designing reliable distributed software is extremely  challenging.  Not only does the software have to be free from  programming errors, but it also has to be resilient against  hardware and software faults.  Second, because of the  nondeterministic behavior of distributed environment, it is very  difficult to verify that the software meets its desired  specification.   The focus of this project is on the study of  algorithms and data structures applicable to the verification of  programs.  It draws upon ideas and results from logic, graph  theory, and automata theory, combining both theoretical and  experimental aspects.  ***",
