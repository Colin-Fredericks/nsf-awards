 "awd_abstract_narration": "Imaging is fueling research and revolutionizing industry. This area of research, traditionally viewed as highly specialized, is becoming mainstream. Laboratories have been developed that teach college freshmen how to create filters that manipulate images. The early introduction of imaging technology creates an opportunity to address important questions about imaging and allows students to participate in interesting computer science learning as freshmen. Students learn about programming, using arrays and modifying classes. The use of object-oriented techniques has made it possible for students to easily enhance the functionality of an imaging system by adding filter member functions to preexisting classes. This project provides funding for several digital cameras and a color printer. These tools provide students with a more comprehensive view of the imaging process.",
