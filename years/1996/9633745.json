 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Gary Feinman, Mr. Christopher Fisher will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. Currently Mr. Fisher is conducting archaeological research in the Lake Patzcuaro Basin in Western Mexico and National Science Foundation support will allow radiocarbon analyses to date cultural features, examination of botanical samples and the study of geological sediments. The Lake Patzcuaro Basin figures prominently in Mesoamerican prehistory because of the large prehistoric state which developed in that region and which challenged the Aztecs for domination. At the time of European contact, the area was the core of a Tarascan state which controlled most of Western Mexico. Recent archaeological investigations in the basin have revealed large tracts of relict raised fields, canals and small scale settlements located on recently exposed lake bed. This land was inundated at the time of European contact and both archaeological and paleo-environmental evidence suggest that these features date to the Late Classic period. The intact nature of this previously unknown wetland agricultural complex and the ability to date the agricultural features and settlements provides an excellent research opportunity. Mr. Fisher is currently excavating the field system to obtain data which will allow placement of the water management features within a regional archaeological context. Samples recovered during the excavation will be radiocarbon dated to establish chronology. In addition, extensive botanical and pedalogical analysis will be conducted to further characterize sediments. These data will be combined with settlement pattern information and on this basis it will be possible to elucidate the relationships between environmental modification, demographic growth and the changing political organization in the Lake Patzcuaro region.       Archaeologists wish to understand how complex societies develop and reach a state level of organization. They have noted that in many areas of the world, the appearance of hierarchical social systems and large scale agricultural projects such as irrigation systems seem to go hand and hand. Yet the exact causal relationships and the factors which lead to both these phenomena are not well understood. Traditional approaches to this question in Latin American prehistory have tended to emphasize population pressure and centralized bureaucratic management as necessary preconditions for the construction and maintenance of intensive agricultural projects. However recent archaeological investigation has challenged this perspective and suggested that such management systems can be found in pre-state contexts. Much of this research however is inconclusive and Mr. Fisher's work will contribute information of direct relevance.       This research is important for several reasons. It will shed new light on the processes which underly the development of early states. It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists and assist in training a promising young scientist.",
