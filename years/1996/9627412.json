Hopkins at the   Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The research is in elliptic cohomology, in   particular with its relationship to other areas of mathematics such as homotopy theory and   conformal field theory.  %%%   The Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships are awards to   recent recipients of doctoral degrees in the mathematical sciences. These awards are a   means of contributing to the future vitality of the scientific effort of the nation. As   researchers in the mathematical sciences expand their interactions with other disciplines,   and as the interplay increases between the various areas of mathematics itself,   opportunities for postdoctoral research and training are becoming increasingly important.   The Fellowships are designed to permit awardees to choose research environments that   will have maximal impact on their future scientific development. The fellowship is   designed to provide 24 months of support divided into 18 academic-year months and three   periods of two summer months. The recipient may choose (1) the Research Fellowship   option which allows for full time support for any 18 academic year months in a three year   period, in intervals not shorter than 3 consecutive months or (2) the Research   Instructorship option which allows the 18 months of academic year support to be taken as   nine months of full time support and 18 months of half time support. Not more than two   months of summer support from this Fellowship may be received in any calendar year.  ***",
