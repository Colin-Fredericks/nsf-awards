 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  Smith  9622875    Smith will continue his research into the propagation of waves   in nonhomogeneous mediums with ``rough'' sound speeds. The aim is to   establish minimal differentiability assumptions on the metric determining   the sound speed under which certain bounds on the solutions, known as the   Strichartz estimates, hold. Under previous NSF funding, the investigator   has shown that these bounds hold if the second order derivatives of the   metric coefficients are bounded, and that this is the best possible  condition of its sort that insures the validity of the Strichartz estimates.   The proposed research includes replacing this condition by sharper,   geometrically intrinsic ones. It is anticipated that the optimal condition   is that the metric posess one bounded derivative, and in addition that the   coefficients of the curvature tensor (certain combinations of second order   derivatives) be bounded. The investigator is also continuing research into   the development of function spaces adapted to oscillatory integral and   hyperbolic problems. Previous NSF funding supported the development of a   family of Hardy spaces adapted to fixed-time estimates for solutions of the   wave equation. The proposed research includes developing similar spaces   adapted to controlling time-averaged norms of solutions.      The study of waves travelling in media with rough sound speeds (that is,   where the speed may vary sharply from one point to another) is of both   theoretical and practical significance. The theoretical interest comes from   nonlinear equations, such as the Einstein equations for gravitation, in   which the wave speed depends on the solution under consideration. Since   rough solutions arise naturally, one needs to understand how waves travel   in rough media to show that solutions exist, and to understand their   properties. Physics predicts that energy should travel along geodesics,   curves that represent the shortest path between points. Our research is   sh owing that this is true even for rough sound speeds, under essentially   the weakest assumptions that assure that geodesics exist and are well   defined. The practical significance is that our research yields a   mathematical construction for solving the wave equation, which is valid  for rough sound speeds and stable under perturbations of the medium. It is   clear that a computational algorithm based on such a construction will be   inherently more stable than one requiring more restrictive conditions on   the media. Our research would help establish that such algorithms are both   stable and convergent.",
