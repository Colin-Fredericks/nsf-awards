 "awd_abstract_narration": "A plan is presented to study the mechanistic and ecological aspects of  plant interactions with the abiotic environment; with microbes,  including mycorrhizae; and with herbivorous insects. We request funds  for a High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Workstation  (Beckman  Instrument Bioseparation Gradient HPLC \"System Gold\" (Model 126  Programmable Solvent Module and Model 166 Ultraviolet/Visible Detector)  and a Bio-Rad Automatic Sampling System (Model AS-100) , a fluorometer   Perkin Elmer model LS 50B \"Luminescence Spectrometer\" , and a  spectrophotometer  Hitachi U-1100 Spectrophotometer with sample  sipper . These systems will be used to support research in three  laboratories at the University of Colorado; all of which are involved  in the analysis and quantification of a variety of chemical compounds  important in ecological processes. In the laboratory of Professor Deane  Bowers, research is focused on the analysis of plant and insect primary  and secondary compounds that are important in tritrophic interactions  (plants-herbivorous insects-natural enemies). Research in the  laboratory of Professor Steve Schrnidt is in two major areas. In the  first, biodegradation of pentachlorophenol (PCP) by microorganisms is  studied; and the second is a collaborative project with Professor  Russell Monson. This collaborative research studies alpine nutrient  cycling at several levels: the processes and mechanisms of amino acid  uptake by alpine plants, and amino acid uptake in relation to  plant-microbe interactions, including mycorrhizae. The efforts of these  three laboratories will be greatly enhanced by the availability ofthe  requested equipment, which is presently unavailable, unreliable and  out-of-date, or heavily used for research in other laboratories.",
