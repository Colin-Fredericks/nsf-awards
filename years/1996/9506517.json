 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506517  Jacobsen  The compositional variation of the present-day mantle results from a number of crust-mantle and intra-mantle differentiation processes operating over geologic time.  Some of these ancient processes many have been markedly different from those occurring today.  The production of continental crust has had the greatest influence in establishing the composition of the present-day mantle, but exactly how and when this occurred is controversial.  It is proposed to conduct a series of high quality geochemical measurements of modern and ancient mafic to ultramafic lavas and their melt inclusions that will yield new insights into the secular evolution in the composition of the mantle.  Foremost among these studies will be the use of microbeam techniques on olivine-hosted melt inclusions in ancient lavas to determine the compositional characteristics of the primary lavas and their source regions.  Komatiitic samples containing olivine-hosted melt inclusions from widely varying temporal and spatial associations will be investigated.  These microbeam techniques will also be applied to determine the compositions of glassy portions of modern oceanic basalts in order to establish variations in \"constant ratios\" of incompatible elements in the lavas and their source regions.  Characterizing the secular evolution of the composition of the mantle will lead to a enhanced understanding of crust-mantle and intra-mantle differentiation processes and the rate at which they occurred.",
