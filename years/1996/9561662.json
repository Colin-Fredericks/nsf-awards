 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore the synthesis of polymer-based catalysts for methanol electro-oxidation to carbon dioxide.  A novel in situ electrochemical nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method will be used for characterization of the catalyst.  The research will address molecular principles of reactivity enhancement in heterogeneous oxidative electrocatalysis with bimetal platinum/ruthenium (Pt/Ru) electrodes and with the electrodes supplemented by ternary components.  The objectives will be to synthesize polypyrrole-embedded Pt/Ru nanoparticles to produce an efficient catalysis and to characterize the catalyst and how it works.  The research will drawn upon recent progress in electrocatalysis, such as: (i) the demonstration of promising carbon monoxide poison-tolerant properties of polymer-embedded metal particles in methanol electro-oxidation; (ii) an ability to form micro- and nano-scale particles of platinum metals reproducibly in conducting polymers; and (iii) progress in solid-state NMR and electro-analytical methodology in electrochemical surface science.  Phase I will study the particle size effect on the methanol oxidative electrocatalysis, as well as the particle composition in terms of the Pt/Ru ratio, and the addition of ternary copper and rhodium.  Polypyrrole-embedded Pt/Ru nanoparticles will be used, supported on a gold substrate.  The principal methods will be voltammetry, chrono-amperometry, and electrochemical NMR.  High reactivity is expected to be obtained as well as insights into the fuel cell electrode process and oxidative heterogeneous electrocatalysis.       This research will provide a base for new alloy- and chemically-modified electrode materials in conducting polymeric matrices for poison-free current generation in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs).  Mobil electric power uses of DMFCs may be used in the electric-car Next Generation Vehicle (NGV).  Phase II of this project would provide scale-up of selected catalysts for commercialization.",
