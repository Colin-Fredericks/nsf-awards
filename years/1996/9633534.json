 "awd_abstract_narration": "9633534  Nabelek    On February 17, 1996, a great earthquake M=8.2 occurred along the  northwestern coast of Irian Jaya, Indonesia.  Initial reports show  wide-spread destruction of the coastal communities resulting from  strong shaking and a large tsunami.  This research, in cooperation  with Indonesian scientists, will take advantage of an extraordinary  opportunity to use advanced prrtable seismic instrumentation and  space-based geodesy to study the distortion due to the event,  including a rare opportunity to measure co-seismic slip  distribution during a great subduction earthquake.  It is also and  opportunity to study the interaction of parallel thrust and strike-  slip faults that display slip partitioning during the earthquake  sequence.  This part of the subduction fault was considered to be  largely inactive based on past seismicity, seismic reflection  profiles of the New Guinea trench, and recent geodetic  measurements.  The grant will support operation of a temporary  seismograph network on the hanging wall of the thrust to map the  fault with aftershocks, and measurement of the static uplift of the  coastal areas by measuring coseismic sea level changes.   Reoccupation of the geodetic GPS site established in the area from  previous grants will be supported there.  This research is funded  under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research Program and is a  component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.",
