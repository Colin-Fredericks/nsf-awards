 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Ahmed Shabana and a graduate  student of the University of Illinois at Chicago to  collaborate in engineering research with Dr. Richard  Schwertassek and others of the Institute of Robotics and  System Dynamics of the German Aerospace Research  Establishment (DLR.)  This German organization is widely  recognized as one of the premier aerospace research  institutions in Europe if not the world, and the  participating institute is very highly regarded for its  state-of-the-art research.  The US and German partners in  this project are interested in computational aspects of the  mechanics, mechatronics and control of constrained  deformable bodies such as large scale structures intended  for orbit around the earth.  The goal of their research is  to develop more efficient and robust methods for the dynamic  analysis and control of large scale flexible systems.  More  specifically, they plan to develop new computer and  numerical algorithms for the efficient solution of  constrained deformable body dynamic equations, by taking  into account the effects of mechatronics and control  parameters.  They intend to evaluate the effects of  different linearization schemes on control system  performance and develop guidelines which can be applied to  identify the most useful dynamics and control methodology  for a particular application.  This collaboration benefits  from the complementary expertise of the US group in  computational mechanics and the German group in the  experimental control and mechatronics of flexible systems.",
