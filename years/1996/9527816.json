 "awd_abstract_narration": "Elliot and Foland  OPP 9527816    Abstract  This award supports a project to investigate igneous rocks  associated with the break-up of the Gondwanaland supercontinent.  The initial break-up of Gondwanaland during the Mesozoic was  associated with a major magmatic event during which voluminous  extrusive lava flows and intrusive sills and dikes were formed.  Study of these igneous products which are related to large-scale  processes of continental disruption is important in constraining  the temporal and spatial nature of break-up.  This magmatism is  expressed by the Karoo tholeiites of southern Africa and related  rocks in Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica, and by Ferrar tholeiites  of the Transantarctic Mountains.  The geochronology of mafic  igneous intrusive and extrusive events will be examined in  Antarctica in two distinct areas: in Dronning Maud Land and in  the Ross Sea sector of the Transantarctic Mountains.  The former  is directly associated with the initial rifting which separated  Africa from Antarctica while the latter, the Ferrar, has a less  direct relationship but nevertheless is part of the initial phase  of igneous activity.    The objectives of the research are to: (1) establish the time of  emplacement and duration of the Mesozoic magmatism in Dronning  Maud Land; (2) refine the geochronology of the Ferrar Group with  the application of U/Pb zircon dating as well as 40Ar/39Ar  dating; (3) establish the timing of alteration of the Vestfjella  lavas and other post-crystallization events recorded by secondary  minerals in Dronning Maud Land; and (4) evaluate possible  relationships of Dronning Maud Land magmatism and alteration to  the Lebombo Monocline in southern Africa and to the Ferrar Group  and other magmatism associated with Gondwanaland break-up.    Mineral samples will be used to date the events using the  40Ar/39Ar, U-Pb, and Rb-Sr methods.  The minerals include:  primary igneous phases (feldspar, biotite, zircon) that will be  the focus for establishing timing of ma gmatic events; and,  secondary phases (apophyllite, phyllosilicate) to address timing  of alteration events.    Based upon recent experience and success in related studies, the  results are expected to have broad implications not only for  specific questions dealing with the region but also for tectonic  models and geochronologic methods.  The results will address:  Gondwanaland break-up; spatial and temporal relations of  magmatism in Antarctica; tectonic models for the generation of  flood basalt provinces; and, application of geochronologic  methods, especially to altered basic igneous rocks.",
