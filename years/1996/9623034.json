However, intra-specific variation in mating signals is  common.  This variation is proposed to result from opposing  sexual and natural selection, but few systems are amenable  to direct tests of this hypothesis.  The specific aim of the  proposed research is to determine if selective forces shape  observed signal variation in a field cricket.  Calling  behavior in Gryllus integer is sexually selected, but  appears to be subject to natural selection by acoustically  orienting parasitoids.  To accomplish the specific goal,  research will first determine the extent of within-male  variation in calling behavior, and whether males  facultatively adjust their calling behavior when exposed to  parisitoids.  Selection experiments will then determine how  natural and sexual selection influence inter-male variation  in calling behavior over several generations.  The proposed  research will be the first experimental test of the  hypothesis that conflicting selection forces shape mating  signals within a population.",
