While much research has found differences in the direction and length of the journey to work of men versus women, relatively few of these studies have made explicit, empirically based, causal  connection to the other travel activities of women, to the entirety of the time- and space- constraints of the women, or to differences among women of different ethnic groups.  This Research Planning Grant will support the specification of a multi-city research design for a survey-based study to investigate these contexts and differences.  The research design will include household surveys, data tracking and manipulation using a geographic information system,  and data analysis using two large, structural-equation models.  Through this award, a pilot survey will be conducted in metropolitan Columbus, Ohio.    The theoretical utility of this research should be in the conceptual and empirical connection of women's travel patterns to household context, distance perception, and ethnicity.  The practical utility lies in the potential for improving traffic forecasting and transport-demand-management models, used for any kind of infrastructural planning or pollution-control scenarios.",
