 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS 96-26658  Shao  The methods of maximum likelihood estimation and likelihood ratio  test have constituted the cornerstone of statistical inference.  In numerous cases, the maximum likelihood method generates  estimates  with optimal asymptotic properties and the likelihood  ratio test is known to be powerful.  However, there are many  important practical situations where these methods break down.  This research focuses on investigating non-regular likelihood  problems including estimation problems where likelihood functions  may be unbounded (e.g., efficient estimation of a unimodal  distribution) as well as hypothesis testing problems where the  likelihood ratio test statistics do not have chi-square type  limiting distributions (e.g., testing homogeneity in Tukey  models).  This research involves generalizing the maximum product  of spacings method, which is a natural way to rectify the  problems caused by the unboundedness of likelihood functions and  to preserve the essential asymptotic optimalities usually  possessed by the maximum likelihood method.  In addition, the  research involves adapting and extending modern empirical process  techniques to characterize the asymptotic behavior of the  rescaled likelihood ratio statistic.  Scientists and engineers often build models based upon various  prior assumptions about the underlying conditions.  Very often,  these assumptions fail to  hold in real applications.  If the  model is too sensitive to small departures from those prior  assumptions, the results from such models will not be reliable,  and may be misleading with far-reaching adverse consequences.  It  is, therefore, very important to develop efficient methods to  check the validity of model assumptions, and to develop  techniques that are not constrained by unrealistic assumptions.  This research concerns efficient procedures for testing model  validity and introduces \"robust\" statistical models which remain  effective even when prior assumptions are not exactly true.  Such  proced ures have broad applications ranging from biotechnology to  high-speed computing system.  In particular, advancement in this  research area would be crucial in fostering modern manufacturing,  for it relates to developing optimal procedures for assessing  reliability and quality control.  In this respect, the research  plays an integral role in the promotion of economic growth by  improving manufacturing processes, thereby ensuring U.S.  competitiveness in world markets.",
