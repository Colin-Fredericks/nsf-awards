 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  proposed work creates human language resources to  stimulate  research   in  three  important  areas:  (a)  automatic  language  identification--  the problem of identifying the  language  being  spoken;   (b)   robust  speech  recognition--  the   problem   of  recognizing  speech  from  different  microphones,  communication  channels,   and   environmental  conditions;  and   (c)   speaker  recognition-- the problem of identifying a speaker based  on  his  or  her  voice characteristics.  To support research in automatic  language  identification, over two minutes  of  speech  from  300  speakers  in each of twenty two language is being collected.   To  support  research  in robust recognition, about  two  minutes  of  cellular   speech  from  several  thousand  speakers   is   being  collected.   To  support research in speaker recognition,  twelve  hundred   speakers  are  providing  speech  samples  during   ten  telephone  calls  over a two year period.  For each  corpus,  the  speech  is  annotated orthographically, and  a  portion  of  each  corpus   is  transcribed  phonetically.   A  critical  need   for  annotated  speech  corpora  is met by  this  work:  to  stimulate  research  in  three important areas of human language technology,  leading to secure access to the information highway by any person  who speaks a language.",
