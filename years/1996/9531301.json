 "awd_abstract_narration": "The undergraduate research participation project in the UNLV  Physics Department will be continued during the summers of  1996-1998.  The research efforts are in the areas of atomic,  molecular and optical physics, astronomy/astrophysics, and  condensed matter physics.  Students will have the  opportunity to obtain hands-on laboratory experience using  lasers, to analyze astronomical data on workstations using  image analysis software, and to perform numerical  computation and simulation using the UNLV computer  facilities.  This proposal builds upon the successful  experience of the past four years as a REU site, in which  undergraduates have engaged in research in the department.  Students will be recruited from UNLV undergraduates and from  other colleges and universities, with special attention paid  to selected schools in the West and Mid-West.  Applicants  from institutions where research opportunities are limited  will be given higher priority over those from major research  universities.",
