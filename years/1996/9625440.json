When this assessment is made, it is seen that the available inferences are   severely limited in scope by both statistical issues and computational   complexity. These two sources of limitation are intertwined, as   computational difficulties can arise from the inherent demands of   valid frequentist procedures. Ensuring the correctness   of frequentist inferences can be computationally intensive, requiring   many cumbersome evaluations of the complex expressions that derive   from higher-order asymptotic approximations. In this research, these   difficulties are overcome by a synthesis of frequentist and Bayesian   inference, as the latter approach is simpler in outlook and implementation.    In particular, the computational problem is addressed by adapting   sampling-based techniques, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo, to attain   the higher-order approximations. The result will be improved inferences   in a wide variety of practical problems; examples include logistic regression,   censored data models, and variance component estimation.   %%%  In more complicated statistical models, statisticians have typically relied   on approximate methods of inference, primarily because exact methods   can be both difficult to derive and complex to compute. However,   the validity of these approximate methods rests on the sample size being   large, which means that such methods may not be accurate in problems   with small samples. Now that inexpensive computational power has   become widely available, statisticians are attempting to use the more   realistic and complex models. For example, models used in analyzing   global environmental change, or DNA assessment, are quite complex.   The focus of t his research is to develop statistical methods that offer   both accuracy and computational tractability.  This work necessarily blends   high-performance computing with modern statistical methodology.   ***",
