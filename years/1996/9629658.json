 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past two decades, the role of female strategies in nonhuman primate societies has  become a major topic of investigation.  Studies of many primate species have shown that both  female and male behavior contribute to primate social organization.  Hamadryas baboons,  however, have long been considered to be a very male-dominated species, in which the role of  females has been assumed to be negligible.  Male behavior is distinct and highly visible in  hamadryas society: males, in trying to prevent females from mating with other males, are very  aggressive toward females and often `herd` them by biting them on the neck.  Females are  generally described as lacking opportunity, and perhaps even motivation, to escape male  coercion and behave independently.  However, both observations of hamadryas baboons in  captivity and evidence from other primate species suggest that females do pursue their own  reproductive interests, independent from the behavior of males.  This study will be the first to  investigate female mate choice and competition among wild female hamadryas baboons and will  thus help to clarify the role of females in this presumably male-dominated species.  The study  will take place in the Awash National Park, Ethiopia, over a period of 18 months.  Focal females  will be observed and social and sexual behavior between females and males, as well as  competitive interactions among females, will be recorded.  Fecal and blood samples will be analyzed genetically to determine paternity of infants born to  focal females, which will indicate the males with which females have mated and conceived.   This study will contribute to our understanding of social and sexual behavior of wild hamadryas  baboons.",
