 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    9523157  Zur Loye    In the previous funding period, it was shown that new oxide ion  conductors containing intrinsic oxygen vacancies can be readily  synthesized by creating intergrowth structures and, furthermore,  that such intergrowths can exhibit very high oxide ion  conductivities above an order-disorder transition. Although the  exact mechanism for this order-disorder transition is not yet fully  understood, it appears that by appropriate choices of structure  type and elemental compositions such transitions can be induced in  many types of intergrowth structures containing intrinsic oxygen  vacancies. This approach of creating intergrowth structures for the  synthesis of new oxide ion conductors is a general one, and can be  extended to other systems. During the proposed funding period,  major emphasis will be placed on investigating the precise  structural changes that occur during the order-disorder transitions  and on extending this work to include brownmillerite/rock salt  intergrowths and on modifying a class of materials which is  structurally related to the Aurivillius phase. It is expected that  new oxygen ion conductors will be synthesized and that their oxygen  ion conductivity and their stability in both reducing and oxidizing  conditions will be determined. The new materials will be  synthesized by high temperature solid state methods and  structurally characterized by Rietveld refinement of powder X-ray  or neutron diffraction data. Their chemical and physical properties  will be determined by standard electrical and analytical  techniques.   %%%  The objective of the proposed research is to synthesize new oxide  ion conductors and to characterize their structures, conductivities  and chemical stabilities. Oxide ion conductors have many important  applications in the areas of solid oxide fuel cells, oxygen  sensors, oxygen pumps and partial oxidation catalysts. Although  this class of materials has been known for a long time, there still  exists the general need  to develop new oxide ion conductors that  exhibit high conductivities and that are chemically stable under  both oxidizing and reducing conditions.",
