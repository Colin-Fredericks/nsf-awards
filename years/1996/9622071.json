 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to obtain a quantitative  understanding of magnetospheric hudromagnetic modes and their  coupling to external and internal sources of free energy, such as  the ring current.  Three interrelated areas of study will be  followed: (1) inner magnetospheric cavity modes, (2) general  properties of field line resonance modes, and (3) excitation of  internally-driven field line resonance modes by energetic ring  current particles.  Key questions to be examined are: (1) what is  the cavity mode structure in the inner magnetosphere and the  frequencies one should expect to see in ground and satellite  magnetic data and what is the efficiency of transport from the  outer magnetosphere, (2) what controls the field line resonant mode  radial structure, and (3) what causes the nonlinear saturation of  the drift-bounce resonant mode, and what is the self-consistent  effect of the mode on ion motion.  The methods to be employed are:  (1) for the cavity mode study, eigenmode analysis in dipole and  general geometry and MHD simulations, (2) for the field line  resonance mode study, MHD simulations in box and dipole geometry  including finite Larmor radius effects as well as ionospheric  damping, and (3) for the study of internally-driven field line  resonance modes, hybrid MHD/gyrokinetic simulations in box and  dipole geometry.  The goal is to incorporate the key physics which  has not yet been included in studies of these modes.  Comparisons  with spacecraft data will be made to test the theoretical  predictions and yield new insights into observed wave properties  and associated particle measurements.",
