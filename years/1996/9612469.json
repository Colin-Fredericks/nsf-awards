 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  solution  to  many  questions in  evolutionary  biology  and  agricultural  science depend on the accurate  estimation  of  the  level  of  genetic  variation  and  covariation  present  in  the  populations  being studied. Estimation and testing of  the  these  so-called  quantitative genetic parameters has been traditionally  based   on   restrictive  assumptions  and  a  limited   set   of  experimental procedures. The work proposed here aims to eliminate  many  of  these  restrictions  by  utilizing  recently  developed  resampling methods (primarily the jackknife and bootstrap)  as  a  means  of  providing a more general approach to  the  statistical  hypothesis  testing of quantitative genetic parameters.  Software  for  streamlining  parameter estimation and  for  performing  the  resampling analysis will be developed and tested.    A  primary concern regarding the use of resampling techniques  is  that  they must be revalidated for each application in which they  are  used.  A  great deal of time will therefore  be  devoted  to  testing   the   statistical  properties  of  the  newly   devised  resampling  procedures. Monte carlo simulations of data  sets  of  known  distribution will be analyzed using the resampling methods  developed above, and the error estimation and power properties of  these  methods tested for accuracy against the expected  results.  Once developed and validated, this software will greatly simplify  the  analysis  of  quantitative genetic data,  and  provide  many  biologists with greater confidence in the conclusions they reach.    Although quantitative genetics has been used for many decades  in  agricultural  systems, it is only in the last fifteen  or  twenty  years  that  evolutionary biologists have begun to  make  use  of  quantitative  genetic methodology. One of the  central  questions  that  has  arisen during that time is nature of the  evolutionary  change  in  the pattern of genetic variance and covariance  among  traits. This line of questio ning is usually developed in terms of  asking  whether  the genetic variance-covariance  matrix  remains  unchanged through time. Software to be developed in this proposal  will  allow  a  much  broader  set  of  questions  regarding  the  evolution  of  genetic  covariance  structure  to  be  asked.  By  utilizing    recent    developments   in    the    analysis    of  variance-covariance  methods, biologists  employing  the  methods  developed  here  will be able to address an entire  hierarchy  of  hypotheses    regarding   the   relationship   between    genetic  variance-covariance matrices from two or more  populations.  Once  these hypotheses are addressed, the net pattern of selection that  led to the divergence of the two populations can be reconstructed  and tested.    In  all,  a  coherent  set  of methods  and  procedures  will  be  developed  that will free those doing quantitative genetics  from  the  tedium  of analysis and allow them to pursue  many  new  and  exciting avenues of research.",
