 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600133  Brenner       In the application of finite element methods to problems in  computational mechanics, difficulties such as the phenomenon of  locking, the incompressibility constraint, cracked domains and  higher order equations are encountered.  By combining the  techniques of nonconforming elements, macro elements, singular  functions and mixed formulations, robust finite element methods  that employ relatively few numbers of unknowns can be developed  to overcome these difficulties.  The  investigator develops  multigrid and domain decomposition algorithms for such finite  element methods.       Multigrid algorithms compute the solutions of systems of  equations at a cost proportional to the number of unknowns and  therefore are the most efficient methods for solving large  systems.  Domain decomposition algorithms distribute the  computation over different parts of the physical domain and hence  are very suitable for parallel computers.  They are currently two  of the major ideas in high performance computing.  The results  from this project can lead to fast solvers for problems in  elasticity, plasticity, plates, beams, shells, and fluid  mechanics.  In particular, a new multigrid method is developed for  the computation of stress intensity factors, which are important  quantities in the study of the macroscopic phenomena of materials  such as fatigues and fractures.  These problems arise in the  design of structures such as buildings, bridges, planes, and  ships, and in the analysis of how structures perform.  Hence the  project provides tools for solving problems of manufacturing and  of monitoring and renewing civil infrastructure.",
