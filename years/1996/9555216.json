 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science education faces a number of problems today: separating science into discrete disciplines; mixing majors and  non-majors in the same courses; creating an adversarial, competitive climate which repels minority, female, and  learning disabled students; ignoring the need for special science preparation for elementary education majors; failing  to teach science skills and processes directly; and passive lecture/demonstration teaching without students  experiencing much \"real\" science.  The Natural World: Explorations in Science--an introductory, integrated science  course for non-science and elementary education majors is laboratory-based and experientaly driven.  It is designed  around four major concepts matter and energy, change and constancy, diversity and order, and interactions with  the following goals:  To provide broad, integrated science knowledge  To foster the development of effective  process learning skills in science  To prepare future elementary teachers  * To create a continuing interest in science  Methods include extensive writing, concept mapping, guided discovery laboratory experiences, reading in the history  of science and popular journals, collaborative teams, library/Internet research, quantifying, computer modeling,  problem solving, and critical thinking skills.  Collaborations include teaming physics, chemistry, and biology faculty  and a writing specialist to create the course with university science education faculty for project evaluation.  The  integrated course may serve as a model for introductory science courses at similar small colleges and teacher  preparation institutions.  Researchers plan to write articles, make presentations, and collaborate on producing the  guided discovery materials for publication.",
