 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS 9626266  Mykland    The project seeks to extend the use of likelihood methods to  semi- and nonparametric situations.  Important questions include  how to define and assess the accuracy of the likelihood ratio and  R-star statistics.  Of particular interest so far has been the  development of the dual likelihood, of Bartlett identities for  martingales, and of embedding techniques which permit the  derivation of asymptotic expansions for martingales.  Currently,  the investigators are expanding the theory to cover  non-martingale situations, by considering criterion functions  which are approximately likelihoods.  This covers a much broader  spectrum of data analysis problems.  It is desirable to describe  what types of inference can be covered by this, and what  corrections over likelihood inference that ought to be used when  carrying out procedures based on this approach.  The study  concerns both existing procedures (such as empirical and point  process \"likelihoods\"), and at new constructions which arise from  the artificial likelihood point of view.  In particular, the  \"design-your-own likelihood\" is being investigated, with  particular reference to resampling based criterion functions.   The implications for problems in financial engineering and  investment under uncertainty are being studied as part of the  project.  Policy makers in both business and goverment are faced  with the need to take decisions under uncertainty.  Firms invest  in new plants, for instance, with imperfect knowledge of current  and future market conditions for their products.  Regulations  concerning the environment, as another example, often try to  affect systems that are so complex that even with the best models  and scientific studies, there is tremendous uncertainty about the  effects of one's actions.  Decisions in such circumstances not  only require estimates and predictions, but also a maximally  accurate quantification of how far away such estimates are likely  to be from the actual figures.  This  project is about a new  technology for doing this, one that substantially improves the  reliability of such assessments.  It is based on a statistical  theory (\"likelihood inference\") first developed in Britain in the  1920s, but which has only in the last few years been opened up to  the more complex and vaguely specified systems often faced by  policy makers.",
