 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612422  Sandoval    Established in 1982, the NM MESA currently serves approximately  2,500 students in 7 middle and high schools throughout the state,  with 85% of the participants being underrepresented minorities and  59% being female. Mentoring is a critical component of the MESA  success, which also includes:      I.   Weekly contact with advisors/teachers, tutoring, academic       counseling, curriculum based enrichment activities, leadership       workshops, field trips, summer enrichment classes, career       awareness speakers, scholarship opportunities, and academic       competitions;      II.  A continual support system that increases students  chances       for success in higher education, because they have developed       study, research and cooperative learning skills;      III. Over the last three years, 88% of NM MESA graduating seniors       enrolling in two or four-year institutions and 71% of those       having chosen mathematics, science, or engineering related       majors;      IV.  Significant MESA impact upon the course offerings and       enrollment for participating schools -- e.g. increase in the       number of minorities enrolled in college intended mathematics       and science course sequences; and      V.   Steady growth in the number of schools and school districts       that have chosen to participate; school districts must       contribute their own resources in this model of shared       responsibility for financial and academic support;  the NM       State Legislature has provided a steady growth in funding over       the past years.",
