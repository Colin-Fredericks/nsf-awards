 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description of Instrumentation: Evangel College requests $210,884  from the National Science Foundation for the acquisition of a  system of analytical instruments to be used in environmental  research. This proposal addresses equipment requirements in the  environmental research program, which is a collaboration between  biology, chemistry, and environmental science faculty in the  Science and Technology Department. The project will be directed  by Dr. Turner Collins, Professor of Biology. He will be assisted  by Mr. Michael Tenneson and Dr. Michael McCorcle. The  environmental teaching and research experience of this will bring  a multidisciplinary approach to this project. This acquisition  will make possible a wide array of research training  opportunities for the Evangel College science student.    The  request is for a system of analytical instruments which will  be  networked  into  a Laboratory Information  Management  System  (LIMS). The system consists of three analytical instruments along  with  computer  hardware and software. Each  of  these  precision  instruments  integrates  with  a  networked  version  of  a  LIMS  software package. Evangel College already has installed a  campus  network;  the  equipment represented by  this  proposal  will  be  attached  to  the existing network. When the complete  system  is  operational,  students  will analyze samples  in  the  instrument  room,  store the results on the LIMS database, and retrieve  data  for lab reports from any computer on the network.    Research  and  Research  Training: Successful  research  training  requires   a  capable  faculty,  energetic  and  gifted   science  students,  and technological tools in step with today's  research  profession. Evangel College possesses a capable faculty with both  research  and  research training experience.  Many  of  Evangel's  graduates  have  gone on to receive higher  degrees.  Of  the  22  private colleges and universities in Missouri, Evangel ranks  6th  in  the production of st udents who eventually receive Ph.D's.  In  addition,  Evangel has produced more teachers than any  of  these  other   Missouri  institutions.  While  Evangel's   Science   and  Technology  department has had some initial  success  in  forming  research  training,  the  technological components  required  for  state-of-the-art research training experiences do not yet exist.    To  date,  scientific research and research training  at  Evangel  have  capitalized  on  regional environmental  issues  and  local  cooperative  alliances.  The  school  is  located  in  the  Ozark  Mountains,   a   recreational  region  with  great  environmental  concerns.  Evangel  College faculty and student  researchers  are  conducting environmental studies of the region's water  supplies.  In this process, cooperative arrangements exist with the Missouri  Department  of Conservation, the Missouri Department  of  Natural  Resources, and the City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri.    Activities Resulting from Funding: The current research  projects  have  been short term projects which have been severely  hindered  by  the  lack  of  modern and sophisticated instrumentation.  The  instrumentation from this proposal will permit the  modernization  of the Evangel College research labs, will permit the students to  participate in a meaningful long-term research project, and  will  contribute valuable information to the city and state agencies.",
