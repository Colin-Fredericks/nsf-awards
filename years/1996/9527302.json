This research is felt to be particularly important in light of  concerns with the quality of the nation's civil infrastructure  system.  In terms of overall power system reliability and security,  individual equipment condition plays a critical role.  Electric  utilities direct significant effort towards detecting accelerated  aging and preventing catastrophic equipment failures.   Traditional maintenance and condition monitoring schedules were  based primarily on manufacturer recommended fixed time intervals.   In recent years due to greater economic pressures, utilities have  begun, one, to shift towards longer maintenance intervals and  two, to load equipment significantly beyond manufacturer ratings.   Under normal conditions, there is adequate design margin to allow  both reduced maintenance and some overloading.  Recent sensor  developments offer the ability to further stretch equipment  limits by monitoring certain key variables.  Unfortunately, the  breakdown mechanism of most equipment are only partially  understood so that developed methods for early detection of  equipment failures are imprecise and unreliable. Broad experience  with a particular technique is necessary to overcome this  impression and perform effective diagnosis.  In addition, most  equipment has relatively long expected lifetimes so that there may  not be significant failure date to perform meaningful statistical  models of failures.  Together the above factors, suggest that utilities are following  practices with limited knowledge of the long term impacts on  system reliability.  They may not fully understand the limits to  which their equipment can be pushed. Further, they lack the  computational framework to include their data and the experience  in a workable model.  This work focuses on developing an  info rmation theoretic framework for modeling the imperfect  knowledge of equipment breakdown with the ability to easily  incorporate new information as experience is gained.  The long  term objective is to allow both statistical, process and  heuristic data in a model which allows for improved suggestions  on maintenance intervals, diagnostic conclusions and reliability  evaluation.  This project will focus on underlying general  principles of power system equipment in developing this model.   ***",
