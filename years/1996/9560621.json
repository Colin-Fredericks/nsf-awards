 "awd_abstract_narration": "9560621  Armstrong     It is challenging to enable students to collect accurate, valid data without sacrificing the educational aspects of the program.  This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project addresses this fundamental difficulty encountered by a number of groups that desire to have networked students collect data which are appropriate for use by scientists.  An example of such desired measurement capability by networked students is the pH, dissolved oxygen, and temperature in a river from its head waters to its outlet as an indication of the river's environmental condition.  ADA Technologies proposes to address this issue of data accuracy and validation by using a unique set of hardware currently under development by ADA along with unique software algorithms to be developed in this project.  The hardware includes a low-cost, hand-held, four-channel data logger with a set of self-identifying sensor modules.  The unique calibration and data tagging aspects of this system provide an opportunity for data tracking that does not exist for any other product.  All this information will be processed using innovative software algorithms which will perform a number of internal consistency tests to validate the data.  These checks will be part of an education organizational model that will help students learn critical thinking skills and can be replicated in all the network programs.  This model will link students with scientists and promote direct interaction focused around a specific scientific goal.  The aim of this program is to develop an organizational model combined with unique hardware and software that can aid networks in gathering scientifically valid data while insuring an educationally significant experience for the students.   This project offers an innovative approach for improving the scientific skills of students and for helping to promote the use of scientific tools in education.  It will enable students to gain critical thinking skills and to engage in active communicatio n with scientists.  .A market for innovative curricula and advanced educational materials will be created as a result of the research to be conducted during the proposed program.  The successful implementation of the described system will be of great benefit to a wide range of scientific programs in the United States and will supply innovative tools for conducting research",
