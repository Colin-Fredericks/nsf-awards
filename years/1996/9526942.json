 "awd_abstract_narration": "Imagining an event and watching it unfold in the mind's eye is a common experience of most people.  It has often been proposed that this is one basis for thinking about events and predicting their outcomes, and that thereby it is an important method of reasoning, planning, communicating, and understanding.  This research attempts to place such imagistic reasoning on a firm theoretical footing by characterizing it as precisely defined computations performed on mental representations.  The research focuses on the use of diagrams as a vehicle for reasoning about spatial relations and mathematical concepts that can be understood by spatial analogies.  Spatial reasoning and diagram interpretation are important abilities of humans, and machines with similar abilities have advantages over machines without them, including a more natural mode of interaction with people.  The goal of this research is a better scientific understanding of human cognitive psychology, and the basis of a technology for machines that can think directly in images.  Potential applications of spatial reasoning programs and theory include automated navigation systems, improved computer-human interfaces, improved methods for clearly presenting scientific data and control panel information, methods of diagnosing faults in machines, and improved methods of technical instruction.",
