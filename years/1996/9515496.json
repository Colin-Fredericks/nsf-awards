 "awd_abstract_narration": "INT 9515496  Rovner      This U.S.-Hungary cooperative project between Dr. Irwin Rovner of North Carolina State University and Dr. Ferenc Gyulai of the Hungarian Institute of Archaeology will lay groundwork for an atuomated, morphometric seed atlas featuring seeds of Europe.  The primary quantitative parameters of morphometry employed by the researchers will include measurements of several shape factors, topographical features, and size measurement. The intent is to produce a reference with greater precision than available in conventional sources.  This morphometric analysis of European seed populations will employ an interactive, computer assisted image analysis system which possesses capabilities for classification and identification.    Initial efforts for the atlas will draw upon a major seed reference collection from the Hungarian Museum of Agriculture that represents between 15,000 and 20,000 taxa.  The collection includes modern seed populations as well as many archaeological seed collections derived from sites encompassing a seven-to-eight thousand year sequence from Neolithic through Medieval periods.  These Hungarian collections will be transferred for computer image analysis to North Carolina State University where additional controlled studies of factors affecting seed morphology will be conducted.  In addition to the benefit of access to an automated reference for the extensive European collection, results are expected to produce a reference tool that may be broadly used for seed identification and analysis in many areas of basic research as well as environmental and commercial applications.    This project in systematic plant biology fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.          ??",
