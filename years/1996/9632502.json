 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this research is to develop and synthesize information on the design, construction and inelastic behavior of composite frame buildings that will lead to their broader acceptance and utilization in the U.S., particularly in seismic regions.  In spite of some notable applications for tall buildings, wider use of composite RCS frame construction is hindered by the lack of comprehensive design criteria and construction methodologies.  Widespread use of composite RCS frames in the U.S. will require development of construction schemes that may differ from those previously used for high-rise construction.  The research has three interrelated composites:    Prototype Composite System Designs:  Several prototype buildings will be designed using available information (connection test data and design guidelines) from the US and Japan.  The goal of this exercise will be to develop innovative designs using precast  and/or prefabricated composite subassemblies that facilitate construction and provide required toughness and difficulty for seismic applications.  Inelastic Seismic Behavior and Response:  The seismic behavior of the prototype building designs will be evaluated and compared to conventional steel and reinforced concrete systems through detailed inelastic static and transient structural analyses.  These studies will include parametric studies of building response to assess and improve seismic design criteria in existing specifications for earthquake response modification factors, inelastic drift and stability limits, ductility demands, etc.  Design Criteria for Composite Frames and Connections:  A critical review of existing design provisions in the U.S. and Japan will be conducted to see where improvements can be made based on the latest research data related to composite RCS frames and connections.  This will include development of a state-of-the art report to summarize extensive test data, design criteria, and construction practice for RCS frames in Japan, much of which is only written in Japanese and is currently inaccessible to U.S. engineers and researchers.",
