 "awd_abstract_narration": "The acquisition of a capillary electrophoresis (CE) system enables analyses of dissolved inorganic and organic anions in natural water samples. Dissolved anions are analyzed routinely to assess water quality, supplementing the analysis of dissolved cations by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) methods. These data are fundamental to an understanding of natural water compositions in the context of geochemical processes including water-rock interactions, contaminant migration, and carbon cycling.   Analysis of dissolved anions in water is commonly accomplished using ion-exchange chromatography. However, recent application of CE methods to water samples presents many advantages over ion-exchange methods, especially in an academic setting. CE systems have fewer moving parts, less expensive columns, smaller solvent waste volumes, and faster analyses.   Upper-level undergraduate geology majors in the Introduction to Geochemistry course are being instructed in the concepts of aqueous geochemistry (for example, equilibrium, activity and concentration relationships, and mineral solubility). These concepts can be applied in order to understand the processes governing natural (and possibly contaminated) ground and surface water samples. Students proceed through a six-part exercise in which they perform the following tasks:  collect water samples in the field; prepare water samples for analysis; analyze samples for anions by CE; analyze samples for dissolved cations by ICP-AES; perform qualitative interpretation of water-quality data by graphical methods; and perform quantitative interpretations of water-quality data by computer models.   In addition to providing interdisciplinary educational and research opportunities at the undergraduate level, acquisition of a CE enhances the department's ability to develop undergraduate laboratory exercises focusing on water-quality analysis.",
