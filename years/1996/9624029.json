The work will involve far  infrared  (FIR)  magneto-spectroscopy and  near  infrared/visible optical  experiments  carried    out   using   a  unique   diamondanvil   apparatus    that  achieves  in-situ  tuning of pressure, temperature and magnetic field  over  the  ranges 0150 kbar, 2300K  and  0-17T.  The  approach   will  permit  direct  comparison  of spectroscopic results recorded over  a  wide  range of energies from  the FIR  to  the  visible on  the  same  samples  under  the  same  conditions, which has not heretofore  been  possible.  Such studies should yield  (1) a much  clearer picture  of  the   competition  between  shallow  and   deep  (both   stable   and  metastable)  impurity states in semiconductors  for  many   different  substitutional  species,  (2)  should  help  establish   the  carrier  density   dependence of many-body effects in  doped   aluminumgallium  arsenide/gallium-arsenide quantum  well  structures,  and (3)  should  enable   the   exploration   of   conditions   and  properties    for  possible stable excitonic ground states in indium-arsenide/aluminium-  gallium-antimony systems.  %%%  The  program investigates the effect of high hydrostatic pressure  on  the  energy and competition of shallow (hydrogenic) and deep impurity  states  in III-V semiconductors and hererostructures, as well  as  on  the possible occurrence and properties of stable excitonic states  in  these  systems.

The  approach  will  permit  direct  comparison  of  spectroscopic results recorded over a wide  range  of  energies from te far-infra-red to the visible.
