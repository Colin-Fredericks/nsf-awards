Primarily transient   wave propagation problems will be considered, although many of the   techniques will also be applicable in the frequency domain. The boundary   conditions are based on first deriving convergent or asymptotic expansions   of the solution valid in the far field and then constructing differential   operators which annihilate the leading order terms in the expansions.    Generally these operators require specification of an origin from which   outgoing waves are assumed to emanate.  Techniques will be developed in   which interior information is used to improve the performance of the   boundary condition.  In particular, adaptive boundary conditions will be   developed in which the origin is estimated dynamically and locally from   properties of the solution in the interior.  Techniques to increase the order of   the boundary condition without increasing the order of the differential   operator will also be developed.  This will be done by incorporating   inhomogeneous terms into the boundary operator, again using properties of   the computed solution in the interior.  Finally, far field expansions and   associated boundary conditions suitable for damping layers will be   developed, thereby allowing a reduction in size of the layers.    The numerical computation of waves, for example, acoustic and    electromagnetic waves, will be considered.  These problems are typically   governed by equations specified in regions which are unbounded in at least   one direction. In order for the problem to be formulated on a computer it is   necessary that the unbounded region be replaced by a bounded region.    Furthermore, it is necessary that some boundary condition be imposed at the   edge (boundary) of the bounded region.  This boundary condition should   ideally simulate the ori ginal unbounded problem.  However, in general the   boundary treatment will not be a perfect simulation of the unbounded   problem and there will be spurious reflections emanating from the   boundary.  These reflections will propagate into the interior region and   seriously degrade the accuracy of the computed solution.  Thus, it is   essential for accurate computation that these spurious reflections be   minimized.  Boundary conditions will be considered based on properties of   the waves in the far field, i.e., far from the sources where the waves are   generated.  Currently for any given computation the boundary conditions   are generally determined in advance, i.e., at the beginning of the   computation, and are not changed as the solution evolves in time.  Thus,    the boundary conditions make no use of information about the waves in the   interior. Methodologies will be developed in which interior information can   be used to improve the performance of the boundary conditions.  In this   approach, the boundary conditions will change as time evolves, adapting to   the nature of the solution by making use of interior information.  It is   anticipated that the resulting boundary treatment will allow a significant   reduction in spurious reflections.  Thus, the proposed new boundary   conditions offer the prospect of significant improvement in efficiency and   accuracy for the computation of wave propagation problems.  Applications   to acoustic, electromagnetic and elastic wave propagation will be   considered.",
