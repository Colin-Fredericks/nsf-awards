 "awd_abstract_narration": "The CSUF Undergraduate Reform Initiative will address infrastructure issues relating to the academic needs of three undergraduate populations at California State University, Fullerton: lower- division majors in science, mathematics and engineering (SME); upper-division SME majors; and students not majoring in those fields. Specifically, it will address the need to retain greater numbers of lower-division majors in science and engineering; to produce more scientifically literate graduates from all majors and to give future teachers more confidence in science and mathematics; and to provide graduates the skills they need for successful careers. The initiative focuses on three areas: foundation courses, general education and teacher preparation, and interdisciplinary enhancements for majors. Three interdisciplinary faculty teams will lead the initiative, participating in retreats and meeting during the academic year to plan and pilot specific curricula and projects. The foundation courses team will explore ways to teach mathematics so it is more relevant to science and engineering, to introduce technology-based instruction into the classroom; and to improve academic advisement. The general education and teacher preparation team will explore the feasibility of an integrated lower-division communication course tailored to the needs of SME majors and examine ways to align science and mathematics content with national standards and to encourage SME majors to consider teaching careers. The interdisciplinary enhancements team will explore ways for SME majors to study business and communication and will expand opportunities for experiential learning. The initiative will create an infrastructure designed to produce students who are more literate in science, mathematics and technology and better-prepared for their careers and their responsibilities as citizens. It will direct the university away from rigid, discipline-driven departmentalization and toward a more seamless curriculum. Finally, it will help transform the campus culture, helping faculty to become more receptive to change and to embrace connections with other disciplines.",
