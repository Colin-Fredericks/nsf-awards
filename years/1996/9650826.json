 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides funds for the purchase of a Fourier-transform-infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer to be used for undergraduate teaching and research.   This project is the initial phase of a multiphase plan for improving the instrumentation available at the university. The ultimate goals are to provide an improved laboratory experience for the students, to increase their skill level, and to attract more students to major in chemistry. The target audience is students enrolled in the organic, inorganic, and biochemistry laboratory courses, which, in addition to chemistry majors, include students in the biological sciences and prenursing curricula. At present, only chemistry majors get actual hands-on experience with the major instrumentation. This project also increases the training available to the chemistry majors and gives all the students better exposure to state-of-the-art chemical instrumentation.   The plan is to give as many students as possible (approximately 400 per year) experience with FTIR. Advanced sampling techniques, such as horizontal attenuated total reflectance and diffuse reflectance, are fully utilized. Experiments are designed to allow the atmosphere in the teaching laboratory to mimic an actual research setting. While IR spectroscopy typically has been associated with the assignment and identification of organic functional groups, this project shows it can be equally effective as a pedagogic tool in the undergraduate inorganic and biochemistry curricula.   Experiments developed in this project can be published in an appropriate journal such as the Journal of Chemical Education. This can be complemented with student presentations at regional and national meetings. Thus, the use of FTIR is beneficial not only to these students but to the entire undergraduate community nationwide.",
