 "awd_abstract_narration": "9529138  Kotliar  This grant concerns those properties of a Fermi system that  are not present in the weakly interacting-clean substances  but that arise as a result of the strong interparticle  interaction and/or lack of translational invariance.  These  properties are present in experiments on metal-insulator  transitions.  They are also critical to our understanding of  heavy fermions, doped semiconductors, amorphous alloys and  high temperature superconductors.  Specifically, the project  consists of three parts (a) Mott transition in orbitally  degenerate systems, (b) a large dimension analysis of the  interplay between localization and interaction and (c)  Effect of quantum fluctuations in the melting of a vortex  lattice.  %%%  Typically, magnets are insulating (Iron Cobalt and Nickel  are very subtle exceptions) and superconductors are good  metals at high temperatures (when they are not  superconducting).   Recent discoveries of high temperature  superconductors show these materials to belong to a special  class, where the normal state of a superconductor is not a  very good metal and there is magnetism in similar compounds.  The puzzling coexistence of magnetism and dirty metallic  character and superconductivity is a complex and challenging  theoretical problem.  The present grant suggests a novel  approach to the solution of this problem and possible  understanding of the phenomena of  high temperature  superconductivity.  ***",
