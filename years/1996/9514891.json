The objective of the workshop is to initiate a  long-term cooperative project in science education and  research in alternative power sources between the two  universities.  The proposed project will team photovoltaics  (PV's) specialists from ISU Microelectronics Research Center  with Dr. Escobar's group in El Salvador.   ISU has a group  of scientists working both on the research and pilot  production of photovoltaic devices.  Dr. Escobar has already  established an active program in the development of  alternative energy sources for community development in El  Salvador.  Photovoltaics researchers from Mexico and Costa  Rica will also participate in this workshop.    The extension of research and technology in terrestrial PV's  to third world countries is important if the technology is  to make it into the market place, since emerging countries  are likely to be its earliest users.  This planning workshop  will serve to bring together experts from the region to  promote collaboration on photovoltaic devices, which may  lead to the development of more efficient alternative energy  sources.    ***",
