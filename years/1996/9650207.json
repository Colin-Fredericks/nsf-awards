 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the implementation of a biology teaching laboratory computer network that places 32 computers among four teaching laboratories, all connected to an existing departmental local area network for common access to data and programs. A graphic Internet browser is also being provided. A biology teaching laboratories network provides opportunities for students to acquire and analyze data as they perform experiments, to gain experience with instrument interfacing and statistical analysis using computers, and to learn how to present data and multimedia presentations for use in science and teaching careers.   Internet connection of the network also gives students access to the wealth of programs and teaching resources available on the World Wide Web, interaction with graphics and informational databases, and access to model data that can be manipulated in the context of laboratory experiments.   The network system is being used in the laboratories for two, full-year freshman biology sequences that are taken by all of the majors at the college. Several upper-class courses, including Basics of Microbiology I and II, Applied Microbiology, Virology, Plant Tissue Culture, Hematology, Ecology, Genetics, Cell Biology, and Directed Research can also use the networked computers. These courses are taken by biology, microbiology, and medical technology majors and elected by students in other majors. In addition, the network system can be used in courses that serve the biology science teacher certification program. This system positively influences the learning environment of approximately 515 students each year in laboratory courses and another 5 to 10 engaged in undergraduate research.   The system greatly enhances the teaching environment offered at the college by providing opportunities to meet the individual student needs in each of the curricula served. The network system also serves to prepare biologists and science teachers to use computers in learning, teaching, and research.",
