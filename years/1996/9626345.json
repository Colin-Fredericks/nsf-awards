The  purpose of this meeting is to clarify the questions and tradeoffs  involved in evaluating knowledge-based software designed to  assist decision-makers in contexts involving human health and  welfare.  These principles will have applications to all  knowledge-based  systems, but the acuteness of the need is most  apparent in deployments that directly involve human life.  Knowledge-based systems are complex pieces of software, so  empirical studies are necessary to predict their performance. The  workshop will bring together many persons who have undertaken  systematic evaluations of such systems to share their knowledge  and develop principled approaches to such evaluation.",
