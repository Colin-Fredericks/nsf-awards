 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seismic rehabilitation of existing buildings has been a significant area of research during the last decade. However, very little guidance exists for the evaluation of existing buildings and, other than case studies or qualitative descriptions, there are no specific recommendations for the design of retrofits.  To this end, the research under this program will focus on the seismic evaluation and retrofit existing buildings, in particular reinforced concrete frames.  The main objective of this research project is to evaluate current methodologies for the evaluation of existing reinforced concrete frames and to develop alternate procedures for the evaluation and design of retrofits.  This objective will be accomplished by conducting analytical studies of selected reinforced concrete frame buildings representative of existing construction in regions of low-to-moderate and high seismic risk.  The results of the analysis will be compared with measured response when possible and will be correlated with current procedures for the evaluation of buildings.  Based on these results, modifications to existing procedures will be proposed and alternate methodologies will be developed.  The investigation will have a direct impact on the effort sponsored by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to prepare Guidelines for the Seismic Rehabilitation of Buildings (ATC-33).  The research undertaken will be combined with an education component which focus as on the development of a program in infrastructure rehabilitation cover issues broader than the seismic rehabilitation alone.  Also, a program on new materials for civil engineering applications being developed.  These programs will be implemented through research, development of new courses, and outreach and extracurricular activities involving the participation of both undergraduate and graduate students.  This is a FY 96 Career award.",
