 "awd_abstract_narration": "9628202  Crick   Are developing a new method for high-resolution cyclocorrelation and cyclochronology based on a combination of biostratigraphic control and quick, easily performed magnetic measurements.  We are calling the method magnetosusceptibility stratigraphy (MSS).  The high resolution of Mss is derived from high-frequency events under the control of orbital forcing cycles with current frequencies of the Milankovitch band (19-23, 41, 54, 100, 413 ka).  The preliminary data used to document the proposal are from a number of Devonian marine sequences:  Morocco, an area chosen because it contains outstanding outcrop exposures, excellent biostratigraphic control, and the Eifelian/Givetian GSSP; Europe, two internationally recognized Devonian sequences in the Montagne Noire, southern France (including the Frasnian/Famennian GSSP); and the Frasnian-Tournaisian of southern Oklahoma.  The proposed work will allow use to demonstrate that (1) MSS works, (2) it can provide correlations at better than the best biozone resolution within basins, among basins, and between regions, (3) trends inherent to the MSS curves are evidence of transgressive/regressive or deepening/shallowing sequences, (4) with close sampling MSS proxies for orbital forcing cycles, and (5) once calibrated for the geologic time of interest, the duration of orbital forcing cycles identified from long and reasonably complete stratigraphic sections can be used to establish or construct \"floating\" orbital forcing timescales.   While the recognition that orbital cycles can be traced by the record left in sediments is an important contribution, even more important is the duration of cycles important in the creation of \"floating\" orbital forcing timescales.  These timescales, based on the recognition of the several orbital forcing cycles but not referenced to a curve anchored in the Holocene, will serve to further our understanding of the forces of evolution and sedimentation and to fix the duration of biostratigraphic zones within the l ess precise framework of radiometric time.  Such cyclochronologies must eventually lead to a coherent geochronology with increased resolution of at least one order of magnitude over that presently in use.",
