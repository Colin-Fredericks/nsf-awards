Group theory usually appears as part of a course in  abstract algebra, and the main groups considered are finite groups.  On the other hand, the main groups which affect our lives and the  structure of the universe are continuous groups (Lie groups). This  project begins to remedy this situation by creating a course which  exhibits the unifying nature of continuous symmetry. The course  will begin by discussing symmetries which are directly related to  concepts of physical space: dilations, rigid motions, similarities.  It will then introduce the basic concepts of linear algebra, and  discuss geometric issues in 2, 3 and 4 dimensions, culminating in  the special theory of relativity. Examples and applications will be  emphasized throughout. The course will emphasize interactive  teaching, and will include extended projects with possibilities for  group activities. An important project component will involve  working with PIMMS, the leading mathematics and science education  effort in the State of Connecticut. Through this effort the project  will impact the pre-service teacher population. A text is planned  along with computer laboratory materials. The overall goal of this  work is to put students in touch with a major direction of  intellectual advance in mathematics over the past century, and to  take the ideas of mathematics education reform f urther into the  undergraduate curriculum. In particular, the proposed course will  be an attractive alternative to the usual sophomore-level linear  algebra course.",
