 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Workshop Physical Science Project is a major effort to  increase the effectiveness of science education for our  future K-8 teachers, parents, and citizens by developing a  sequence of introductory laboratory courses in physical  science.  We seek to integrate guided inquiry with student-  directed projects in order to help students acquire a better  understanding of what practicing scientists actually do.  This hands-on approach is aimed at changing the focus of  introductory science courses from covering a large number of  topics-which promotes memorizing facts and formulae- to  helping students develop science process skills that will  give them the confidence to undertake future investigations  independently.  A modular design of the curricular materials  will provide ample flexibility for instructors at other  colleges and universities to adapt the program to their own  environments.  These materials will be developed for use  in  teacher preparation programs, general studies courses for  non-science majors, and courses designed to inspire  freshmen and sophomores to pursue science as a major.  This  proposed four-year project began in September 1994  under a  three-year grant from the Charles A. Dana Foundation, with  the expectation that additional funds would be  solicited  for its completion.  We are asking FIPSE to underwrite  approximately half of the costs for project years two  and  three, and all of the costs for year four.  This will allow  us to create and evaluate cutticular materials for a two-  semester course sequence and to complete a two-year pilot  test of the materials at three different institutions,  Dickinson College, the University of Nebraska, and Moorhead  State University in Minnesota.  In addition, a portion  of  the funds will be used to initiate an active dissemination  program in the fourth year of the project involving talks,  articles, and workshops, as well as consultations with  several institutions interested in using the materials.",
