 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625793  Vesilind    This is an award to support research, the objective of which is  to obtain a better understanding than now exists of factors that  affect thickening and dewatering of suspensions of biologically  active solids.  The investigator's initial objective is to  synthesize a suspension using polystyrene latex particles to  simulate bacteria, alginate to simulate microbial extracellular  polymers, calcium as source of potential bridging cations, and as  yet unknown component to simulate flocculation.    Research on biologically active suspensions of solids has been  hampered by their variability.  Results of this research aimed at  developing a synthetic equivalent of these suspension has the  potential of significantly improving our understanding of their  behavior when subjected to sedimentation and dewatering.  This  improved understanding in turn has the potential for improving  the engineering design of new bioreactors processing systems for  treatment of domestic and industrial wastewaters and in operation  of existing systems.",
