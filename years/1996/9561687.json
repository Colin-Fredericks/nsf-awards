 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop a polarization independent wavelength routing switch for wideband fiber optic communication. The enormous potential of all-optical network for wide area telecommunication has stimulated considerable research on the supporting optical device technologies. At the core of the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) based optical network is a crossconnect switch for routing a larger number of wavelength channels. The acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) has shown to be the most promising candidate for the wavelength routing switch due to its unique capability of routing many wavelengths simultaneously and independently. Present technology of this key device, however, has basic performance limitations that include limited resolution, unacceptable crosstalk and high insertion loss. Aurora Associates proposes a new type of polarization independent (PI) AOTF. The novel concept adds greater flexibility in the selection of materials and device design and offers the potential of overcoming all of the deficiencies of present AOTF technology. During Phase I, a feasibility model will be built to prove the principle of the new PI AOTF and show its potential for WDM switch applications. Projected key performance of the feasibility model PI AOTF include 1 nm bandwidth at 1550 nm and sidelobes below -30 dB.       The new AOTF described in this proposal can be used in a wide range of commercial applications: multiplexing fiber optic sensor, tuning of laser, fiber optic spectrometer, and most importantly, the WDM cross-connect switch - the key device in an all-optical networks for wide area telecommunication.",
