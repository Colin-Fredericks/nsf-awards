 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a group proposal to purchase a scanning laser confocal  fluorescence microscope. The microscope will be the centerpiece of a  new Shared Facility for Fluorescence Microscopy which will serve as the  focus of the investigators' research projects and as the key element in  a new laboratory course for undergraduates.    Each of the six investigators studies aspects of the cytoskeleton in a  developing system, focussing on the elucidation of cytoarchitectural  remodeling and the organization of motile organelles. The goal of all  of the projects is to utilize high resolution fluorescence microscopy  to determine how the cytoskeletal components organize and re-organize  during development. Because of the complexity, thickness, and optical  opacity of the experimental systems used by the investigators (plant  cells, sea urchin eggs and embryos, Drosophila embryos, leech nervous  system ciliated protozoans), conventional immunofluorescence is often  of insufficient quality for the studies. The problem is solved by the  application of confocal fluorescence microscopy; this is clearly  demonstrated in the preliminary confocal microscopy work by the  investigators. Unfortunately, the existing instruments, located in  other departments and which might be used for these studies, are  heavily oversubscribed and costly. Thus, although the investigators are  asking fascinating questions in excellent model systems and with highly  specific tools, they are severely limited by a lack of equipment. The  group of investigators is of the ideal size to share a microscope. And  the microscope will prove to be a natural stimulus for the continued  close interactions among these research groups.    A second important feature of the proposal is that the confocal  microscope will be utilized in the education and training of many  students. Currently, among the six laboratories, there are 18 graduate  students and 17 undergraduate students; these 35 students include 14  women, 4 African Americans, and 4 Asian Ameri cans. The projects  described here will be performed by these students, and they will  therefore be able to work directly with state-of-the-art equipment. A  second exciting way the equipment will be utilized is as the  centerpiece in a new undergraduate laboratory course, taught by the six  investigators. The course will enable undergraduates to design,  implement, and discuss mini-projects focussed on the cytoskeleton in  developing systems using conventional and confocal immunofluorescence  microscopy.",
