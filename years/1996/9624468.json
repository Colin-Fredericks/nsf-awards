In these materials, the low temperature behavior  is  dominated by the interactions between the electrons. A  number  of  advanced   instrumentation  and  techniques   such   as   ultrasonics,  superconducting  quantum  interference devices  as  well  as  scanning  magnetometry,   and   transport  measurements  will   be   used.   The  measurements will be performed on high quality single crystals as well  as  on  thin  film samples. Extreme physical conditions such  as  high  uniaxial  pressures,  high magnetic fields and very  low  temperatures  will  be  chosen  as  appropriate to elucidate the  unique  nature  of  superconductivity and magnetism in these materials. For this purpose a  special low temperature apparatus where uniaxial pressure up to  8,000  atmosphere and magnetic fields close to a million times stronger  than  the  earth's  magnetic filed, will be utilized. The  results  obtained  will  be  relevant to many areas in materials science  including  high  temperature  superconductivity, magnetic storage, high field  magnetic  materials etc.  %%%  The  superconducting and magnetic phases of rare  earth  and  actinide  based intermetallic heavy fermion compounds will be investigated  with  ultrasonics, force as well as SQUID magnetometry (both macroscopic and  microscopic)  and transport measurements. These measurements  will  be  performed  on  high quality single crystals as well as  on  thin  film  samples.   A  combination  of  experiments  involving  high   uniaxial  pressures,  high  magnetic fields and ultra-low temperatures  will  be  chosen  as  appropriate  to  elucidate the novel  superconducting  and  magnetic  phenomena  in these materials. These phenomena  include  (i)  coexistence  of superconductivity and magnetism, (ii) multiple  order  parameters in the superconducting state, (i ii) magnetic filed vortices  with half a quantum of circulation, (iv) magnetism with non-Neel types  of  order,  and (v) novel magnetic and transport effects  due  to  the  presence of interfaces. The measurements will utilize a special ultra  low   temperature  apparatus  where  the  magnitude  and  the   mutual  orientations  of externally applied perturbations, uniaxial  pressures  upto  8 kbar and magnetic fields upto 16 tesla, can be controlled  in  situ.  ***",
