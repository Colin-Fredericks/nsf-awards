 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nationally, students typically do not improve in conceptual understanding of basic physics principles under traditional instructional techniques. The primary goal of this project is to provide a means for students to improve their learning, retention, and utilization of physics concepts and principles. This goal is being accomplished through the use of computers and microcomputer-based laboratories. These laboratories (from Tools for Scientific Thinking, Workshop Physics, and others that are being prepared in-house) in kinematics, forces, rotational motion, energy, heat, and light use probes and other accessories connected to the computers to gather data. The students can then analyze this data and, through discovery, learn and internalize physics concepts. The new approach results in new learning experiences for the students and, according to data gathered by Thornton and Laws, improve conceptual understanding.   The laboratories are being equipped with the software and hardware for three complete workstations and one portable computer. These items can be used to supplement the current laboratory, which has three Power Macintosh 7100/72 computers and the accessory probes and interfaces. Other new equipment includes two laser printers, networking cables and accessories, and some laboratory supplies.   This project can encourage students to complete the physics courses at the college, to improve their science experience, and to expose current and future teachers to an instructional method other than the traditional lecture format.",
