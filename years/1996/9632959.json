Research  will  include electron-vibration energy transfer processes between  F-  centers  and  molecular defects will be investigated  using  resonance  Raman scattering, vibrational luminescence and Fourier transform infra-  red  spectroscopy. A newly developed technique will be used to produce  high-quality  ultra-thin  crystals in  the  range  0.2  -100  mm.  The  influence  of  the mesoscopic size on the films on the energy-transfer  and  phase behavior of the materials will be investigated and may lead  to new optical materials or research possibilities.  %%%  This project involves the study of the optical properties of materials  which  are  typically used in laser devices. One area of  interest  is  that  of energy transfer processes that need to be understand in order  to  optimize  the  optical  and lasing properties  of  the  materials.  Another  important  area is that of thin films of  optical  materials,  where  the  reduced size of the medium changes the  properties  of  in  crystals  in new and incompletely understood ways. The study of  these  materials may lead to new laser materials or devise applications.  ***",
