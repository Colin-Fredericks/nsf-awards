 "awd_abstract_narration": "9629539  David J. Anderson     The number of offspring that individuals can produce depends on the amount of food and care they can provide.  Birds are good organisms to study how foraging, resource allocation among offspring, and sibling competition affect the number of young produced.  Three sets of  birds will be studied.  In the first project, the foraging patterns of widely ranging seabirds, Laysan and black-footed albatrosses near the Hawaiian Islands, will be used to test hypotheses linking their slow reproductive rates to their foraging biology.  The data will be distributed in near-real time to over 39,000 fifth and sixth grade students via email and educational satellite networks.  These students will participate in the data analysis, to increase their scientific literacy and to attract them to scientific careers.  The second project will study nestling competition in two species of boobies, seabirds of the Galapagos Islands. The regulation of sibling competition will be studied, to understand why a nestling bird sometimes kills its sibling nestmate.  The third project will study variation in offspring sex ratio in broods of the American kestrel.  Mothers provide sons with larger eggs, although sons die more than daughters do from sibling competition.  Undergraduate students will use DNA fingerprinting to determine how this size difference arises.    These studies will increase the understanding of tradeoffs in allocating resources, for number of offspring versus their survival rates.  This is useful for plant and animal breeding and for conservation biology.",
