 "awd_abstract_narration": "9505886  Palathingal  When the electromagnetic energy released as a positron gets  annihilated in flight with a bound atomic electron in the Coulomb  field of the nucleus, meets the energy criterion for resonance  absorption, the excitation of the nucleus could be a possible  result.  There are major discrepancies between the results of  calculations of this phenomenon and the available experimental  data.  The various experiments conducted so far have all suffered  from common disadvantages.  They utilized whole spectra of  positrons derived from radioactive sources and thick targets.  Metastable states of the nucleus were studied for periods of a  few life times.  The results were not accurate, and were prone to  ambiguities for interpretation.  In view of this, experiments  have been called for that would use monoenergetic positrons and  thin targets.  Such studies will be undertaken utilizing the  Dynamitron at Brookhaven and at ORELA at Oak Ridge National Lab.  Short-lived states will be studied, that would make a continuous-  running beam experiment possible.  Thin targets of varied  thickness will be used.  Secondary effects that might contribute  to the nuclear excitation alongside the single-quantum  annihilation, proposed by differing theoretical models,  would be  explored.  It is expected that data could be derived that would  be accessible for unambiguous interpretation, and would lead to  a clear understanding of the physical processes underlying the  phenomenon.  ***",
