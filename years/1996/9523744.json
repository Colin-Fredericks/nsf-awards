 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Paul Fish, Mr. John Carpenter will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will analyze mortuary remains which were excavated many years ago near Guasave, Sinalo in Northern Mexico. The mound, which was originally believed to be an habitation, proved in fact to be a burial mound which contained almost 200 human skeletons and associated grave goods. These materials, which are housed in the American Museum of Natural History, have never been fully analyzed. Mr. Carpenter will conduct a detailed examination and in particular will focus on the variation among individuals. On this basis it will be possible to determine the extent to which the society itself was socially stratified and the degree of social complexity it achieved. These materials are very poorly dated and radiocarbon determinations will be made to determine exact chronological placement.  Extensive archaeological research has provided detailed information on the rise of complex prehistoric cultural entities in the U.S. Southwest and massive ruins such a Chaco Canyon in New Mexico attest to the level of social organization attained. Likewise much is known about the civilizations of Central Mexico. However the area between these two centers are poorly known from an archaeological perspective and archaeologists wish to understand whether this region served as a bridge between the North and South, whether it was a hinterland or whether it followed an independent cultural trajectory. The research by Mr. Carpenter will provide insight into this question.  This work is important for several reasons. It will shed new light into the development of New World civilization. It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists and assist in the training of a promising young scientist.",
