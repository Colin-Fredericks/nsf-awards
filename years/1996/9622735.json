 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622735  Renardy    The proposer will study a number of issues in fluid dynamics, which lead  to mathematical problems in partial differential equations, dynamical  systems, asymptotic analysis and numerical analysis. Specific topics   include the study of corner singularities and high Weissenberg number  asymptotics in viscoelastic flows, the development of a basic existence theory  for degenerate parabolic-hyperbolic systems arising in surfactant spreading,  instabilities in ocean currents, the numerical treatment of outflow   boundaries, and Takens-Bodganov bifurcations with symmetry which arise  in double layer convection.  %%%  Part of the work is motivated by problems which are encountered in the   numerical simulation of flows of polymeric fluids. Such simulations are  important in predicting fluid behavior in industrial processes and in  evaluating theories of material behavior. Geometries with corners are  frequently encountered, and the singular behavior arising from such   corners has led to considerable difficulties in numerical simulation,   which have not been adequately resolved. Another numerical difficulty  has arisen from the formation of sharp boundary layers in highly elastic  flows. In both cases, progress hinges crucially on clarifying the   analytical nature of the solution, and the proposed research aims at doing  that. Another important topic in numerical simulation of fluid flows is  the truncation of the flow domain for numerical purposes. Here, the   proposed research is concerned with providing the reasons why certain  procedures work. Surfactant spreading on thin films is important in   biological and medical problems. Mathematically, it leads into a new  type of partial differential equations, which does not seem to have   analyzed previously. The proposed research aims at understanding   fundamental issues related to these equations. Fluid dynamics is rife  with instabilities and formation of new flow patterns. Flows with a high  degree of symmetry, such as conv ection between parallel plates, are known  to allow a rich variety of patterns. The inclusion of a second fluid layer  leads to additional possibilities, which the proposed research will   explore.  ***",
