 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research pursues some questions which are related to and  inspired in part by discussions the P.I., Dr. Diane Meuser, has had  and and continue to have with Professor Kazhdan and Professor Mazur  of Harvard University.    Professor Meuser is studying properties of a generalized p-adic  local Igusa zeta function.  A special case is the \"p-adic volume\"  of a variety which is the integral of the analytic differential w  on a compact analytic variety X and it is this case that she has  been discussing with Kazhdan and Mazur.  A special case she is  working on in detail is the generalized zeta function in the case  where X is an elliptic curve and w is the unique invariant  differential on the elliptic curve.    Interactive activities include: involvement with graduate and  undergraduate women through a Women in Mathematics organization,  and serving as a faculty advisor to a residence hall at Harvard  University.",
