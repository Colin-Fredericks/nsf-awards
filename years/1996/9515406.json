 "awd_abstract_narration": "Authorship is central to the recognition and reward system of science, yet the meaning of authorship has changed profoundly as science has changed from the avocation of individuals to a professional occupation characterized by increasing collaboration.  Indeed, in some fields, such as experimental high-energy physics or fusion research, papers may be routinely authored by dozens of researchers.    The goal of this conference is to analyze patterns of change in scientific authorship by examining different institutional structures, disciplinary practices, genres of scientific literature, socio-political contexts, techniques of communication, and patterns of organization and responsibility.  It is important and timely, as authorship lies at the core of contemporary concerns about intellectual property and scientific misconduct.  Further, the advent of electronic publishing will pose a further challenge to conventional notions of authorship.  The proposed conference would draw together leading scholars in science studies to present papers on various facets of this topic and to participate in extensive, open discussion of emerging issues.  The conference has already attracted partial support from the Mellon Foundation and from the host institution, Harvard University.",
