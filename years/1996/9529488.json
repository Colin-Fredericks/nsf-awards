Michigan State University    CISE Research Instrumentation for ATM Networking    The Computer Science Department at Michigan State University (MSU) requested support to purchase equipment for upgrading an existing research laboratory, the High-Speed Networking & Performance Laboratory (HSNP).  HSNP was established in 1993, with primary support from NSF and additional funds from the AT&T Foundation and MSU.  This Laboratory supports a testbed that consists of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switches interconnected by fiber optics links to a collection of SPARC-10 workstations.  In order to serve the growing number of faculty and students (both graduate and undergraduate) interested in experimental research activities associated with the mission of HSNP, additional equipment is needed.  The equipment essential for upgrading the current facilities to provide expanded research opportunities includes: (1) An ATM traffic generator/analyzer, (2) OC-3 upgrade packages for existing ATM switches and Interface cards, (3) An ATM SynOptics switch and Interface card, (4) A RAID disk storage system, (5) ATM-related software, and  (6) Advanced multimedia workstations.   This requested equipment will be used to enhance both the quality and scope of on-going as well as future research in ATM technology (e.g., multimedia traffic modeling, traffic policing mechanisms, bandwidth allocation algorithms, buffer management schemes, and admission control algorithms) and in high-speed networking issues in distributed parallel computing, performance analysis, and interoperability.  The results of this research will contribute to the development of ATM technology to support multimedia applications over high-speed networks.",
