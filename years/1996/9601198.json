 "awd_abstract_narration": "9601198  Eickbush   Transposable elements, abundant components of eukaryotic genomes, have probably played a significant role in determining the size and structure of these genomes. R1 and R2 are retrotransposable elements found inserted in the 28S ribosomal RNA genes in all insect lineage's and in all classes of Arthropods. R1 and R2 elements from modern and ancient insect orders, as well as from each class of Arthropod will be isolated and sequenced in the region of the open reading frame. That information will be used to construct a phylogenetic tree with the goal of determining if the elements have been present since the origin of arthropods. The origin and stability of highly divergent families of R1 and/or R2 within the genus Drosophila will be studied. The questions of whether each family can independently regulate its own level of insertion and of horizontal transfer will be addressed. The population dynamics of these elements in species where they are maintained at high and low average levels will be investigated. These studies will be complemented by computer simulations to determine whether simple models of recombination and retrotransposition can explain the observed distributions.  %%%  Mobile elements or their remnants represent as much as 30% of the genomes of most eukaryotes. It is probable that these elements have had a significant impact on size and structure of eukaryotic chromosomes and it is remarkable that many basic questions concerning their evolution, regulation and costs or benefits to their hosts remain unanswered. This study will add to the little we know of the genetic impact of transposable elements in host genomes.  ***",
