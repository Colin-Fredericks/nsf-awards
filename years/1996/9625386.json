 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625386  Moazzami  In most building codes, there are very limited guidelines  regarding the proportioning of the shear walls and coupling  beams.  Consequently, the response of the coupled wall  assemblies to dynamic loads has been noted to fall short of  acceptable ductile behavior.  This project discusses some of  the current practices in proportioning and design of coupled  wall assemblies, highlights some of the shortcomings of these  methods, and proposes a new approach that aims at a more  comprehensive design of coupled wall assemblies.  In particular the hysteretic response of the coupled wall  assemblies will be studied based on a proposed mathematical  model.  The primary concern of this study is to assess the  magnitude of cyclic energy dissipation, and determine the  balance that must be achieved between strength, stiffness,  and ductility capacity of structural members in order to  optimize energy dissipation in the system.  The outcome of  this investigation is a set of design guidelines for  proportioning structural members for optimum energy  dissipation and stable hysteretic response.***",
