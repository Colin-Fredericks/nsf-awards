AAES is providing the chair and secretariat for the WFEO Technology Committee.  The Committee s mission is  to lead the engineering profession worldwide in the promotion and application of sustainable technologies .  In pursuit of that mission, the Committee s objective is to encourage research into and educate about sustainable technologies by collecting and disseminating information available from multiple sources including several parts of the US government, other US sources, and from foreign sources via other members of WFEO.  Among the transfer methodologies to be explored for possible use by AAES and the WFEO Technology Committee to carry out this objective would be the new Global Network for Environmental Technology (GNET) and the World Engineering Network (WEnet).  GNET is an electronic communications system developed by the U.S. Government for exchanging information and locating opportunities in environmental technology.  WEnet is a compu terized information and networking system, integral to GNET, which has been developed by the World Engineering Partnership for Sustainable Development for use by the world engineering community. ***                                                               Oh     +'  0                                       $       H       l                                               D       h                                                   R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       ENG -9527601                        Deborah   S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   #                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           J.
