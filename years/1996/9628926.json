 "awd_abstract_narration": "9628926  Dorsey  This research will focus on the theory of vortex dynamics in  superconductors, an area of great scientific and  technological relevance.  The first part of the grant  involves projects aimed at understanding vortex dynamics in  thin films.  In particular, it has recently been observed  that when a thin superconducting film is placed in a  sufficiently strong magnetic field, the field enters in the  form of \"magnetic dendrites.\"  To understand this phenomenon  we will study the propagation and dynamic stability of  interfaces between a vortex liquid and the Meissner phase,  in both the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory and a  hydrodynamic theory of superconducting vortices.  The second  part of the grant is a study of the effect of order  parameter symmetry on vortex dynamics in the mixed state;  this work is motivated by the possibility that the order  parameter in some of the high temperature superconductors  may have a d-wave character.  Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau  theories for d-wave superconductors will be developed and  used to study the longitudinal and Hall conductivities, as  well as the Nernst effect, in the mixed state.  Since there  are some features of the transport properties which are  beyond this description, we will develop quasiclassical  Green's function techniques for d-wave superconductors.  These methods will be used to calculate the Hall effect and  the Nernst effect in the mixed state, two quantities which  have displayed anomalous properties in the high temperature  superconductors and which have eluded a consistent  theoretical description.  %%%  Theoretical research will  be conducted on a variety of  problems related to the motion of magnetic vortices which  form in the high temperature superconductors.  These  vortices and their response to magnetic fields are important  in technological applications of superconductors.  They are  also of great fundamental interest.  ***",
