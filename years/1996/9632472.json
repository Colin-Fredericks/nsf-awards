The unifying theme of the research is  the design and characterization of structured materials with  unique properties for potential technological applications.  One  group investigates electroactive and magnetoactive molecular  materials by designing molecular materials for specific  electroresponsive or magnetoresponsive properties.  A second  group studies narrow bandgap strained-layer semiconductor  materials and focuses on the synthesis, stability, and properties  of these materials.  Strain and/or ordering is used to tailor  the band structure, and hence the optical properties.  This work  has high potential impact on the area of room temperature  infrared lasers and improved infrared detectors.  Other  applications include optical communications and optical computers  which take advantage of the highly non-linear optical constants  of these materials.  A third group investigates optically  functional polymers and molecular assemblies, bringing to bear a  combination of synthesis, materials characterization, and  theoretical approaches on problems of fundamental and applied  significance in the area of polymers with optical nonlinearities.  A fourth group studies ultrahard coatings with the goal of  stabilizing and/or nucleating normally unstable phases,  specifically certain nitrides, epitaxially on carefully chosen  substrates.  A fifth group working on functional electroceramic  thin films will synthesize and characterize thin ceramic films  for advanced dielectric and nonlinear optical applications and  will extend the deposition and characterization  techniques to  novel transparent conducting oxides.  The MRSEC supports the  development, operation and maintenance of shared experimental  facilities for materials research.  It provides seed funding for  exploratory research and fosters research participation by  unde rgraduates.  The Center supports an educational outreach  program aimed at pre-college science education through  development of the Materials World Modules, and a program  featuring research experiences for science teachers.  The Center  also administers an industrial outreach program.  The Center  currently supports 35 senior investigators, 5 postdoctoral  research associates, 7 technicians or other professionals, 34  graduate students, and 16 undergraduates.  The MRSEC is directed  by Professor R.P.H. Chang.  %%%  The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at  Northwestern University supports interactive research in five  interdisciplinary groups.
