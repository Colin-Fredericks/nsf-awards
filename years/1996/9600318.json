The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit which will support Dr. Frank Y. Wang to work with  Professor Jean-Marc Charbonnier at the von Karman Institute  for Fluid Dynamics in Belgium.        This project involves investigating experimentally the  dynamic stability characteristics of a reentry capsule and  their relation to the downstream wake flow at low speed.  Dr. Wang and Professor Charbonnier will measure aerodynamic  coefficients of a capsule-like body, mean and turbulent  quantities of the boundary layer and the downstream wake  flows, and do flow visualization.  An existing support  system specifically designed for the investigation of the  stability of capsule-like bodies will be used for both  mounting the model and measuring its global aerodynamic  coefficients.  Shadowgraph/Schlieren visualization will be  utilized as an initial step to globally characterize the  wake flow.  The flow diagnostic effort will then concentrate  on the use of particle image velocimetry (PIV) to map out  the boundary layer and wake characteristics.  In addition, a  parallel investigation of the flow fields using conventional  miniature five-hole probes will be carried out to address  the applicability of the PIV technique in this type of  problems.  The measurement of aerodynamic coefficients is  crucial in providing the necessary information to ensure the  safe return of astronauts.  The detailed documentation of  the boundary layer and wake flow fields will broaden the  existing database for transonic blunt bodies, aiding the  development and validation of computational models, as well  as offering an unprecedented opportunity to examine the  dynamic  interaction between the flow over the capsule and  its downstream wake.  ***",
