The award is to  Portland State University, but faculty and graduate students  from the University of Oregon and Oregon State University are heavily   involved as well.  Additional participants, including graduate students,   postdocs, and faculty investigators, represent other states and foreign   countries.  Previous workshops of the same nature include a 1993 conference  in Oregon and earlier workshops in Luttach, Italy.  The site of this year's  workshop is Mazama, Washington, in the Northern Cascade Mountains.       The workshop has been planned for nine days beginning September 30,  and this duration allows the detailed program to evolve somewhat in response  to preferences expressed by particpants upon their arrival.  Those invited  have expertise in quantum groups, low dimensional topology, combinatorial  homotopy, algebraic K-theory, and combinatorial group theory.  The goal is  to obtain progress in areas relating to the application of quantum groups  as topological obstruction groups, new classification schemes for manifolds  and 2-complexes, new computational methods for the second homotopy group,  further inroads on the Kervaire-Laudenbach conjecture, application of the  tools of automatic groups to low dimensional homotopy theory, and issues  relating to Whitehead's asphericity conjecture.  Past experience suggests  that unexpected connections will be made and that these will be at least  as significant as any that could be foreseen.  ***",
