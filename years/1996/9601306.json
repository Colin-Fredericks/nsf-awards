Yet little is known about the process of early word  learning, partly because of the methodological barriers  researchers have faced in attempting to work with preverbal and  barely verbal children.  This research will use two new methods  to investigate how young children (approximately 10-24 months of  age) learn the words of their native language.  The particular  focus will be on how children learn object names since, around  the world, object names predominate in children's earliest  vocabularies.  Previous research has suggested that children are  guided by a set of six principles in learning new words,  principles which narrow the range of choices which children must  consider for what a new word might mean.  These principles are  organized into two \"tiers,\" with the first tier present by the  end of the first year of life.  The three principles in the first  tier are (1) \"reference,\" or the idea that a word can \"map to\" or  become linked to an object in the world, (2) \"extendibility,\" the  fact that a word does not just name the original object but a  class of objects (e.g., \"dog\" does not just label Fido, the  family dog, but all dogs), and (3) \"object scope,\" the assumption  that a new word labels an object (as opposed to say, an action)  and that it labels the whole object (versus just an interesting  part of the object).  The eleven experiments in this project are  designed to understand how children derive these three principles  of the first tier.  In all the experiments, children will be  taught the names of novel objects under various conditions in  order to probe the processes by which they learn new words.    Since young children do not often talk on command, in all the  experiments, children will be asked to show their word learning  facility through their language comprehension instead of through  language production.  The research will seek to answer three  questions.   The fi rst is the question of emergence, i.e., when  does each principle appear and does each principle have both a  mature and an immature form?  The second is the question of  mechanism, i.e., what mechanisms are responsible for the  appearance of each principle and do children of different ages  rely on different cues as they deploy these principles for word  learning?   The finally question is that of language specificity,  i.e., do words have some special status for children (the way  they do for adults) or are they treated just the same as other  environmental sounds?  For example, does an object's name come to  stand for the child's concept of that object, in a way different  from, say, the sound that the object makes?  Answers to these  questions will illuminate the mysterious process by which word  learning occurs as well as advance knowledge of cognitive  development in general.  Furthermore, as we succeed in lessening  the mystery of word learning, we will be in a far better position  to use our knowledge of the word learning process to aid those  children who are having difficulty with that process.    ***",
