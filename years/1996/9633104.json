It will be held in the United States during the summer of 1996, possibly the only time in the foreseeable future that the Congress will be held in the U.S.  There will be 112 technical sessions in area including:  (1) energy, safety, environment; (2) future chemical process technologies, products and materials; (3) agriculture, food, biotechnology and biomedical; (4) technology management and transfer; and (5) advanced fundamentals.      Chemical engineers in the United States face global challenges that will continue to affect both the industries in which they work and the world in which they live.  By focusing on innovations and applications of chemical engineering technologies, the World Congress is expected to advance the profession's knowledge and the nation's industrial competitiveness.",
