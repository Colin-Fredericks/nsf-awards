 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Peter Levy and junior members of  his research group at New York University to collaborate in solid  state physics research with Professor Peter Weinberger and his  research group of the Institute of Electrochemistry of the  Technical University of Vienna, Austria.  A third member of the  collaboration is Professor I. Mertig of the Technical University  of Dresden, Germany. .  Through collaboration, they expect to  develop models and perform calculations that will provide new  insights into the factors that control the magnetotransport  properties of transition-metal magnetic multilayers.   While all  three groups are theoretical in their orientation, their efforts  are complementary.  The US group is focused on analytical and  model calculations while the expertise of the Austrian group lies  in the ab-initio calculation of electronic structure, magnetic  and transport properties of solids.  Professor Mertig of Dresden  has considerable expertise in the application of multiple  scattering theory to the calculation of impurity scattering in  ferromagnetic metals.  The `giant magnetoresistance` of magnetic multilayers is  interesting both for the fundamental physics needed to explain  its origins and for its applicability to emerging computer  technologies.  While there is consensus that this effect comes  from the magnetic field changing the spin-dependent scattering of  the conduction electrons, the there are many unresolved questions  about how this is achieved and which are the dominant factors at  different levels of the multiple layers.  This trilateral  collaboration will address some of those questions, and  contribute some of the new understanding of this phenomenon  needed before any attempt can be made to manipulate and use it.",
