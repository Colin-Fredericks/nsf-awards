 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grau, Hector R  U. of Colorado, Boulder   This project will assess how tree species diversity is affected by disturbances across a range of spatial scales, and how disturbance regimes are related to elevational gradients in subtropical montane forests in northwestern Argentina.  It is hypothesized that in the higher montane forest, low diversity is maintained by frequent fire.  In the lower montane forest, high diversity is promoted by the occurrence of small-scale treefall gaps.  Abrupt changes in diversity between the higher and lower montane forest are believed to be caused by shifts in disturbance regimes that reflect the influences of both the underlying physical environmental gradients and vegetation responses to these gradients.  Research methods will include dendroecological records of disturbance regimes at a stand and landscape scale, spatial and temporal patterns of tree recruitment in relation to bamboo cover, stand-scale measures of diversity, and the use of remote sensing to map the limit between lower and higher montane forests.  The results will yield information on how climatic change and anthropogenic changes in disturbance regimes affect biodiversity.",
