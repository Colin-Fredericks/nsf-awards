Foci will include student capability to: (a) design new representations;(b) to critique, compare and refine them;(c) to select appropriate ones and learn to use them efficiently; and (d) to understand what represents are for and how they work.  The project will investigate the relation of meta-representational competence to conceptual development and will also design and research classroom instructional activities that effectively utilize and develop meta-representational competence.  Results will help teachers better understand students' strengths and weakness in learning representations in mathematics and science, and will open up an attractive new genre of authentic scientific learning activities that can involve students have a wide range of intellectual styles and abilities.    ***",
