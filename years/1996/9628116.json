 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent technological advances have lead to the deployment of high-speed  networks which are capable of supporting a large number of applications in  an integrated fashion.  In this environment, the time required for the  transmission of a fixed size information block (slot) has been constantly  decreasing.  A direct consequence of a shrinking slot is that time  intervals (in seconds) increase in size, when measured in network time  units (slots).  As a result, time intervals which were considered to be too  small in the past seem larger and -- for that matter -- their  interpretation and associated functionalities may need to be reconsidered.  In the shrinking slot environment time is becoming a commodity which may be  used more effectively in the design of high-speed networks.    The proposed research will be focused on the development of traffic  management schemes which incorporate rather explicitly the significant  time-constants (in slots) associated with the traffic generation process  and QoS descriptors of the diversified applications in a high speed  networking environment. Both, traditional computer-data-type and real time  applications will be considered.    In the first part of the proposed research, a Time-Constant-Based Call  Admission and Traffic Control (TC-based CATC) framework is presented, for  controllable (or, ABR/UBR in ATM Forum's classification) applications.  This proposal is based on the positive impact of a large time-constant  associated with a controllable application, on the effectiveness of a  feedback-based traffic control scheme; this impact has been observed in  preliminary results.  The proposed class of TC-based traffic control  policies can be viewed as a class of ``generalized'' adaptive, rate-based  traffic control policies, since classical adaptive, rate-based policies are  included in this large class. As a result, there is great potential to  substantially improve on the performance achieved by the past schemes.  The  TC-based CATC scheme is expected to  provide for a faster response to  bandwidth availability fluctuations at different time-scales, by employing  distinct mechanisms for the different time-scales. It is easy to argue that  the proposed TC-based policies are scalable.    In the second part of the proposed research, multiplexing schemes for  real-time applications are considered.  These schemes attempt to preserve  time-constants of importance associated with these applications and/or take  advantage of time-constant-based Quality of Service requirement, to  maximize resource utilization. Specific proposals include the integration  of the regulation and scheduling functions to improve performance by  coordinating their functionality, as well as ``reinvent'' statistical  multiplexing for real-time applications by taking advantage od the  increased room for traffic manipulation in time, as the network speed  increases and QoS-defining time-constants increase.    Finally, a major part of the proposed research will be dedicated to the  study of a number of interesting problems arising from the above proposals,  which are becoming increasingly relevant to the broad high speed networking  environment as the network time unit decreases.",
