 "awd_abstract_narration": "The biological ancestry of contemporary African Americans lies in slaves transported from  Africa. Among the largest, earliest and historically best described burial grounds of African  slaves is that at Newton Plantation, Barbados. About 100 individuals of African ancestry buried  between 1660 and 1820 have been excavated here, but originally only the cranial parts were  retained for analysis. This project, with the full support of Barbadian people and government  through the Barbados Museum and Historical Society, aims to recover the postcranial skeletal  elements for the 80 or so relatively complete adult individuals. Analysis incorporating modern  techniques can yield better information on the gender and age at death of individuals for  demographic analyses, and indicate pathologies such as anemia, activity related arthrosis of the  joints, disease and nutrition stress, cortical bone maintenance, and bony reaction to infectious  diseases (some of which, such as malaria and treponematoses, can be specifically diagnosed).  This will add greatly to the inadequate historical accounts of slave lives and adaptations.",
