 "awd_abstract_narration": "A  project-based  course in environmental field methods  will  be  developed  for  students  in the second  year  of  earth  science  programs,  creating a new context for students'  first  encounter  with  more complex, and in particular, more quantitative  science  topics.  By  teaching geophysical and geochemical  field  methods  through  a  sequence of in-depth studies of current environmental  problems,  presented in their historical and social  context,  we  hope  to keep students, especially women and minorities,  in  the  quantitative science pipeline and make clear their own  potential  for   such   work.  Students  will  work  through   environmental  \"case-studies\", or project modules, on topics such as salt  water  intrusion in coastal Florida, uranium mining remediation  in  the  Navajo  Nation, and eutrophication in a Georgia estuary. Students  will process a subset of the data, combine data sets, analyze and  interpret  the data, define limits to their interpretations,  and  make  and  justify  policy decisions. The course  will  be  built  around six or seven sequential modules, with each module designed  to follow a classroom introduction to the relevant field methods.  We plan to add supporting materials to these modules so that they  can  also  `e  used  as individual case studies in  environmental  geology,  hydrology,  geophysics, and geochemistry  courses,  and  will  be  in a form that can be disseminated on the WWW,  CD-rom,  and hardcopy.    This  work  will  be a collaborative effort by  four  faculty  at  disparate  institutions  (College of  William  and  Mary,  Navajo  Community College, and Georgia Tech). Each of us will design  one  or   two  modules,  working  with  undergraduates  at  our   home  institutions.  We  will collaboratively review  and  revise  each  module  as  we develop the course as a whole. Thus students  will  encounter a wider range of both geographic settings and  cultural  contexts  for environmental problems than is currently  found  in  qua ntitative geoscience courses.",
