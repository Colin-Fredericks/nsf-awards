 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1994, Japan changed the electoral system used to choose members of the lower house of the Diet.  Single member districts replaced local multi-members districts.  Nine new regional proportional representation constituencies were also established.  Japan's first election under the new system will occur in 1996.   This unique historical event provides a laboratory for the study of first-order effects of institutional change in a major industrial democracy.    Japan has long had a strong \"personal vote\" tradition which many believe resulted from the competition between candidates from the same party in multi-member districts.  Others believe the personal vote reflects political culture moreso than established electoral institutions.  By examining the party, candidate and voter behavior during the election, this project will determine if and how institutions matter.  The study will also investigate the effects of reform on attitudes toward democracy in Japan.  Much as in the American case, there exists a prevailing deep mistrust and apathy that affects whether people vote and how they make electoral choices.  Whether reform can make a difference in the way the Japanese relate to their government can be an important component of governmental stability in one of the world's most important democracies.",
