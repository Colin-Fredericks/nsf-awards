 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626279  Smith  The transmission electron microscope (TEM) has been a mainstay of  materials research for about forty years and remains one of the  world's most important scientific instruments.  Over the last 20  years Lehigh has maintained a leadership position in analytical  TEM research and in the education of TEM users.  This award  provides funds in partial support of the purchase of an automated  digital transmission electron microscope (ADTEM) for chemical and  structural imaging of materials with an emphasis on in-situ  studies.  The ADTEM will combine better than 0.23 nm resolution  with  30  of tilt in a variety of side entry specimen holders.  The microscope will feature an electron energy filter which can  produce high clarity energy-filtered images and diffraction  patterns.  Included is support for enhancing and up-grading the  specimen preparation equipment and image analysis facilities.  The digitally acquired images will be accessible from any  networked terminal on or off campus.  %%%  The acquisition of the proposed ADTEM will impact these ongoing  or planned research programs in the four thrust areas of:  1)  thin films, 2)  amorphous and nanoscale structures, 3)  ceramics  and ceramic composites, and 4)  environment-sensitive fracture.  The research programs of more than 20 faculty will be impacted by  the proposed ADTEM.  The research programs in the area of thin  films include a study of CoPt for magnetic information storage  and the role of grain structure and grain boundary diffusion in  the reaction of Nb/Al, Ni/Al and Ti/Al multilayers.  Under the  thrust area of amorphous and nanoscale structures a variety of  studies in inorganic and organic materials are being pursed:  crystallization of amorphous silicon, development of copper  interconnects with optimized grain structures, determination of  structure around light atoms in inorganic glasses by EXELFS,  novel design concepts in core/shell particles for toughening  engineering plastics, and energy filtered diffracti on of beam  sensitive catalyst materials.  In the thrust area of ceramics and  ceramic composites, tailoring of grain boundary chemistry for the  development of super creep-resistant oxides, processing and  properties of nanocomposites, and reaction forming of  functionally gradient aluminum oxide/aluminum composites for  optimal mechanical properties are under investigation.  The  research programs in the last thrust area of environment-  sensitive fracture address environmental and stochastic aspects  of creep crack growth in super-alloys and corrosion and fatigue  of aluminum alloys.    The educational role of the ADTEM will be to demonstrate high  resolution structure imaging, advanced diffraction, and energy  filtered microscopy in the laboratory section of a variety of  undergraduate and graduate courses.  Digital images from this  microscope will be analyzed by students off-line in our existing  cluster of IBM RS6000s and proposed cluster of Macintosh 8100s.  ***",
