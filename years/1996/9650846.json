 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computerized data acquisition can be used in undergraduate Biology classes to facilitate scientific thinking in beginning as well as advanced students. The Biopac system consists of a data converter and software which can be used to expand experimental opportunities, increase the accuracy of physiologic data, and make possible the application of the experimental method in one laboratory session. Undergraduate students, having limited laboratory time, can use the Biopac system to deftly generate and manipulate a broad array of physiologic data (e.g. spirometry, bioelectric patterns, muscle contraction, heart and korotkoff sounds). Even introductory Biology students can successfully use the Biopac system to form and test an original hypothesis, generate and compile data, and make conclusions within the laboratory time allotted. Advanced students in Physiology can use the Biopac system to generate physiologic data not possible with existing equipment. The Macintosh computer interface allows literature search, networking of students, sophisticated manipulation of the data, and reporting of results. The ease of data acquisition, facility of manipulation, and expanded data forms provided will increase opportunities for original discovery in Physiology. Through the use of independent experimentation, students will develop increased scientific proficiency and interest. Through the hands-on, computer-based interactive approach, students will share in an increased scientific self-confidence and appreciation that will benefit them and society at large.",
