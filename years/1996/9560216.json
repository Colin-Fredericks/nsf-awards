 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate X-ray diffraction as an accurate, cost-effective method to monitor and control wafer temperature in a Rapid Thermal Processing (RTP) furnace.  RTP is a key element for the next generation of semiconductor fabrication facilities, especially for the cluster tool environment.  A major barrier to wider use of RTP, as the processing method of choice, is the lack of an accurate, reproducible measurement of wafer temperature.  This is critical to the reliable production of thin films with the required physical and chemical characteristics.  Current methods used to monitor wafer temperature are handicapped by either wafer bowing or changes in emissivity resulting from thin film stress and growth.  Phase I will design an X-ray probe for precise temperature measurement which is relatively insensitive to these effects, and is still cost effective.  The required precision of temperature measurement will be demonstrated using a low-power X-ray source.       Expanded use of RTP equipment is expected, either as stand-alone processing tools or in the integrated cluster tool environment.  This would benefit both military electronics development, as well as commercial semiconductor manufacturering, as identified in the 1994 IS National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors.",
