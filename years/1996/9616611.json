The results of the research will be used to design and develop a network-based learning environment that supports a range of asynchronous and synchronous collaborative interaction among distributed teams on heterogeneous platforms.  The project will involve collaborations between social scientists studying social and task environments in learning, and computer scientists developing collaboration technologies that will support these environments.",
