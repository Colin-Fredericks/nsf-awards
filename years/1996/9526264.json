 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this study is to investigate a number of  theoretical issues in language acquisition through an  experimental study on two particular instances of the placement  of specific objects, namely scrambling and clitic placement, in  Dutch child language (since Dutch displays both phenomena).  Although both scrambling and clitic placement have been discussed  extensively in the linguistic literature on adult grammar, they  have been studied only marginally in child language so far.  Consequently, we know very little about this aspect of child  grammar.         The data will be collected in Utrecht, The Netherlands.  Seventy Dutch children, ages 2;0 - 6;0 will be tested on their  interpretation of scrambling and clitic placement with an  elicitation and/or an imitation task.         The results of this study will contribute to the virtually  non-existing body of cross-linguistic research into the  development of clitic placement and scrambling. In addition, it  will illuminate the linguistic analysis of the placement of  specific objects, such as specific DPs (scrambling) and clitics  (clitic placement) in adult Dutch. Furthermore, the study will  bear on theories regarding the development of child language,  such as the 'Maturation Hypothesis' (Borer and Wexler, 1987), the  'Continuity Hypothesis' (Pinker, 1984; Clahsen, 1992) and the  'Principles and Parameters Theory'.",
