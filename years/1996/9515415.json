 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation enhancement grant provides partial support for a U.S. graduate student, Stephen A. McCord, working under the guidance of Dr. Geoffrey Schladow, of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of California-Davis, to perform field studies and develop computer simulations for controlled degassing of Lake Nyos in Cameroon.  Mr. McCord will visit Lake Nyos to collect samples and record data on internal wave activity and fine scale temperature and conductivity structures, which will then be used to model the dynamics of Lake Nyos.  It is intended to model the use of  in situ lake remediation techniques to safely lower the gas concentrations, which have been increasing since the last outgassing in 1986, and to predict the resulting water quality changes due to artificial mixing.  Further, the proposed model may be used in a wide variety of lakes and reservoirs to address water quality and management issues.  Staff members of the Automation and Control Laboratory at the University of Yaounde will collaborate with Mr. McCord on this project.   This study will make an important contribution to the understanding of the science of lake hydrodynamics, especially the  chemical and physical factors affecting lake stability.  The grant will also provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.",
