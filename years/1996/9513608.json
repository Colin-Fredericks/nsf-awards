 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal would fund an advanced optical trapping  microscope facility. The recent success of one- and two-beam  optical traps in cell biology has led to breakthroughs in  our understanding of how biological motors work, and  provided scientists with unprecedented means of  micromanipulation. The time is ripe to extend the utility of  optical trapping in interdisciplinary directions,  particularly towards the interface of molecular biology and  materials science, to address outstanding problems in such  areas as biophysics and nanotechnology. The Multiple Beam  Optical Trapping (MBOT) microscope is a versatile,  third-generation device, designed ab initio for  micromanipulation and micromechanical measurement. It will  be capable of generating several simultaneous trapping beams  under computer control, each equipped with independent  controls, and will incorporate position sensors to detect  displacements of objects down to the subnanometer level. The  beams can be alternately configured to grasp, manipulate.  develop tension, determine position, image, or, in feedback  mode, to measure force. Aspects of the microscope hardware  will be linked to microprocessors that will control the  operation, collect data, and perform image processing.. A  set of four auxiliary microscopes will constitute an  integral part of the overall facility, serving double-duty  as teaching tools and as test beds for prototyping and  developing equipment destined for the central microscope, as  well as to explore new approaches to imaging and optical  trapping.          A key feature of multiple independent traps is that  they permit two or more objects to be freely manipulated,  oriented, and juxtaposed in all three dimensions, without  necessarily passing laser light directly through the objects  themselves, which might not tolerate the exposure. In  addition, experimental geometries can be achieved that are  quite impossible with conventional, single- or double-beam  optical tweezers. A way to generate multiple  traps and avoid  optical interference effects is to time share the traps. In  this scheme, all traps are produced by a single laser beam  that is scanned rapidly among different positions, pausing  at those locations where traps are desired. A prototype for  this concept was developed in the Netherlands, where  galvanometer mirrors were used to scan the beam. The MBOT  design calls for the use of acousto-optic beam deflectors to  achieve faster scan rates with inherently less jitter.          Among the potential uses of the MBOT instrument are:  (1) Single-motor motility assays, to measure the tiny  stepwise displacements and forces produced by individual  mechanoenzymes, such as kinesin and myosin, as well as those  produced by processive nucleic acid enzymes, such as RNA  polymerase; (2) Picotensiometry, to measure the molecular  elasticity of biopolymers such as microtubules and actin  filaments, as well as the micromechanical properties of  biomimetic and other novel materials; (3) Optical force  microscopy (OFM), a promising variation of scanned-probe  microscopy that uses an optically-trapped stylus to obtain  images under physiological conditions with a resolution  exceeding that possible with the conventional light  microscope; (4) Characterization of coupling forces involved  in protein receptor-ligand binding, cell-cell and  cell-substrate recognition, and RNA/DNA base-pairing; and  (5) Creation of miniature hybrid devices consisting of both  biological components (cells, microtubules, enzymes) and  synthetic components (glass, silicon, etc.) on  rnicrofabricated chips. As proposed, the instrument would be  jointly funded by the .NSF and a private foundation, and  housed in the Princeton Materials Institute. It is  anticipated that the MBOT facility will serve as a catalyst  to stimulate a range of interdisciplinary studies on  rnicrostructures and nanodynamics.",
