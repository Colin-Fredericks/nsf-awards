 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to introduce the concepts of environmental analysis, monitoring, and management through remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. The project is also incorporating mapping concepts from digital images which serve as the spatial foundation for RS and GIS. Applications and student projects that are developing under this project stress special settings in an urban area such as Newark, New Jersey.   An example of a student project is to identify and map potential hazardous waste sites within the metropolitan area. For these objectives, there is a need for new RS software and equipment that is being installed in, and is expanding, the capabilities of the newly established PC-Laboratory.   The results of this project will directly affect the Civil and Environmental Engineering, Environmental Science, and Surveying Engineering Technology Departments. The laboratory will also serve students from neighboring Rutgers-Newark University and Essex County College. These higher education institutions have a cross-registration policy to minimize duplication of courses and to share resources. A substantial number of students at all of these institutions are inner city, first generation students.",
