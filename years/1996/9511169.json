A better understanding of the norms that govern the decisions of street-level bureaucrats would enhance our ability to make most effective use of the government.  This study seeks to discover under what conditions street-level government workers use recognizable norms of substantive justice to shape their allocative decisions and how that use is shaped through local work and identity-centered cultures.  It relies on data collected from stories of official interactions told by a carefully-selected sample of  bureaucrats over a period of time.  The story analysis is combined with intensive field work to learn how local work and identity cultures shape the management of justice-related decision-making dilemmas in particular settings.  %%%%  The official actions of street-level bureaucrats substantially influence the distribution of government goods and services.
