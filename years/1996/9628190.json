 "awd_abstract_narration": "Internet traffic is growing rapidly due to the immense popularity of the  World Wide Web and new multimedia services such as video-conferencing.  The increased traffic volume requires higher speed (Gigabit/sec or higher)  links, while some of the new traffic varieties (such as audio and video)  also demand quality-of-service guarantees.  This proposal addresses the  problem of providing high speed links by combining multiple low speed links  and performing load balancing.  It also address the problem of providing  quality of service guarantees for high speed links through the design of  efficient fair queuing algorithms.    The proposal is concerned with the design, evaluation, and implementation  of new and efficient fair queuing and load balancing algorithms.   Although  these two problems may look quite different at a first glance, the Pis show  that fair queuing algorithms can be converted into load balancing  algorithms using a time-reversal argument.    Existing mechanisms for fair queuing either are computationally expensive,  or they fail to provide the necessary service guarantees  (e.g., good  bounds on latency and throughput) required by many applications.  The PIs  develop a new fair queuing scheme called Tandem Clock Fair Queuing, which  offers quality-of-service guarantees comparable to those of the best  previous schemes (such as Weighted Fair Queuing), and yet appears to admit  efficient implementations.    Existing methods for load balancing provide inadequate load sharing in the  presence of variable length packets, and may result in non-FIFO delivery of  data if packet headers are not allowed to be modified.  The PIs describe  new load balancing schemes that solve these two problems by transforming  fair queuing schemes into load balancing schemes, and by using the twin  mechanisms of logical reception and sender simulation.    The investigators propose to refine and extend these new directions in fair  queuing and load balancing algorithms into complete and workable schem es  that can be deployed in the Internet and other real networks.  They plan to  evaluate and refine our schemes using a combination of mathematical  analysis, simulations, and actual implementation using a testbed.",
