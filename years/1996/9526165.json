 "awd_abstract_narration": "9526165  Xu    This research project uses a unique combination of precursor  molecular structure and reaction dynamics to conduct  deposition and growth studies of multi-component  ferroelectric oxides.  The investigation focuses on  autostoichiometric vapor depostion, which takes advantage of  the stoichiometrically associative double alkoxide  precursors, and deposition reactions that allow for the  conservation metal-to-metal ration during deposition.  Basic  understanding of various gas phase and surface reactions,  such as free-radical pyrolysis, hydrolysis-assisted  pyrolysis and hydrolysis-polycondensation, and their  implications on the stoichiometric nature of thin and thick  film deposition of ferroelectric materials.  Characterization methods employed include mass  spectrometric, X-ray, as well as optical scattering and loss  measurements of waveguide structures fabricated during the  project.  %%%  The knowledge and understanding gained from this research  project is expected to contribute in a general way to  improving the performance of advanced ferroelectric  materials and optoelectronic components used in computing,  information processing, and telecommunications by providing  a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and  producing improved materials.  An important feature of the  program is the integration of research and education through  the training of students in a fundamentally and  technologically significant area.  ***",
