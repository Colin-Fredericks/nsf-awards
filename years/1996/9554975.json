 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to restructure how parallel  programming is taught at universities.  Parallel programming  has been taught as a specialized topic at the senior and  graduate levels in research universities. However with the  growing importance of multiprocessor systems, it is now both  feasible and necessary to introduce parallel programming at  a much earlier stage and to a wider audience. This proposal  will investigate introducing parallel programming techniques  at the freshman year, integrating the material with existing  sequential programming classes. The introduction of parallel  programming techniques and their application will be  continued in a similar fashion throughout the undergraduate  curriculum wherever appropriate, in a gradual and  constructive way.  Introducing parallel programming at an earlier stage has two  major problems which will be addressed in his proposal.  First it requires special attention to dissemination and  integration of the material. Second it requires a suitable  computing platform. A major hindrance to teaching parallel  programming with large classes has been unavailability of  suitable computing platforms. Recent advances will be used  in networked workstations and parallel programming tools  which enable the workstations to be used collectively. How  such networks can be used effectively in a parallel  programming educational setting will be explored. New  educational material will be created, which will be made  freely available to other institutions. This proposal is  intended to influence not only computer science and  engineering curricula but also many aspects of other  disciplines, as programming and its application are widely  dispersed among many disciplines, including the physical  sciences, natural sciences, business, and commerce.",
