 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for the investigator's continued  research into the Rankin-Selberg method. Much of this work will  likely be joint work. The research will likely shift from the  search for new Rankin-Selberg integrals to extracting more  information from existing Rankin-Selberg constructions. An  initial problem will be the nonvanishing of the archimedean local  integrals for the symmetric cube L-functions on GL(2). Friedberg,  Hoffstein, and Bump have been exploring reflection groups coming  from double  Dirichlet series with automorphic L-functions on  GL(n) and quadratic characters. The corresponding question for  GL(2) and cubic characters will be studied. Other problems on  automorphic forms will be investigated.     This research falls  into the general mathematical field of Number Theory.  Number  theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole  numbers,  addressing such questions as those dealing with the  divisibility of one  whole number by another. It is among the  oldest branches of mathematics and  was pursued for many  centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within  the last  half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse   applications in areas such as data transmission and processing,  and  communication systems.",
