 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to the University of South Alabama supports an anthropological study of local participation in social movements that oppose polluting industries and other environmental hazards.  Using ethnographic as well as survey research methods in impacted communities and in activist groups, the researchers will examine how a cross-section of the region's residents perceive hazardous waste  and involve themselves in environmental rights movements.  Through ethnographic methods of in depth questioning and participant observation the project will seek to explain why environmental activism has been successful in some situations and never attempted in others.  The relation of the use of local rhetoric about environmental racism and the civil rights movement will be examined, as will the relation of property ownership and source of income to perceptions of risk from hazardous environmental materials.  This research is important theories of popular social mov \nem \nents have often lacked the in-depth information on motives, understanding and values that is available through ethnography.  Industrial and rural development have all too often been accompanied by environmental degradation.  By advancing our understanding of how local communities organize themselves to defend their environment, this project will provide valuable knowledge to industrial and environmental planners.",
