 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past two decades the importance of geometrical methods  in   the   analysis  of  complex  dynamical  systems  have   been  recognized.  With  the  advent  of high  speed  computers,  these  methods  are now being applied in a variety of fields.   Houever,  existing  courses in the undergraduate curriculum do not  utilize  these  powerful tools and only emphasize traditional methods  for  solving  differential  equations. This project  will  develop  an  innovative,   interdisciplinary   laboratory-based   course    on  nonlinear  dynamical  systems at the  undergraduate  level.   The  course  is designed to teach the geometrical methods of dynamical  systems  analysis  to  undergraduates  in  physics,  mathematics,  biology,  chemistry and the engineering sciences and to build  an  intuitive  understanding of the behavior of  such  systems.   The  innovative  aspects  of  the  course will  be  interdisciplinary,  experimental  laboratory exercises and applications of  computers  and  visualization  techniques.  A  significant  portion  of  the  development  effort  is  to create laboratory  experiments  which  complement course lectures.  These experiments are drawn  from  a  number   of   areas   of  dynamical  systems  theory,   including  applications  in physics, chemistry, biology and  electrical  and  civil  engineering.  The experiments are used  to  reinforce  the  material  learned  in  class  and to  illustrate  the  underlying  similarities between seemingly unrelated physical systems.   This  course  will  serve  as a model for other universities  and  will  produce  tested material that can be used to build the laboratory  component for similar courses.",
