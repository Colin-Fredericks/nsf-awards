Mr. Hamilton will work with Dr. Kenichi Okamoto,  director of the Global Environment Division, on a research  project entitled, \"Internet Techniques to Support the  Creation of a U.S.-Japan Science Data Information Exchange  System.\"    The project will study the data generated by Japanese  spaceborne remote sensors and devise methods to best  disseminate data via the internet to scientists in the  United States and throughout the world.  The research at CRL  will provide a special opportunity to learn about these  remote sensing technologies in order to best configure  remote sensing science data sets for internet transmittal.  Research will be specifically directed toward the data  collected by various advanced remote sensing technologies  being developed at CRL as well as the construction of remote  sensing data sets for international access and use.    The proposed research is of theoretical and practical  interest to the information systems community and the  benefits to be obtained from collaborative research will be  valuable to both participants.  The Communications Research  Laboratory is an outstanding research facility, and the  research will likely yield positive results for the United  States and Japan as well as the international scientific  community as a whole.  As such, the research satisfies the  objectives of the program in its emphasis on the exchange  and transfer of scientific knowledge through international  collaboration.  ***",
