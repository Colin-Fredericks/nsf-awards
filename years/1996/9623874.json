The  objective  is  to observe intrinsic optical bistability,  period-  doubling,  chaos  and  Rabi oscillations  in  wide  quantum  well  structures.  These  effects  have  recently  been  predicted   by  computer  simulations using the Hartree approximation which  have  modeled  quantum wells containing many electrons  and  which  are  subject  to intense Terahertz radiation. The experiments will  be  performed  using  the  UC  Santa  Barbara  Free-Electron   Laser.  Semiconductor  structures which are specially  tailored  for  the  quantum  chaos  experiments will be grown  and  characterized  in  collaboration with collaborators at UC Santa Barbara.  %%%  In  recent  years,  many investigators have  been  struggling  to  reconcile  quantum  mechanics with  the  existence  of  chaos  in  Newtonian  dynamics.  The field is called  'quantum  chaos'.  The  traditional  approach to 'quantum chaos' is to study the  quantum  mechanics  of systems whose classical dynamics are chaotic.  This  project  takes  a somewhat different approach and  focuses  on  a  search for a purely quantum mechanical version of chaotic motion.  That is, motion that is chaotic, but has no analogue in classical  mechanics.  The  system to be studied are electrons  confined  in  thin  layers of semiconductor quantum wells, and which are driven  by extremely strong fields which oscillate several trillion times  each second. Simulations indicate that such systems can exhibit a  chaotic motion with no classical analogue. The strong fields  are  generated  by UC Santa Barbara's unique Free-Electron Laser.  The  project  will  initially  seek to observe  precursors  of  chaos,  called bifurcations, in which a small change in a parameter  (for  example, the strength of the oscillating field) causes a dramatic  change   in  the character of motion. A bifurcation  of  immediate  interest  is  so-called \"period-doubling\", in which the  system's  oscillations  occur  at twice the period of oscillations  in  the  driving  field. Having found such bifurcations, the project  will  then seek chaotic motion in a quantum system.  ***",
