 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the travel of 12 Americans from academe and industry, including four advanced graduate students and/or postdoctoral researchers, to a U.S.-European workshop on crystal growth modeling to be held in Durbuy, Belgium, October 1996.  The co-organizers are Jeffrey J. Derby of the University of Minnesota and Francois Dupret of Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium.  Other participants include university- and industry-based scientists from Europe as well as Japan.  The objectives of the workshop are to identify common priorities, exchange new ideas and promote future collaborative work among the participants.  Their focus is the development and application of mathematical modeling to crystal growth.  The growth of crystalline materials ranges from the one-time creation of single-crystal protein pharmaceuticals to the annual production of metric tons of electronic-grade silicon for industrial use.  Successful growth of a variety of crystals of exacting quality for broad applications may be addressed through mathematical modeling.  This workshop will advance understanding of the use of mathematical modeling for the growth of a variety of crystals.",
