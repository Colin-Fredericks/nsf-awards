 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first goal of this investigation is a software  development strategy in which ultra-modular executable  specifications are the starting point of systems design. By  ultra-modular is meant a set of specific technologies that  allow one to anticipate and realize change, including the  use of domain-specific embedded languages to capture high-  level, domain-specific semantics, and modular monadic  interpreters on which to realize the semantics and  associated software tools. Using these techniques a level of  modularity in software is obtained that has not been  achieved before: namely, modularity at the meta-level of  abstract semantics. Second, the research seeks a notion of  type-based modularity to capture software architecture.  There is a misconception that type systems are contrary to  the goals of \"dynamic languages,\" which in turn are viewed  as good candidates for building evolvable systems. This  research contests this claim. In fact it is expected that  modern typed languages such as ML and Haskell can offer even  greater support for constructing reliable and efficient  evolutionary software. In particular,  the design and use of  a higher-order module language is studied to capture systems  architecture. Finally, a methodology is investigated that  supports the notion of incremental derivations.  In this  methodology, some executable specifications are refined for  improved performance, whether by formal methods (program  transformation, partial evaluation, etc.) or by informal  methods (such as rewriting inner loops in a lower-level  language). The key point is that the derivations themselves  can be modularized, thus making them suitable candidates for  smooth evolution.  When formal methods are employed, this  also yields a technique for constructing modular proofs of  program correctness; yet another innovative aspect of this  approach. These three ideas form the cornerstone of the  research effort. To evaluate them, the investigation  includes the design of a prototype extens ible operating  system.  ***",
