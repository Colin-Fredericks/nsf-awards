 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9633594  Lindell    This research will assess differences in the extent to which  social units located in areas with different levels of  seismic vulnerability vary in their adoption of earthquake  hazard adjustments, and also will identify variables  predicting these differences in adoption behavior. The study  will examine measures that function actively (preparedness),  as well as passively (mitigation), at the time of earthquake  impact to minimize deaths, injuries, property damage, and  loss of function. The study will involve two different types  of social units--households and complex organizations, with  the latter category divided into private businesses and  government agencies. Government agencies will be divided  further into those with an emergency component  in their  mission statements (e.g., fire and police departments,  emergency management offices) and those without such a  component (city manager's offices, finance departments,  social services, etc.). The research project also will  address characteristics of the physical and social  environment affecting each of these types of social units.  Variations in the physical environment will be examined by  studying social units at high (southern California) and  medium (western Washington) seismic risk.***",
