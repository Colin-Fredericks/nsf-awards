 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632634  GIFFORD  The specific focus of this project will be to describe  quantitatively the contribution of nano- and microplankton (i.e.,  plants and animala, 2-200 um in size) prey fields to recruitment of  target copepod populations on Georges Bank. The PIs hypothesize  that early stage copepods advected onto the Bank from the Gulf of  Maine and the Great South Channel experience an enriched food  environment on-Bank relative to source regions. The project will  examine consumption of nano- and microplankton by naupliar stages  N3-N6 of the calanoid copepods Calanus finmarchicus and  Pseudocalanus spp. in:  1) source areas in the Great South Channel  and the Gulf of Maine where the advective regime contributes water  (and presumably copepods) to Georges Bank; 2) on-Bank regions  receiving these inputs, including the region  of enhanced  production on the Northeast Peak; and 3) areas on either side of  the tidal front separating the Bank crest from deeper waters on the  Southern Flank. The study focuses on Calanus and Pseudocalanus  because these species dominate the zooplankton biomass of Georges  Bank during the January-June period. Naupliar stages will be  studied because these are the stages at which copepods recruit to  the population.  Field sampling will be conducted in the Great  South Channel and southern Gulf of Maine because these are sites  for advective inputs of water and zooplankton onto the Bank crest.  This project is a part of the U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field  Studies, Phase 2 program.  ***",
