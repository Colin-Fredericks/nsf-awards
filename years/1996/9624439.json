 "awd_abstract_narration": "NOTE: This CAREER award is a companion project to the CAREER  award CCR-96-24560, ``Practice-Oriented Provable Security'',  University of California, Davis. This project focuses on the  areas of (1) provable security and probabilistic proof  checking with orientation towards developing practical, but  proven secure protocols and (2) probabilistic proof checking  (PCP) with application to the derivation of  nonapproximability results for NP-hard optimization  problems. The problems examined cannot be solved by some  kind of ``technology transfer'' from theory to practice;  rather the theoretical principles have to be used to develop  new models and solve new problems.  Applications of the  techniques of practice-oriented provable security are  applied to such problems as: session key distribution, use  of block cyphers to provably achieve basic cryptographic  goals, and balancing between individual privacy and law  enforcement, via key escrow or other means.  In the area of  PCP, the problems studied include determining tight results  for the approximability of Max Clique, and improved results  for Max SNP problem. The Integrated Educational Plan of this  CAREER grant includes developing: (a) new undergraduate and  graduate courses in principles of sound protocol design,  with joint university/industrial training projects; and (b)  an undergraduate algorithm design course in which proof  checking tehniques for determining good approximate  solutions are taught and applied to NP-hard optimization  problems.***",
