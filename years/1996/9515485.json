Shields of the University of Toledo and Imre Csiszar and Katalin Marton of the Mathematical Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, will examine finite-alphabet processes in which both information theory and ergodic theory play a role.  The intent is to investigate theoretical possibilities of data compression and the performance of data compression algorithms for classes of processes.  The researchers also will study related structural problems of processes, including very weak Bernoulli processes by employing a \"blowing-up\" property for independent processes.  This joint effort will build upon the U.S. partner's strengths in ergodic theory and the Hungarian strengths in information theory and statistics.  Results are expected to enhance information theory applicable to multi-user processes and conditional measures.    This mathematics project in modern analysis fulfills the program objective of advancing basic scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the Untied States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of mutual interest and competence.    ??",
