 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514160  Zagare    This investigation refines and extends a generic two-stage escalation model of incomplete information.  In this game-theoretic model, Defender is provided with two distinct ways (other than outright capitulation) to resist a challenge.  The Challenger is unsure of Defender's willingness to resist either by responding-in-kind or by escalating.  Previous examinations of this model find that the status quo is almost as tenuous under policies that requires flexibility at the local level as it is under deployment policies that rely completely on strategic threats to deter aggression.  Limited conflicts are most likely in the policy space between the extremes of Massive Retaliation and Flexible Response.    The research  generalizes and extends the underlying models to explore certain theoretical issues raised in the course of  the investigator's prior research, and moves it toward an empirical test.  To increase model verisimilitude, Defender's capability is treated as a variable, the number of conflict stages are increased, the sub-strategic options available to Defender expanded, Defender's decision-making separated at each stage, and the asymmetry assumption dropped.  The end result is a firmer understanding of how acute interstate crises can be managed, how escalation can be controlled, when and why extended deterrence works and, especially, how limited conflicts can be kept limited.  The breakup of the Soviet Union and the subsequent disintegration of the Warsaw Pact heightens both the significance and urgency of these important policy problems.  ***",
