This   workshop will produce a Phase II Start-Up Grant proposal to the   Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) that will   consider the ecology of forests, their role in the formation and change of   the global climate, how human activities influence forests, what social   value might be assigned to forests, and what policy changes would be   necessary to manage the forests as a 'sustainable' resource.  The Phase II proposal will suggest the construction of a dynamic   optimization model for forest management that incorporates the concept of   forests as social capital assets.  Many models either have ignored social   benefits as intangibles, or have simply considered the forest's stumpage   and amenity values.  Remaining stock is often considered as providing no   benefits or as not being an asset (essentially, these models consider   forest resources to be infinite, because within the models, human activity   does not affect the remaining forest's value).  In addition, most models   simply assume that the only decision to be made is how much to cut.  This   model will attempt to assign an opportunity cost to the cutting.  By   including these ecological and social costs, the model will hopefully lead   to a better informed decision on when to cut, how much to  cut, and when to   stop cutting.  The workshop will use a large set of existing data on boreal forests in   Canada and the United States, including those from the BOREAS program, to   determine some of the valuations described above.  The Phase II proposal   will attempt validation exercises, and try to determine the valuations in   the context of Costa Rican and Brazilian forests.  This proposal assembles a team of scientists from the following countries:   Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, and the United States.  These countries are   Member States of the IAI, an initiative to stimulate cooperative research   on global change issues among the scientific institutions of the Americas.   The National Science Foundation is the designated U.S. Government agency to   carry out the United States' responsibilities within the IAI.  %%%  This workshop will consider the value of forests to human society, and   investigate methods for better management of forest resources.

Remaining stock is often considered as providing no   benefits or as not being an asset.  In addition, most models simply assume   that the only decision to be made is 'how much to cut.'  This model will   attempt to assign an cost to the cutting, because the reduced amount of   forest produces a reduced amount o f benefit - less recreational space, less   carbon absorbed, higher evaporative loss of fresh water, greater   contamination of reservoirs, etc.  By including these ecological and social   costs, the model will hopefully lead to a better informed decision on when   to cut, how much to cut, and when to stop cutting.
