 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Marian Stankovich, Department of Chemistry, University of Minnesota,   Twin Cities, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division to enable graduate   students to attend the `International Conference on Oxygen Intermediates   in Nonheme Metallobiochemistry` at the University of Minnesota on June   23-27, 1996. The conference will be the first international gathering to   deal exclusively with the topic of oxygen intermediates of nonheme   biological systems and their inorganic models.   Nonheme proteins and   enzymes play key roles in such diverse functions as environmental   detoxification, synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides,  synthesis and   interconversion of amino acids in mammalian metabolism, protection of   organisms from damage by activated oxygen species, and oxygen transport.  This conference will provide an opportunity for graduate students and   faculty, working in an important area of chemistry involving the function   of metal ions in biological systems, to share their results and   experiences in the field.  A fundamental understanding of these systems   is important because these proteins and enzymes play key roles in diverse   functions such as environmental detoxification and mammalian metabolism,   which impact human health and aging, either directly or indirectly,   through their impact on the environment.",
