Candidates with background in India are  screened and nominated by AIIS before referral to NSF for final  selection.  The AIIS manages the required clearances for the  research, the logistics involved in travel, local arrangements  and the conduct of research in India.  Areas of research  typically include anthropology, linquistics, sociology,  economics, political sciences, as well as biology, mathematics  and engineering.  The US-India program supports US scholarly  research in India in areas of interest to NSF where the research  may be a vehicle for improved bilateral understanding through  science.     Scope:  The AIIS is a consortium of more than forty-eight leading  American colleges and universities with South Asian or Indian  Studies programs.  The Institute's principal activity is the  awarding of fellowships to support scholarly research on India by  senior scientists, postdocs, and graduate students.  Applicants  are careful screened and reviewed by panels of eminent scientists  at AIIS, and then referred to NSF for disciplinary review and  final selection.  The AIIS offices in New Dehli and other major  cities in India have well-established contacts with Government of  India departments and can facilitate US scientists   collaborations with host institutions.          ***",
