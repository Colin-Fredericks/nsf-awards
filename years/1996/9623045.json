 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for an investigation that comprises two subprojects  in Number Theory; the common unifying theme is representation of  real numbers in  non-integer bases. The first subproject concerns  problems in uniform  distribution. The major problem under  consideration is higher dimensional normality. The \"bases\" become  n by n matrices and the \"numbers\" become points in n-dimensional  space. The problem has been completely resolved by Brown and  Moran for commuting (almost) ergodic matrices. The investigator  is, in collaboration with Moran, attacking the non-commuting  case. Another  problem in this subproject is Mahler's question on  uniform distribution of the sequence consisting of a real number  x times powers of 3/2. The  second subproject concerns  approximation spectra. The investigation is dealing with two  problems on this topic. The first is the conjecture of  Barnes  and Swinnerton-Dyer on inhomogeneous minima of quadratic forms.  They conjecture that the maximum of the inhomogeneous minima  occurs at a rational point and is isolated. The second problem  concerns higher dimensional  approximation spectra. The  investigator and J. Lagarias have recently  shown that the  Markoff spectrum can be obtained from the Szekeres  continuous  algorithm in a natural way. They are attempting to use a similar   analysis of the appropriate continuous algorithm to obtain new  information about the two (and higher) dimensional approximation  constant.    This research falls into the general mathematical  field of Number Theory.  Number theory has its historical roots  in the study of the whole numbers,  addressing such questions as  those dealing with the divisibility of one  whole number by  another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and  was  pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However,  within  the last half century it has become an indispensable tool  in diverse  applications in areas such as data transmission and  processing, and  communication systems.  Th e higher dimensional  rational approximation  techniques used in this project are of  significant interest for  intelligence applications.",
