McNamara    The proposed research will (1) investigate the long term behavior and energetics of the low mass X-  ray binary (LMXB) Sco X-1  (2) recruit highly qualified minority undergraduates into the space  sciences (3) involve minority undergraduate science and engineering  students in two NASA  programs and (4) recruit two undergraduate minority students into the astronomy program at NMSU .  The project will use X-ray data obtained  by the Compton Gamma- Ray Observatory and the X-ray  Timing Explorer as well as optical data obtained at Cerro Tololo InterAmerican Observatory  and  New Mexico State University. The primary research goal is to obtain a multi-year record of  the high  energy flux and x-ray color of the LMXB Sco X-1 to search for expected long term emission  variations from this system. The high energy data sets will also be combined with optical data to  better understand this system s energetics.                                                                                                                                                                            Abstract                                                 HRD -9628568                                                 University of Texas at El Paso ---E.Walsh                                                    This RIMI  project will attempt to  provide a  cladistic phylogeny of the major planktonic families  using  a molecular approach. The goals of the proposed research are to (1) isolate, amplify and  sequence  nuclear ribosomal  DNA from representatives of 13 families of the monogonont rotifers,  (2)  determine the sister group  of the monogononts by obtaining comparable data from four  bdelloids and a seisonid, (3) construct cladograms and develop phylogenetic hypotheses  using  molecular characters (4) compare these results with tree topologies derived from morphological  characters and (5) evaluate the placement of the Rotifera within the ex isting  metazoan phylogenies  based on 18S rDNA sequences. The phylogenetic hypotheses generated by the proposed research can  be used to further  resolve relationships among rortifers. They will constitute a basis from which to  incorporate a historical component into understanding questions of broader evolutionary significance.  In addition, the relationships among rotifers and other  pseudo coelomate taxa will be explored.

Mutants will be studied to help determine these requirements. The  RIMI project will focus on the characterizations mutants isolated in the laboratory  on the basis of   their hypersensitivities to killing by ionizing radiation, H2O2 , and a radiomimetic  family of  chemical congeners. This approach will  acquire knowledge from interrelated studies at the cellular  and molecular levels, using genetic characterizations, molecular biology and biochemistry, DNA  sequence analyses, methodologies for studying DNA damage and repair / transmission  and scanning  electron microscopy. Cloning and characterizing the blm mutants will enable their relationship to  already characterized genes to be determined  and seems likely to add new knowledge of general  importance to fields of DNA repair , metabolism and genetics. A variety of research training  experiences will be provided for students at all levels of education including postdoctoral, graduate,  undergraduate, and high school.

This facility will be  available to all Meharry researchers. Specific research projects critically dependent on nucleic acid  and protein analyses to be directly supported by  this initiative are (1) identification of motifs that  contribute to structure and function of hetero chromatin; (2) analysis of primary structure and folding  patterns of RNA and its effects on viral recombination and replication; and (3) analysis of structural  effects of site- directed mutations on flavin-containing monooxygenase.

McKenna        Support is sought for the acquisition and installation of controlled environment growth chambers in  the biology department greenhouse. The addition of these chambers will significantly increase  research capabilities in plant science, aid in recruitment of talented undergraduates , graduate students  and new faculty, and provide a facility that can support precollege outreach programs designed  to  increase the entry of minority students in science careers. The installation of controlled environment  chambers will extend and enhance ongoing research in the areas of plant anatomy and development,  phytoremediation, plant ecophysiology, plant ecology , plant systematics, mycology, plant molecular  biology and genetics . The facility will allow the institution to maintain experimental plant populations  over long periods, maintain clones or plant families for genetic experiments , grow source material  for cellular and molecular experiments including tissue culture, DNA analysis, and phytoremediation,  maintain plants for systematic study , and design experiments under controlled environmental  conditions to study cellular, physiological or ecological processes.

Studies that utilize molecular biological methods  regularly produce data that need to be analyzed by comparison against large databases of existing  sequences for similarities. pattern searching algorithms are used to unveil nonrandom sequence  features that may be of  biological relevance. Two computer workstations will be used to carry out  molecular sequence analysis using the Intelligenetics Suite, a comprehensive molecular biology  software package providing access to sequence databases worldwide and a broad spectrum of  sequence analysis tools. The second half of the Computational  Biology Facility will  focus on  cellular anatomy and physiology. Characterization of  cellular morphology is critical, for  understanding physiological function.  Confocal microscopy permits the examination of cellular  morphology in three dimensions.
