 "awd_abstract_narration": "This purpose of this research is to increase our understanding of  the economics of the inner city.  The common theme of this  project is that the poverty of the urban underclass is intimately  connected to, and even a result of, a dearth of positive social  interactions and role models.  This project has three sections.  The first primarily involves data collection.  The second  presents a concrete attempt to answer a crucial question in  America's cities: Why is there more crime in big cities?  The  third is primarily theoretical and methodological .    The first section will help to explain why ghettos are so  pervasive, despite their many problems.  The primary goal is to  build a century long data set on segregation by city, and when  possible by SMSA, for ethnic and racial groups.  Comprehensive  data on ghettos is itself a serious contribution, but this data  will also help determine why ghettos came about and why they  persist so much longer for African-Americans than for other  immigrant groups.  Micro-evidence will be developed as to why  ghettos are initially appealing, but end up being costly for  their settlers' descendants.    The second section will examine why crime is so much higher in  big cities than in small cities or in the hinterland.  Evidence  gathered so far ensures that the city effect increasing crime is  real and not merely a statistical artifact coming from more crime  prone individuals living in cities.  The urban crime effect is  also not the result of the poor being close to the rich in  crowded cities.  Less than 10% of the effect comes from lower  probabilities of arrest in big cities.  Approximately 20% comes  from higher returns to crime in cities.  Of the remaining 70%,  45% can be connected to variables describing family structure in  large cities.  This work also documents urban anonymity.    The last section addresses the empirical puzzle of the strikingly  large range of urban crime rates-- the variance of actual crime  rates is much larger than the varia nce of crime rates that would  be predicted based on the differences in other attributes across  cities.  This high variance is incompatible with individuals  making decisions about crime independently: there must be social  interactions.  A formal model connecting social interactions with  the variance of urban crime rates is used to create a natural  index of the degree of social interactions.  This index shows  that murder and rape have few interactions, but that larceny and  auto theft are highly interactive.  The research will use the  time patterns in urban crime rates, drug use and migration to  further examine the size and nature of social interactions.",
