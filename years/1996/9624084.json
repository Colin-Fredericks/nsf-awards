 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Roanoke River Valley Consortium (R2VC), consists of five  predominately African American disadvantaged school systems  (Bertie, 78%; Hertford, 73%; Northampton, 79%; Warren, 77%; Weldon  City, 98%) located in rural poverty-stricken Northern North  Carolina.  Poverty has a reverberating effect on these children and  their families, and also on these school systems where the students  are in attendance.  To decrease the gap between these disadvantages  school systems and advantaged systems, the R2VC proposes to  implement a comprehensive regional science and mathematics K-12  project entitled Partnerships to Enhance Student Achievement  (PESA).  The goal of PESA is to implement systemic approaches to  increase the number of minority students enrolling in a  successfully completing precollege courses essential to preparation  for collegiate science and mathematics.  To achieve this goal, an  overview of the objectives are as follows: to deliver quality  instruction and to sustain interventions in school science and  mathematics education for minority students that will result in a  significant increase in those who graduate and who are academically  prepared to enter college and major in the sciences, mathematics,  or engineering; to substantially decrease tracking and improve  academic counseling to facilitate the successful transition of  minority students from elementary to middle and from middle to high  school into undergraduate programs in SMET; to stimulate efforts  among secondary schools and colleges and universities, as well as  relevant informal science organizations (e.g., museums, aquaria,  etc.); to develop summer enrichment activities; to stimulate  efforts to establish mentorship programs among professional  organizations, business, and industry and network with programs  supported by the federal and private sector to avoid duplication,  to share resources, and to maximize available funding; to stimulate  the involvement of parents and guardians and the business community  throu gh partnerships in all aspects of the students' education; and  to function in a complementary and collaborative manner with other  funded educational activities (i.e., NSF,EPA, NIH, UDOE, etc.)  through continuous dialogue.    PESA has four major components: (1) staff development for educators  (i.e., teachers, counselors, administrators); (2) student  enrichment opportunities including field-trips, Saturday Seminars,  Leadership Conference, career counseling, mentorships, Summer  Enrichment Institute, and a challenging high school course of study  (Ronald McNair Academy); (3) parental partnerships; and (4)  business/industry partnerships.    With support from the N.C. State Department of Public Instruction,  Elizabeth City State University, North Carolina Central University,  University of N.C. at Chapel Hill and business/industry, through  memorandums of partnerships, this project will influence each  entire school system in the areas of curriculum reform, curriculum  enhancement, teacher enhancement, strategic use of resources,  student enrichment activities, and summer enrichment activities.   The curriculum shall be enhanced through such activities as Family  Math, Family Science, Science and Technology for Children (K-5),  Science and Technology Program (6-8), the Bob Moses Algebra  Project, EQUALS, and the Ronald McNair Academy (9-12).  Teachers  shall upgrade their skills through training in the aforementioned  areas as well as Gender/Equity Expectations for Student  Achievement.  In addition, teachers will be encouraged to accept  summer internships in business/industry, higher education and  federal agencies such as NASA and EPA.  The students will be  provided expanded opportunities in science and math.  These  activities consist of the following: Super Stars (K-5); Math Counts  (6-8);  Bob Moses Algebra Project (6-8); Student Challenge (9);  Summer Enrichment Institute (9); Math Science Education Network  Seminars (10); Math/Science Leadership conference (11); Mentorships  (12); and  Ronald McNair Academy course of study (9-12).  Parents  will be encouraged and supported in the establishment of a parent  Partnership Program to function as a resource to the school systems  and to enhance their involvement in their children's education.      The evidence of program effectiveness in schools and classrooms  used for validation by the National Diffusion Program Effectiveness  panel shall be used for evaluation.  The program effectiveness  areas are specified in claim types.  They are as follows:  Claim  Type 1, Academic Achievement; Claim Type 2, Teacher Learning  Process; Claim Type 3, Positive Change Student; and Claim Type 4,  Instructional Delivery.  The evaluation results will show  institutionalization os systemic changes which will result in an  increase in minority students enrollment in and successful  completion of precollege courses in science and mathematics;  minority student academic performance; minority students choosing  careers in science and mathematics; teachers using innovative  instructional and motivational strategies; parental involvement;  business/industry partnerships; and, utilization of available  resources to enhance instruction.  The results of implementing PESA  will depict a project that can be implemented in whole or in part  to meet the needs of students in rural and/or urban areas.  ***",
