For the past two years, AAAS, AAAS affiliated societies, and their counterparts in the newly independent states (NIS) of the former Soviet Union have been implementing a program to enhance scientific infrastructure-building activities in these states.  The goals of this program are to: (1) assist NIS counterparts in development of decision-making processes in science institutions which are based on competition, peer review, and democratic norms, and which promote the advancement of science and the public understanding of scientific issues; (2) encourage the development of nongovernmental scientific societies whose members cut across research, educational, and industrial sectors of the scientific community; and (3) enhance US scientists' understanding of NIS science and promote cooperation between US and NIS scientists including the open exchange of scientific information.  AAAS has also been acting as a clearinghouse of information about other US and European programs in NIS states to foster better coordination and understanding of these efforts.  Economic constraints and the closed culture of many of these new states have resulted in major divisions and difficulties in the scientific community and have impeded its progress toward institutions more akin to Western norms.  AAAS plans to continue and intensify its infrastructure-building activities in this region over the next year by: (1) Conducting two workshops on proposal-writing skills and two follow-on workshops on project management and evaluation; (2) Assisting in the development of nongovernmental scientific societies through five additional fellowships and by supporting some of these fellows on a longer-term basis to assist in the establishment of sustainable nongovernmental scientific societies; and (3) intensifying its cl earinghouse function by continuing to collect and disseminate information, in written and electronic form, on US and European scientific and technical programs in NIS states and on NIS science institutions and their activities.     This clearinghouse fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and the NIS to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.      ??",
