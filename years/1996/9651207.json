 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project expands and develops the Cartography and Remote Sensing Laboratory. The increased number of computers, advanced software, and peripheral equipment allows for more hands-on experience for undergraduate students enrolled in remote sensing, cartography, and geographic information systems (GIS) courses in the analysis of satellite imagery, creation of spatial databases, mapping, and the use of GIS. Rapid advances in both software and hardware have provided students and faculty with powerful new tools to address environmental issues, urban and regional planning problems, and the modeling of the Earth's physical systems, as well as enabling students to work in innovative areas such as animation and interactive mapping and to develop their knowledge of the nature of spatial data and its presentation. Sophisticated software in remote sensing and GIS gives students exciting tools for creating and analyzing spatial data, for the analysis of radar imagery, for the creation of three-dimensional models, and for the use of statistical algorithms for image classification and enhancement.    The enlargement and modernization of the laboratory not only results in the improvement of the laboratory experience, but also enables more students to be included in the existing courses, improves the content of the courses, and expands the current course offerings in these areas. The impact of the laboratory improvements on student performance, as well as satisfaction with the program, curricular offerings, and enrollment are being carefully monitored. Results can be presented at professional conferences and then submitted as an article to a professional journal. The article can detail the impact of the new equipment and software on the program and can include suggestions for the development of similar laboratory facilities.",
