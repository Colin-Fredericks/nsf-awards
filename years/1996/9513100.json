Burghardt of the University of  Tennessee-Knoxville and Dr. Akira Mori of Kyoto University.  The collaborators assembled also include Dr. Richard Goris  at the Yokohama City University School of Medicine and  biologists specializing on reptile chemical ecology in the  USA.  This project will investigate the structure and  function of a remarkable nuchal venom gland in a Japanese  natricine snake.  The problem is how the snake synthesizes  and uses this complex chemical stew of potent toxins, which  seem to be unique to this species and some relatives.  Since  related toxins are found in the skin of favored prey of this  species, amphibians, it is possible that the venom derives  from chemicals sequestered from the diet of the animal.  This has not been demonstrated in any amniote vertebrate to  date, although many eat potentially toxic amphibians.  Neonatal snakes seem to have an undeveloped gland and the  ontogeny of the system will be explored through a series of  experiments.  The behavior of the snakes towards potential  predators and responses of such animals to the toxins will  also be explored in noninjurious tests.  The project brings  together workers in behavior, development, snake venoms, and  histology from two countries.  This proposal fulfills the  objectives of the Program in its joint endeavor bringing  state of the art methods from two countries into a joint  international collaborative effort.  ***",
