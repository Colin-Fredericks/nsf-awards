 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632960  Steinberg  This project will test a new concept that may lead to early  detection of tumors in breasts by echo ultrasound.  Early  detection by ultrasound or any other imaging modality  requires high spatial resolution and high contrast  resolution.  Modern ultrasound systems can detect objects as  small as  1 mm when used in the hands of skilled operators.  Contrast  resolution of ultrasound is excellent relative to x-ray  mammography (the gold standard for breast cancer screening  tests), and ultrasound is used in distinguishing dense  breast tumors from clear, liquid-filled cysts, provided the  cysts are large enough to be distinguished from noise  (speckle) in the image.  Therefore, contrast resolution  becomes the ultimate limiting factor in high quality echo  ultrasound. The elimination of speckle is the goal of the  project.    This project addresses contrast resolution and offers a way  materially to improve it using a novel, automatic signal  processor instrument with real-time potential.  The  instrument, which was developed during a radar study of 3-D  high resolution imagery, has strong potential for  discriminating between soft breast tissue and dense tissue  typical of lesions (tumors).  Success with the project would  provide the ability of ultrasound systems to detect breast  cancer at an earlier stage and therefore improve the  probability of long term survival.    This award is made under the guidelines applicable to Small  Grants for Exploratory Research.  ***",
