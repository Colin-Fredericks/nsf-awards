The first  group investigates the fundamental mechanisms underlying film  growth by chemical vapor deposition, with a focus on the growth  of Si and Ge and their alloys.  The second group focuses on the  role that grain boundaries and the electronic structure play in  determining the critical current density of polycrystalline high  temperature superconductors.  The third group addresses the  fabrication, characterization, and understanding of the  properties of perovskite-like magnetic oxides with potential  device applications.  The MRSEC supports shared experimental  facilities for materials research, exploratory research through  seed funding, and collaborations with industry and with other  universities.  Educational outreach programs include development  of instructional materials for high school science teachers and  outreach visits to local schools.  The Center supports 15 senior  investigators, 8 postdoctoral research associates, 16 graduate  students, 7 technicians or other professionals, and 10  undergraduates.  The MRSEC is directed by Professor T. F. Kuech.  %%%  The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) on  Nanostructured Materials and Interfaces at the University of  Wisconsin, Madison supports research in three interdisciplinary  groups.
