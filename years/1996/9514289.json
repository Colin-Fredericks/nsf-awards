Yet relatively little is known  about the basic mechanisms by which  cells maintain and propagate peroxisomes and direct specific sets  of newly synthesized proteins to these organelles (peroxisome  biogenesis). Recent studies indicate that peroxisome biogenesis  mechanisms are novel and not simply variations of those in other  organelles. A molecular genetic investigation of peroxisomes has  been initiated using a methanol-utilizing yeast, Pichia pastoris,  as a model system. This yeast was selected because: (1)  peroxlsomes are required for its growth on either methanol or  oleic acid, phenotypes that are easily observed, and (2) the  organelles are large and numerous in cells grown on these  substrates. In the previous grant period, a number of  peroxisome-deficient (per) mutants of P. pastoris were isolated,  and significant progress was made in the cloning and  characterization of several of the affected PER genes.    This proposal is aimed at elucidating the structure and function  of two very interesting P. pastoris PER gene products, Per3p and  Per6p.  Per3p is an 81-kDa membrane-associated protein that  appears to be located on the inner surface of the peroxisomal  membrane. Per3p is involved in import of peroxisomal matrix  enzymes and may be composed of multiple domains required for the  function of different peroxisomal import pathways. To test this  multi-domain hypothesis and to define the approximate location of  the domains, mutations will be introduced into PER3, and their  effects on the function of specific import pathways will be  determined. Per3p is one of only a few peroxisomal import  machinery components that has been identified. To identify other  import components, the two-hybrid protein method will be used to  search for proteins that interact with Per3p. These studies will  provide valuable insights into the role of P er3p in protein import  and into the identity and organization of other components of the  import machinery.    Per6p is a 52-kDa peroxisomal integral membrane protein that has  similarity to PAFlp, a protein affected in certain patients with  the peroxisomal biogenesis disorder Zellweger syndrome. Although  it is suspected that these proteins are involved in peroxisomal  protein import, direct evidence for this is lacking. To obtain  such evidence for Per6p, temperature-sensitive per6 strains will  be shifted to nonpermissive temperature, and the fate of import of  newly synthesized (pulse-labeled) peroxisomal proteins will be  examined. If Per6p is required for the import, import should  rapidly cease after shift. Peroxisomal targeting signals (PTSs)  have been identified for matrix proteins but not for peroxisomal  integral membrane proteins. To identify PTS sequences in Per6p,  selected NH2- and COOH-terminally truncated derivatives of the  protein will be synthesized in P. pastoris and examined for proper  targeting. Defining a PTS for membrane proteins is a critical  first step in understanding how cells target and insert this class  of proteins into the peroxisomal membrane.  ***",
