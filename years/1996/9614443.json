 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9614443  Cohen  With the recent dynamic expansion of the National and Global  Information Infrastructures, the activities of larger, more  diverse communities are becoming integrated. Because of  this, there is great need to understand how trust develops  among people acting together in computer-mediated ways. This  project will empirically investigate how people generate and  maintain trust in task groups working within networked,  computer-mediated environments.  It will compare results  from face-to-face experimental conditions, with results  obtained from groups working via networked computers that  provide \"desktop conferencing\" video connections, and  results on groups working via the World Wide Web without  video support. Two significant products are expected. First,  the research will provide valuable experimental evidence on  whether and how computer mediation affects the development  of trust as work groups learn task routines. Second, it will  provide extensive development and demonstration of new tools  and methods for the conduct of scientific experiments on the  integration and impacts of information technology via the  World Wide Web. These include tools and methods for  recruitment of subjects, scheduling, instruction,  experimental task performance, post-session questioning, and  payment. This promises to help open the Web at large as an  active research tool and environment.  ***",
