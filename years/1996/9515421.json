 "awd_abstract_narration": "9515421  Kalai    This project studies issues in rational interactive social  learning.  This includes learning in long term strategic  interaction, e.g., firms engaged in market competition, and in  recurring short interactions, e.g., real estate transactions  involving different buyer-seller pairs.  It develops further  theoretical results and applies the theoretical findings to  specific problems in economics.  The theoretical developments  include the following subjects: (1) asymptotic accuracy of  forecasts as captured by notions of merging; (2) testing forecast  performance using past realization as done by notions of  calibration; (3) relationships between merging and calibration;  and (4) economic and game-theoretic calibrated forecasts.  The  applications include the following issues: (1) how long-term  learning affects classical models of industrial organization,  e.g., pricing, bargaining and auctions; (2) how social learning  can be guided to bring about social efficiency;  (3) developing  long-term implementation schemes; and (4) developing tests that  enable experimentalist to determine, based only on observed past  realizations, whether a long-run or recurring equilibrium is  being played.",
