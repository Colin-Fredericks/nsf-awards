 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project probes a variation geometric modeling and analysis framework based on concepts embodied in finite element analysis.  A procedural interpretation of geometric dimensioning and tolerance information is formed as the stiffness matrix, loads and material properties in order to create feature variation in size, position, orientation, and form.  The goal is to provide a standardized mathematical basis for comprehensive, three-dimensional tolerance analysis.  The inclusion of structural deformations, thermal expansion, the discretized synergy with coordinate measuring systems, the embodiment of robust design, and its intuitive conceptual appeal is expected to advance the field of variation dimensional management and simultaneous engineering.   This innovation will enable the engineering of three-dimensional objects (virtual parts) for optimal tolerance allocation.  Commercial applications are anticipated in many manufacturing functions, including robust product design, simultaneous engineering, rapid prototyping, cost reduction and quality enhancement, computer aided tolerance analysis, and optimization for the design and manufacture of mechanical and electrical systems.",
