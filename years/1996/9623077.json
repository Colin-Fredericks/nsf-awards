This model replaces the usual finite linear  system with an integral equation in which the unknown is a Borel  measure. The research includes an analysis of the convergence  properties of this algorithm, numerical methods of implementation by  spline and wavelet bases, and an analysis of the smoothing effects of  these bases.  The convergence results provide mathematical reasons in  terms of the regularity properties of Borel measures, for the  seeming divergence of the numerical implementations of the finite  dimensional EM-ML algorithm. Also, since the EM-ML algorithm has been  recently extended to linear integral equations in which the kernel and  the unknown function are nonnegative, these results provide important  insight into the open problem of convergence of this algorithm. In  addition, the research introduces, analyzes, and develops novel  algorithms for dealing with data errors due to accidental coincidences  and attenuation. The proposers also investigate the mathematical  properties of the probability functions which link the emissions to  the detector geometry in both PET and single photon emission computed  tomography (SPECT). Preliminary work for SPECT links these functions  to the classical Poisson kernel. This study is important for  developing accurate, efficient, fast, alternatives to the EM-ML  reconstruction algorithm.  %%%  The mathematical realization of many problems in science, engineering,  and medicine, give rise to inverse problems which are ill-posed in the  sense of Hadamard, and in which positivity plays an important role.  This proposal deals mainly with the particular example of such a  problem occuring in the nuclear imaging procedure of PET. In this  procedure, a patient is given a radiopharmaceutical which is absorbed  disprop ortionately by various regions of the organ of interest and  emits positrons according to the amount absorbed. These emissions are  collected by PET scanners which surround the region of interest and  then used in reconstruction algorithms which generate images  containing important information about the metabolism of an organ or  region of interest. This information is extremely useful for blood  flow and metabolic activity studies. For instance, it is a valuable  tool in the diagnosis of tumors, in determining their rates of growth;  in psychological studies for mapping activation areas of the brain to  cognitive tasks, in determining the effects of various drugs on the  brain, and in quantitative measures of the health of the human heart.  The proposers develop a refined mathematical model for the PET process  and introduce novel mathematical and numerical methods for the  reconstruction of PET images. These reconstruction algorithms are  sufficiently flexible to deal with significant errors in the PET data,  caused by anatomical obstructions which prevent some of the emitted  photons from being registered in the appropriate detector. An  important component of this work is the development and evaluation of  efficient, reliable, accurate algorithms for reconstructing PET  images.  Although primarily directed to PET studies, the  results obtained in this reserach are also applicable to other medical  and engineering problems, such as those which occur in liver biopsies,  nondestructive evaluation of manufactured items, and the restoration  of blurred images from outer space.    ***",
