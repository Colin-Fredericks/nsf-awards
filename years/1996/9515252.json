The venue of the conference changes  annually.  Conference sites will be selected from a list of  several universities offering to host Cliometric Conferences.   The field of cliometrics evolved in the 1960s from research  interests in several fields; most notably economics, history, and  statistics, but drawing also on demography, political science,  and sociology.  Its focus has been on the application of economic  theory and quantitative analysis to a wide range of problems in  economic history.  The intent of the Cliometric Conference is  two-fold: to encourage new members of the profession and to  provide an opportunity for discussion and feedback on current  research in the field.  The record of previous Conferences  indicates that both goals have been met.  Of the 224 paper-  presenters at Cliometrics Conferences since 1985, 173, or 77  percent, presented but a single paper in that period.  At the  1995 conference, 75 percent of the presenters were first-time  presenters.  The practice of inviting a mix of new and  established scholars is considered extremely valuable by many  first-time attendees, who have discovered advisors, mentors and  research collaborators through these conferences.    At the same time, Cliometrics Conferences have served as a forum  for all major debates and developments in the field of economic  history and have consistently encouraged the development of new  and better data bases.  A large number of important works in the  field were first presented at Cliometrics Conferences.  In the  six conferences held so far in the 1990s, three major topical  areas are emerging, accounting for about a third of the papers  selected.  First is the timing and extent of market integration  for labor, commodities, and all factors to accompany the  continuing interest in capital market integration.  Second is   quantitative study of the political economy of public finance and  of public spending.  Third is analysis of political economy in a  broader sense: of legal systems, of property rights, and politics  itself.",
