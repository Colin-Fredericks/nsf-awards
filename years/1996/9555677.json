 "awd_abstract_narration": "9555677  Radford    Project Life focuses on the rural and poor in Arkansas, Louisiana,  and Texas, and is a professional development program for middle  grades and high school teachers of life sciences, focuses on  ecology, environmental science, and organismal biology.  The 4-year  program is designed to provide 124 hours per teacher of inservice  training in science content and reform methodologies to a total of  192 teachers in 3 locations.  Sixty of the teachers and 6 interns  will receive an additional 90 hours of additional leadership  training to prepare them to become workshop leaders and change  agents.  The project strives to develop: teachers sufficiently to  enhance their understanding of science concepts and inquiry  pedagogical skills.  Teachers have strong administrative support  for systemic change, and resources that allow local systems to  independently continue the systemic change begun by the project.   The Project will purchase kit materials with which to provide  professional development.  Equally important however, that teachers  will be sufficiently enhanced to transport science process skills  across various disciplines and concepts.    This proposal is a request to clone what the PI's claim is a  successful TE project.  Scientists and science educators (interns)  will be recruited, and paid a summer stipend, to become part of a  team - the members of which are classroom teachers.  The interns  will participate in summer workshops alongside classroom teachers.   Efforts will be made to have at least two teachers from each  participating school work as a team and collaborate on the sharing  of ideas and site based problem-solving.    The rationale for disseminating this project in the three targeted  states based on their rural similarity to the original Louisiana  site out of which outcomes were successful and funded by LaSIP.   The participating SSI's support this project.  They have not  however, offered cash.",
