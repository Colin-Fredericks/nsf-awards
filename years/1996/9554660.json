 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides a 2 week workshop focusing on parallel  processing for faculty from institutions with limited parallel  computing equipment.  It also includes a follow-through activities  during the following academic year.  The workshop covers material  on how to design and write parallel programs, parallel computer  architectures, techniques for integrating parallel computing into  computer science courses,and methods and materials for teaching  parallel processing to UG students.  The workshop includes a  significant laboratory portion in which participants will have the  opportunity to write, analyze, and compare parallel programs for  various parallel computers and simulators. many of the lab  activities will be assignments that have been successfully used  with students.  a portion of the workshop will be devoted to the  design of a parallel processing unit or course to be implemented  during the academic year following the workshop.  As part of the  workshop, 4 participants from prior parallel processing workshops  at Illinois State University, will present the work that they have  done with UG students in parallel processing.  Follow-through  activities will include an interactive forum during following  forum, in which past participants will talk about their work.   Dissemination will occur at annual national CS forums.",
