 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630867  Bishop    The cerebellum is a part of the brain that controls and  coordinates  movement.  Along with the cerebellum, there are several  brainstem centers  which receive information regarding the status of a  movement.   The  information is initially processed in these centers and then  relayed to the  cerebellum where it is used in circuitry that ultimately  fine tunes motor  control.  One of these brainstem centers that provides  information to the  cerebellum is a nuclear group called the inferior olivary  complex.  Any  changes in the message sent out by the olivary complex will  have a direct  impact on cerebellar circuits which control movement.  The  intent of this  study is to use anatomical and physiological techniques to  better understand  how two distinct classes of neuroactive chemicals, namely  neuropeptides and  monoamines, modulate the activity of neurons in the inferior  olive.  The  anatomical studies will define the distribution of the  peptide calcitonin  gene related peptide, and the monoamine serotonin, both of  which are known to  be present and active in cerebellar circuits.  In addition,  we will use  techniques to determine the brainstem source of these two  neuroactive  chemicals. The physiological studies are designed to  determine how this  neuropeptide and monoamine change the responsiveness of  neurons in the  olivary complex.  In addition, we will analyze how these two  distinct classes  of neuroactive chemicals interact with each other  to modify  the way in which  olivary neurons respond to inputs derived from other regions  of the brain and  spinal cord.  An understanding of how olivary output is  modulated by  chemically defined inputs is critical for our understanding  of how the  olivocerebellar system functions in coordinating motor  activity.",
