 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research projects deals with control of the start-up and  shut-down of boilers in uncertain time-varying systems such as  power plants using robust predictive control techniques and  localized time-frequency concepts. Specifically, it develops  strategies for synthesis of suboptimal robust controllers of  reduced computational complexity. Such control algorithms serves  as enabling technologies for the next generation  operating  regimes for power plants as well as a guide for the future  control-driven power plant designing and other complex mechanical  systems. The approach utilizes an extension of H-infinity  productive control methodology, and a method of evaluation and  representation of unmodeled plant dynamics to time varying case.  On this basis it develops a new time-frequency localized  framework for robust predictive control of time-varying plants  which utilizes the wavelet-based complexity reduction o the  computation of control laws, and reduction in controller  conservativeness due to the time-frequency localized  representation of model uncertainty.",
