 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to conduct a multi-phased  evaluation of an experimental,multi-disciplinary coordinated  program (WISER) that pairs first-year female students with faculty  in research environments.  First-year students are mentored and  given duties and instruction in an on-going research project over  two semesters.  The program is united through its common objectives  and a common recruitment process that leads to freely chosen,  interdisciplinary parings.  Faculty and staff at Penn State will  construct an evaluation instrument which will allow them to refine  the program to better retain or support three groups of  participants:  WISER interns themselves, graduate students who  supervise them, and faculty who have accepted first year students  into their research labs and who provide essential training,  mentoring and role modeling.    The project will demonstrate how this program can be disseminated  to two-year institutions that are crucial in the SEM pipeline for  women.  A two-year urban campus on Penn State at Abington-Ogontz  will begin a WISER program to test the model.  They will use the  faculty-student matching which is a key attribute of this program.   Participating at both institutions are faculty and graduate  students from the colleges of earth and mineral sciences,  engineering, agricultural sciences and health science, a majority  of whom are female.  Based on the results of the evaluation, the  proposers will present the WISER program (modified by the result of  the evaluation) to 400 affiliated colleges and universities that  form the 52 NASA Space Grant Consortia in every state, the District  of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.  The final goal is to impact  communities by sponsoring WISERs to present descriptions of their  experiences with research in the sciences and engineering to the K-  12 students at their former middle or high schools.",
