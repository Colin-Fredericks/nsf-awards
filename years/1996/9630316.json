 "awd_abstract_narration": "The forest canopy is increasingly regarded as a region of  great ecological importance. Canopy communities are poorly  understood, partly due to access problems and partly due to  a lack of expertise and software tools to analyze complex  three-dimensional tree crown data.  The PIs propose an  interdisciplinary effort to develop database systems to  manage, analyze, and disseminate shared data pertaining to  complex ecological questions using forest canopy data.    The demonstration project will be carried about among seven  cooperating but independent researchers at a forest canopy  research site, the Wind River Canopy Research Facility in  Washington State. Data from existing projects that focus at  different spatial and temporal scales will be linked to  allow efficient use of site data and to solve novel  questions that could not be addressed by a single  researcher's data sets. The resulting database management  tools will allow researchers to easily gain access to site-  specific data and each others' data, which will enhance the  productivity both of the individual scientists and of the  site as a whole.    The initial research focus will be on the development of  data models and prototype data structures and data sets for  one concurrent study of forest canopy structure and  hydrology. That research examines the role of forest  canopies in intercepting, modifying, retaining, and  conducting water from atmospheric sources (rain, mist, snow)  to the forest floor. Forest canopy structure has obvious  implications in these processes, but the complexity and  three-dimensional nature of forest canopies (especially  those of old-growth, structurally complex forests) has  prevented ecologists from gaining a quantified understanding  of the patterns and processes underlying these interactions.    The PI will also continue refining the two database browsers  for the Wind River Site data and will extend the data model  for those browsers to show the connection with the canopy  structure and hydro logy model. Development of a sound data  model will allow forest canopy scientists to organize,  visualize, and analyze their data in powerful ways. It will  also provide the means to link forest canopy structural data  with relevant environmental data sets (such as  meteorological data) and with other forest functional data  sets (e.g., photosynthesis of canopy organisms).",
