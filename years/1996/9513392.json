 "awd_abstract_narration": "In  recent  years, microsensors (5-30 microns in  diameter)  have  been  developed to investigate rapid (11000 Hz) chemical  signaling  in  biological  systems. Recent electrochemical recording methods  such  as  highspeed chronoamperometry (1-25Hz), fast-scan cyclic voltammetry  (10  Hz  and 100-1000 v/sec scan rates) and amperometry (1000 Hz resolution)  have  been  developed for such recordings. The study of rapid  chemical  signaling  requires  the use of microelectrodes  that  are  coupled  to  sensitive  instrumentation that is capable of recording and  converting  the  small changes in current that are due to chemical reactions at the  surfaces of the microsensors. A few laboratory designed instruments and  some  commercial  instruments  are available.  However,  no  low  noise  \"turnkey\"  system  that is capable of recording, displaying,  analyzing  data  and  outputting results is available to the scientific community.  In   addition,  some  commercial  instrumentation  often   requires   a  combination  of  other  laboratory instruments as  seen  in  Figure  la  (adapted from Stamford et al.  1992).  Presently,  there  is  no  self  contained  microcomputer-based  instrument  that  is  available  to  scientists  that  encompasses  the  capabilities  to  record rapid electrochemical signals using  fast-scan  cyclic    voltammetry,    highspeed   chronoamperometry,    1000-6000Hz  amperometry,   more   standard   electrochemical   methods,   and   new  modifications of the rapid electrochemical recording methods.          A  major  goal  of  this proposal is to carry  out  the  Phase  I  (design) and Phase II (modification and refinement) development  of  an  automated multi-channel recording system as depicted in Figure lb. Such  an   instrument,  which  we  call  FAST  for  Fast  Analytical  Sensing  Technology,  will  be  useful  to students,  postdoctoral  fellows  and  principal  investigators  in  the fields of  cell  biology,  chemistry,  biology, neuroscience, pharmacolog y, physiology, chemoreception, marine  biollogy, psychology and other biological sciences. The second goal  of  this  proposal  is to further develop microsensors for  the  selective,  rapid,  and  sensitive measures of dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin,  nitric  oxide  and glutamate in biological systems. Both  carbon  fiber  based  probes and semiconductor based probe designs will be  developed.  Further   sensor  development  is  needed  to  enhance  the   recording  capabilities  of currently available instrumentation and  the  proposed  FASTin vivo electrochemical recording system.                            ~",
