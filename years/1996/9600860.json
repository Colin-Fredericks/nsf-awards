Eubacteria,  like  Escherichia   coli   and  Salmonella  typhimurium, respond to  chemical  gradients  by  modulating their swimming patterns towards a more  favorable  chemical   environment.   In   eubacteria   a   family    of  transmembrane    receptors   called   transducers    mediate  chemotaxis and some aspects of their mechanism of action  is  known.  It  is  presumed that the Archaea are  more  closely  related  to  eukaryotes  than to  eubacteria.  Halobacterium  salinarium,  an Archaeon, responds to chemical, oxygen,  and  light  gradients.  A family of putative transducer  proteins  has  been  identified in H. salinarium using a site-specific  multiple  antigenic  peptide antibody raised  against  a  23  amino  acids  peptide.  This  peptide  represents  a  highly  conserved region in eubacterial transducers. A complementary  oligonucleotide probe was designed based on  this  conserved  region  and  was  used to select thirteen  putative  methyl-  accepting  taxis  genes. Based the structural  and  putative  functional   homology  with  eubacterial  transducers,   the  putative  transducers fall into three structurally  distinct  subfamilies:  a)  a  type  with two  transmembrane  segments  connecting large extra- and intracellular domains; b) a type  with   two   or   more   transmembrane  segments   with   an  intracellular domain only; and c) a type that exists only in  the  cytosol  as  a  soluble transducer.  A  combination  of  physiological, genetic, and biochemical approaches  will  be  used  to  study  the signal transduction  mechanism  of  the  unique transducer proteins in the Archaea H. salinarium.  %%%  A basic property of living cells is their ability to respond  to   specific,   external  chemical  signals   and   respond  appropriately.
