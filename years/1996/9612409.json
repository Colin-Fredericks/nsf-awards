With mentoring as the cornerstone of its students development  programs, NACME has:    I.   Produced more than 6,000 underrepresented minority students       who have completed engineering degrees through NACME       scholarship programs, which include a strong mentoring       component, academic support, professional development,       undergraduate research or internships, and need-based       financial aid;      II.  Demonstrated student success in various special programs --       84% retention rate (out of 120 students) compared to the       national average of 35% for minorities; an average GPA of 3.4       for these students, with almost half of the graduates pursuing       advanced degrees full-time;      III. Provides rigorous training for mentors, i.e. an engineer, a       professor, or NACME staff;      IV.  Provides an effective structure in its projects for       precollege, bridge and undergraduate support and solicits       involvement from professionals, faculty, and professional       societies;      V.   Disseminated program characteristics through publications and       through projects designed for special groups; and      VI.  Developed a program that is replicable and likely to continue       to influence the success of underrepresented groups for       sometime to come.",
