 "awd_abstract_narration": "Salm  9514574      The ability of the cells of the brain to reorganize in response to  physiological stimuli is known as plasticity.  Plasticity has been  shown to occur in neurons and the support cells of the brain, also  known as glial cells.  In response to changes in the local  environment, glial cells change shape and their connections to  respond to the demands placed upon them.  However, the mechanisms  involved in eliciting the changes of the glial cells is currently  unknown.  Dr. Salm is investigating the mechanisms by which glial  plasticity occurs in a specific region of the brain.  In this  region, dehydration is a powerful physiological stimulus and it  produces marked rearrangements in the cellular structure and  function within the region.   Whether this stimulus causes glial  death, or growth is to be explored, as are other structural changes  in the region.  This study will provide a more complete  understanding of the relationship between the environment and the  function of the brain.  This basic relationship ultimately forms  the basis for an animal's behavioral response to its environment,  including the human animal.",
