 "awd_abstract_narration": "The process of encouraging undergraduates to select or continue  career choices in the mathematical sciences must begin as early  as possible.  In our experience, undergraduates usually choose to  major in mathematics early, often at matriculation, and, from  that point on, the process is all-too-often one of attrition.   Our Fast-Track Program in Mathematics and Statistics is designed  to identify potentially outstanding mathematics students as (and  before) they enter university, and immerse them in a stimulating  research-oriented environment over a five-year period which will  keep their interest in mathematics fresh as their competence  grows.  The principal ingredients in the program are intensive  mentoring by faculty who are involved in mathematical research,  an independent research/study project each academic term for each  student, a challenging mathematics curriculum, seminars in  mathematics and the ethics of mathematical research which will  emphasize student participant and interaction among students, and  small-group work projects.  In the process, students will  complete the requirements for both a Bachelor's and a Master's  degree in mathematics, meting all the liberal arts course  distribution requirements (core curriculum) of UAB, and will be  well-prepared for graduate work involving research in  mathematics.  The UAB Mathematics Department and NSF share in the  support of student participants while they are undergraduates (at  most four years).  Thereafter, support of the student is the  responsibility of the UAB Mathematics Department.",
