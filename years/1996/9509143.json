 "awd_abstract_narration": "A large number of applications from information processing as  well as science and engineering require processing large amounts  of data.  Particularly, in the science and engineering domain,  the so called ``grand challenge applications'' fall in this  category.  Thus, it has become apparent that I/O performance much  more than CPU or communication performance may be the limiting  factor in future parallel computing systems. Many software and  hardware components play a key role in I/O operations and any one  of them can cause severe bottlenecks.  The disparity between the  performance of disk systems and CPU (and interconnect)  performance requires the use of large-scale parallelism (and  supporting software) to address the scalability and performance  problems in I/O subsystems. But parallelism in the I/O systems  introduces complexities for the system software including  compilers, runtime systems and file systems.    This research addresses many system software problems in the  parallel I/O domain.  To ameliorate the I/O bottlenecks, the  following are necessary:  1) techniques for sophisticated runtime  systems that incorporate the notion of collective I/O, data reuse  and prefetching; 2) compiler analysis to identify various  optimizations including data access reorganization, opportunities  for overlapping computations and I/O, and data staging to handle  limited memory for out-of-core computations; and 3) file systems  optimizations to recognize collective access patterns for  coordinating accesses of processes that are part of parallel  programs, and using these access patterns for prefetching, buffer  allocation and replacement strategies.  Traditional interfaces  for file systems lack the necessary semantics to permit the above  optimizations. Thus, it is necessary to develop interfaces  between the compiler and the runtime systems, and the runtime  system and the file systems, that facilitate the flow of semantic  information about access patterns to enable optimizations.  This  res earch pursues the design and development of techniques for  compiler analysis, mechanisms and algorithms for runtime systems,  and interfaces and optimizations for file systems to enable  high-  performance I/O in parallel computers. These techniques are being  evaluated by implementing them on parallel systems.  ***",
