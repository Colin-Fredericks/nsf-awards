 "awd_abstract_narration": "9526340  Stepp  Recent evaluations of the key needs for earthquake engineering  and earthquake hazard mitigation have recommended the  establishment of a committee to overview and give advice  concerning earthquake strong motion activities in the United  States (Higgins, 1993). This action is to support the formation  and management of this committee, which will provide a focal  point for over-viewing the strong motion activities in the United  States and in other countries.    This committee is to consist of representatives from the various  individual strong motion recording networks and data users from  the academic and practicing communities in the U.S., with the  committee meeting on a regular basis. It will identify issues  affecting strong motion data acquisition and dissemination, set  priorities to address the issues, and form working groups to  develop working papers with specific recommended actions to be  taken. Issues to be addressed include strong motion data needs,  data processing, common data formatting, mechanisms for data  dissemination, instrumentation needs, acquisition and  dissemination of foreign strong motion data, and other issues to  be identified by the committee. Issue papers developed by working  groups of the committee will be reviewed in focused workshops.  Workshop participants will be selected from the committee and  additional data users. The proceedings of the workshops will  serve as guidelines for effective, coordinated strong motion data  acquisition, dissemination and usage.  ***",
