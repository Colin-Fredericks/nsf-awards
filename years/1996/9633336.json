 "awd_abstract_narration": "An adaptive computing system is one that evolves its behavior  based on changes in the environment. For an adaptable system  built on a distributed architecture where multiple machines are  connected by a nework, such changes can range from site failures  to updated application requirements. The evolutionary action  taken when a change occurs can vary as well, ranging from  dynamically reconfiguring the system software to maintain the  same service guarantees under changed conditions, to negotiating  new service guarantees with the application.    The goal of this project is to develop fundamental new techniques  for designing and implementing adaptive distributed computing  systems.  The specific focus is on providing a distribution  support layer, a software layer implementing strong execution  guarantees regarding the distributed state of the application,  that can adapt to changes. The research concentrates on two lines  of investigation: (1) the development of a conceptual model for  systems of this type and (2) a new approach to implementing  adaptive distributed systems based on fine-grain code modules  called micro-protocols. The framework is being extended to  support dynamic evolution of software, including reconfiguration,  dynamic code linking, and runtime code generation.  ***",
