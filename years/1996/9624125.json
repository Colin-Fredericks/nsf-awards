 "awd_abstract_narration": "Future high speed networks will carry traffic from a variety of   applications, including distributed computing/database applications.   The primary motivation to use high speed networks for this application   class  is to achieve very low latencies, and more  importantly, to   obtain guarantees on the delay bounds at the application level.  This   project will investigate application level performance in high speed   networks for this application class.  The objectives of this research   are to (1) characterize traffic from this application class using   actual traces, (2) determine application-level QoS requirements for   this application class, (3) translate the end-to-end application-level   QoS requirements to network level per node QoS (for instance,   cell-level QoS for switching nodes in ATM networks), and (4) assess the   effectiveness of existing techniques (both at the network as well as   the  application level) to guarantee QoS requirements for this   application class.  Analytical and simulation techniques assisted by   measurements will be used in this research.  The significance of this   research will be its contributions to the fundamental understanding  of   the interaction between distributed computing/database applications and   high speed networking architectures and protocols.",
