 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is on the numerical study of strongly  gravitating systems with special emphasis on the properties  of the gravitational waves they generated in dynamical  evolutions.  This uses supercomputers for fully numerical  treatments, and semi-analytical methods closely coupled to  the numerical treatments, to study highly non-linear and  dynamical astrophysical events, like the inspiral  coalescence of compact binary systems consisting of neutron  stars and/or black holes.  One of the focuses of the research is on the accurate  numerical constructions and analyses of 3D black hole  spacetimes.  Instead of the traditional approach of using  time slicings to avoid the singularities inherent in black  hole spacetimes, Prof. Suen's group will develop an approach  in full 3+1 numerical relativity which uses the apparent  horizons as inner boundaries in dynamical evolutions.  This  apparent horizon boundary condition approach is expected to  have major impact on the numerical study of black hole  spacetimes.  Apparent horizons and event horizons are  important characteristic of black holes.  The PI is  developing routines to determine their existence and  locations, as well as tools for analyzing their properties,  in a numerically constructed 3+1 dimensional spacetime.  These routines, to be available to the numerical relativity  community soon, will have impact on the study of black  holes.",
