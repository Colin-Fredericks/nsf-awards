 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Biology Department is committed to incorporating scientific inquiry throughout the curriculum. This project targets the Developmental Biology course and makes possible a set of inquiry-based projects that use various light and scanning electron microscopic techniques to investigate Drosophila embryogenesis. These projects parallel and extend examples of cleavage and gastrulation presented in lecture. They also solidify understanding of subsequent axis and pattern formation.   Specifically, students observe cleavage and gastrulation events using bright field, differential-interference-contrast (DIC) and phase contrast techniques. Early developmental events are also documented using videomicroscopy. In the inquiry-based component of the lab, students work in groups to either investigate changes in nuclear and cytoskeletal organization using fluorescent markers or changes in surface morphology using the scanning electron microscope (SEM). The projects emphasize embryogenesis as a set of questions to be explored. These inquiry-based projects also build virtues associated with research: technical skill, enthusiasm, confidence, perseverance, attention to detail, and creative problem solving. Pilot studies using the SEM and fluorescent markers for nuclei and actin filaments were successful in the previous offerings of Developmental Biology.   The new equipment used in this project may expand the current microscopic capabilities to include DIC and video documentation and enhance significantly students' capabilities in phase-contrast, fluorescence, and SEM studies. This equipment is necessary for solidifying and expanding the investigative projects described. Since few inquiry-based exercises are described in contemporary laboratory manuals for use in Developmental Biology, this set of projects makes a significant contribution to undergraduate Developmental Biology laboratories. The equipment is also being incorporated into the existing secondary school outreach programs.",
