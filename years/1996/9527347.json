 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    9527347          Kanatzidis    This research is concerned with the use of molten  polychalcogenide salts as reactive media to explore the synthesis  of new chalcogenide materials at low and intermediate  temperatures (200-500  C). Various A2QX salts (A=alkali cation,  Q=S, Se, Te) will be used in reactions with late transition  metals and main-group elements. Emphasis will be given in the  stabilization of quaternary phases. Three kinds of quaternary  compounds will be explored in this stage. One kind involves the  mixed-metal system A/M/M'/Q (M=late transition metal,  M'=lanthanide, actinide). The second involves the mixed-chalcogen  system A/M/S/Te. The synthetic approach will use binary alloy  compounds as starting materials and mixed fluxes such as mixed  A2TexSy. The third kind involves the use of the thio- and  seleno-phosphate fluxes in materials synthesis. These fluxes are  new and are designed to yield novel thiophosphate and  selenophosphate solids containing the  PxQy n- polyanions (where  Q=S, Se). The physical properties of the new compounds, such as  spectroscopic, thermal and magnetic will be studied as a function  of temperature. In order to probe for unusual electronic  phenomena, the charge transport properties of the new compounds  will be studied in detail via variable temperature four-probe  resistivity and thermoelectric power (Seebeck) measurements on  single crystals.   %%%  This research is concerned with new methodologies to discover new  solid state materials having various technologically important  properties. Promising materials will be studied further and their  potential for applications will be evaluated. The subject of this  proposal is performing reactions using molten salts as solvents.  Molten salts have been employed for well over 100 years for high-  temperature single crystal growth.  Although many salts are high  melting species, eutectic combinations of binary salts and salts  of polyatomic species often have melting points well below the  te mperatures of classical solid-state synthesis, making possible  their use in the exploration of new chemistry at intermediate  temperatures. In some cases, such salts act not only as solvents,  but also as reactants, providing species which can be  incorporated into the final product. Such studies are important  because polysulfide ligands have been implicated in the  hydrodesulfurization of crude oil, where they are thought to be  present at the surface of metal sulfide catalysts.  Polychalcogenide glasses also are important as materials for  non-linear optics, IR wave guides, optical switching, and optical  information storage, but the structure/property relationships  have not been well determined due to the amorphous nature of the  compounds.",
