 "awd_abstract_narration": "The biological exploration of the earth has resulted in  enormous museum collections. Museum specimens and their  associated data document biodiversity and provide vital  infrastructure supporting the missions of systematics.  Access to collections data is crucial for the rapid progress  of systematics and ultimately for the assessment, analysis,  and management of biotic resources. U.S. collections are  held by more than 150 museums and botanical gardens, and the  highly partitioned distribution of collections data among  autonomously managed databases impedes their effective use.  The unmet need is for technology that enables users to  assemble data from distributed sources, while hiding the  complexity of data distribution, and the heterogeneity among  local systems and schemas.    The federated databases model architecture has repeatedly  been identified as appropriate for developing information  interoperability within the biological sciences.  Establishing a federation of collections databases imposes a  minimal set of requirements for cooperation within a  community. While technical solutions for enabling database  interoperability will be developed in the computer science  community, the required semantic data standards can only  result from efforts arising within and carried out by the  collections community.    This project is being conducted under the auspices of the  Association of Systematics Collections (ASC) Committee on  Computerization and Networking, and represents a  continuation of an effort on behalf of the systematics  community (museums and similar institutions) to develop an  information model for biological collections. The model will  encompass all disciplines, not just plants or single animal  groups, and all taxa, not just endangered or threatened  species. The goal is to develop a unifying, consensus-based,  implementation-independent (conceptual) schema for  collections information, down to the level of the atomic  data concept. This project does not propose to  build a  collections database management system, but rather, to  establish a semantic data standard that will enable specimen  data to be combined across systematics disciplines to  address pressing resource management needs and to test  complex research questions.",
