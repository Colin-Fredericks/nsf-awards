 "awd_abstract_narration": "Murphey  9514701     Nerve cells, or neurons, communicate with each other at specialized junctions   called synapses.  At chemical synapses, an active neuron releases a particular   chemical neurotransmitter compound from the presynaptic side of the terminal to   cross the tiny synaptic gap and bind to receptor molecules on the postsynaptic   cell.  Binding of the neurotransmitter leads to an electrophysiological change   called the postsynaptic potential. Two sensitive indicators of transmitter release   that can be measured by electrophysiological recordings are facilitation, which is   an increased postsynaptic response, and depression, which is a decreased   postsynaptic response.  Some identified single cells in insects can make two   different kinds of synapse on postsynaptic cells, facilitating at one cell and   depressing at the other.  The emergence of facilitation at a synapse has been   found to be regulated by the postsynaptic cell, so the target cell has an effect on   the input it receives.  This work will use electrophysiology and pharmacology to   examine this retrograde regulation of transmitter release, using the advantages   of invertebrate nervous systems in having particular identifiable synapses.  It   may be that a continuous release of a co-transmitter differentially adjusts the   properties of the presynaptic terminal, or instead that the postsynaptic neurons   release a substance that regulates the function of the presynaptic terminal.     Results from this work will be important to understanding the important issue of   how synaptic activity is regulated, and these results are likely to have a broad   impact in both neurophysiology and developmental neuroscience.",
