 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for research on a new class of jointless mechanical mechanisms.  These mechanisms, which obtain motion and force amplification through flexure, are called compliant mechanisms.  The research will seek to develop mathematical models of compliant mechanisms suitable for design synthesis, validation and demonstration of the mathematical models through construction of prototype devices, development of a set of compliant mechanism design building blocks and materials, and investigation of compliant mechanisms occurring in nature.  A goal of this research is the development of a methodology for the design of compliant mechanisms.   If successful, this research could impact the design of many mechanical and electromechanical devices.  Compliant mechanisms have the potential to drastically reduce mechanism parts counts and in some cases, replace even complex mechanisms with a single part.  Particularly in the latter case, reductions in assembly cost can be substantial.  Compliant mechanisms have the further advantages of requiring no bearing surfaces and no lubrication.  Thus despite their high degree of functionality, compliant parts may often be less costly to produce.",
