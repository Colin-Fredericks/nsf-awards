 "awd_abstract_narration": "9513527  Duerksen-Hughes  The long term goal of  this research is to define on a molecular level the regulation of p53, a protein which plays a major role in DNA repair, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. The first goal is to examine how the degradation of p53 is regulated. Previous work has shown that the rapid turnover of p53 during normal metabolism can be at least partially attributed to the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system. Following DNA damage, the p53 protein is stabilized; the mechanism for this stabilization is unknown. This work focuses on two conditions which can stabilize p53; damage to the cellular DNA, and the expression of adenovirus ElA. Two possible mechanisms for p53 stabilization will be tested: that the increased stability is a result of changes in the activity of components of the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system, and that the change in stability is a result of modifications made to p53 itself. Cells with conditional mutations in the ubiquitin-dependent system will be utilized to examine the role of that system in p53 turnover. Protein turnover and steady-state levels will be measured by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis, respectively. The second goal of this work is to develop and characterize mutations in one or more of the enzymes likely to participate in the turnover of p53, and to test cells expressing these mutations for their ability to degrade that protein. One target enzyme is E6-AP, which functions to transfer activated ubiquitin to p53 and thus render it a substrate for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Also, a strategy for creating random mutations in selected cell lines, then screening the resulting mutants in a way which is expected to yield temperature-sensitive mutations in one or more of the enzymes which participate in p53 degradation has been developed. The results of this work will lead to an understanding of whether the ubiquitin-mediated system is important in p53 breakdown and how the actual activities of the various enzymes ma y shift under different conditions. This should set the stage for further studies in how p53 levels are regulated on a molecular level. In addition, cell lines conditionally mutant in their ability to degrade p53 will be useful in several ways. Not only will they will provide a valuable tool in studying the function of p53 under various conditions, but because these mutations are expected to be in enzymes associated with the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system, they will provide specific tools for studies of the functions and substrates of that system in general.  %%%  Individuals are constantly exposed to a wide variety of natural and man-made substances which can damage DNA in the genome, and are therefore called \"genotoxins.\" To protect themselves, all organisms possess several mechanisms to prevent or repair DNA damage.   One of the most important of these mechanisms uses a protein called \"p53.\" When a cell's DNA is damaged, the levels of p53 rise. This causes one of two things to happen: the cell may stop dividing until the damage is repaired; or, if the damage is too great to repair, the cell may commit \"cellular suicide.\" In either case, damaged DNA is not copied, and this helps to prevent mutations. It is already known that the reason p53 levels rise when DNA is damaged is not because more protein  is made, but because the p53 is degraded more slowly than usual. What is not known is how the degradation rate is altered. The first goal of this proposal, then, is to look at two situations where p53 is stabilized (following DNA damage and when a virus protein called ElA is present) to see if the protein lasts longer because the enzymes that degrade it are less active, or because the p53 itself has been changed in some way. The second goal also concerns degradation of p53. One of the enzymes which can help to break down p53 is called E6-AP. A cell line where E6-AP has been mutated will be created and characterized. Observing how these cells control p53 will then help researchers understand  more about how and when p53 is degraded.",
