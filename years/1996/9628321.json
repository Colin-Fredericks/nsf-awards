The key to the efficiency is an  understanding of the energy loss processes in the lasing media.  Many useful  lasers operate in quasi-four level mode where they experience large losses and  low efficiencies.  When the laser media is a crystal, the crystal field interacts  with the energy manifolds of the dopant.  The crystal field interaction can  adjust the energy manifolds of the dopant in the crystal by as much as 500 cm-1  and cause large splittings relative to the free ion.  The position and splittings  of these manifolds are critical for efficient laser performance.       The proposed research will investigate the effect of the crystal field on the  critical factors affecting the performance of quasi-four level solid state cross  sections which are key metrics in rare earth ion laser performance and the  effects on processes such as energy transfer, upconversion, and non-radiative  relaxation will provide full understanding of effect of the crystal field on  laser performance.  The degree crystal field splitting in the lower laser level  and the upper level manifold dictates the thermal population on each level and  ultimately laser performance.  The larger crystal field splitting, the smaller  the lower laser level population and higher upper laser level population.  The  decreased lower laser level and increased upper laser level populations and  larger absorption and emission cross sections will significantly improve laser  thresholds and slope efficiencies.  A favorable effect of these splittings on key  processes such as energy transfer, upconversion, inter-manifold, and intra-  manifold relaxation contributes to improved laser performance.       For the proposed three years, the specific objectives of the investigation   are to determine the effect of crystal field on the threshold and slope  efficiency of quasi-four level systems and  understanding the field effects on   the parameters and processes influencing laser performance.  The effect of the  crystal field on parameters such as absorption and emission cross sections, and  processes such as energy transfer, upconversion and non-radiative relaxation will  be studied.  The fluorapatite family, specifically Ca5(PO4)3F, Sr5(PO4)3F, and  Ba5(PO4)3F have been chosen since they are excellent candidates for efficient  quasi-four level lasers due to their large crystal field splittings and crystal  field parameters are varied by substitution of the alkaline earth metal.  This  trend on the crystal field parameters from Ca to Ba will be utilized to study its  affect on the parameters and processes influencing the laser performance above  mentioned.  Tm3+ will be utilized as the probe since it exhibits a wealth of  processes which affects the laser performance in many quasi-four level systems.   Tm3+ itself is also an important quasi-four level laser ion.  In the proposed  investigation, a full understanding of the effect of crystal field parameters on  quasi-four laser performance will be achieved while evaluating a potentially  useful laser system such as Tm3+ doped fluoroapatites.     The investigative team combines the expertise of crystal growth of high  quality di-electric crystals, spectroscopy in solid state materials, ultrafast  kinetics, and rare earth ion laser development.  This team will grow, fabricate,  and fully evaluate the materials in laboratories housed on campus.  Temperature  dependent absorption and emission will be used to determine the crystal field  splitting, absorption and emission cross sections and energy branching ratios.   Time resolved emission and absorption will be used to examine the radiative, non-  radiative, and upconversion rates in the materials.  A laser test bed will be  constructed to evaluate the laser performance of the materials.",
