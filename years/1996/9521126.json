The  scientific  goal of this research project is  to  gain  a  deeper  understanding of the physical laws which govern the magnetic  behavior  as the film thickness approached the limit of few monolayers. Evidence  for  different distinct classes of magnetic behavior, and a  crossover  in  dimensionality (from three- to two-dimensions), is observed as the  film   thickness  approaches  a  few  monolayers.  In  this  ultrathin  thickness  regime,  the  films are metastable due  to  the  `clamping'  influence  of  the  substrate crystal's lattice.  It  is  possible  to  fabricate new phases of matter, with unique properties, which  do  not  exist in bulk material. New alloys with novel magnetic properties hold  high   promise   for  scientific  research  and  future  technological  application.  This  project deals with the fundamental  properties  of  these  ultrathin films as investigated by the magnetooptic Kerr effect  and related techniques.  %%%  This  project  deals  with magnetism studies  of  ultrathin  films  of  magnetic  atoms.  The films are deposited atomic-layer-by-atomic-layer  on  atomically  flat  substrates. The  arrangement  of  the  deposited  surface atoms is determined primarily by the underlying substrate.  As  a  result the surface atoms have different properties from what  would  be  found  for  the same atoms in a normal bulk phase.  These  surface  metastable  magnetic  layers  often exhibit  unusual  and  unsuspected  behavior, and have great potential for advanced materials for magnetic  recording  and sensor devices. This research probes the  magnetism  of  ultrathin  magnetic  layers to understand the fundamental  physics  of  these  materials. The results are of basic interest and could lead  to  new materials for practical applica tions.  ***",
