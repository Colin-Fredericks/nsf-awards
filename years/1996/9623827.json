Using x-ray scattering instrumentation located  at  the  University  of  Missouri  and at the National  Synchrotron  Light  Source  (NSLS)  at Brookhaven National Laboratory,  the  research  quantitatively  investigates height  f1uctuations  of  a  growing  crystal  surface  which  arise  intrinsically  from  the   growth  process,   as   well  as  induced  extrinsically  from   extended  crystalline  defects. The scientific program  includes:  (1)  New  experiments  which utilize the unique combination of surface  and  bulk  sensitivity  of  x-rays to address  the  origin  of  misfit  dislocation  induced  surface roughness, (2)  Extensive  in  situ  experiments on metals to test theories of kinetic roughening, and  (3)  Novel  experiments to investigate transient growth dynamics.  The  information from these experiments will provide  insight  on  how atoms move and assemble on the surface, thereby leading to  a  better  understanding  of  the growth dynamics.  The  project  is  fundamental  in  nature, but the results will be  relevant  to  a  range technologically important disciplines.  %%%  The  object  of  this  research is the investigation,  at  atomic  scale, of fundamental physical processes that are involved in the  growth  of  thin films. This is important because thin films  are  used   in   a  myriad  of  technological  applications;   e.   g.  semiconductor devices, adhesives, catalysts and surface coatings.  All  of  these  applications rely on the ability to  control  the  surface  morphology  of the films. The project  will  use  unique  x-ray scattering facilities at the University of Missouri and  at  the  Brookhaven  National Laboratory National  Synchrotron  Light  Source  (NSLS). I n particular, the extremely intense  synchrotron  x-ray  radiation at the NSLS will allow the study of the temporal  evolution  of  a rough surface film. The information  from  these  experiments  will provide insight on how atoms move and  assemble  on  the surface, thereby leading to a better understanding of the  growth  dynamics. The project is fundamental in nature,  but  the  results  will  be  relevant to a range technologically  important  disciplines.  ***",
