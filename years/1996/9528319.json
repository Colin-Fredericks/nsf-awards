 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the dissertation research of an  anthropology student from the University of Michigan.  The study  tries to explain variations in fertility levels in a developing  country--Brazil-- through the impact of variations in television  exposure.  Previous studies have suggested that the medium has a  `contraceptive effect`, separate from other changes linked to  industrialization and urbanization, through the exposure of  viewers to new ideas, values, and behaviors.  The study will  examine the hypothesis that the degree of television exposure  affects lifetime fertility and will also focus on the link  between TV viewing and attitudes about contraception, the  perceived value of children, and notions of ideal family size.  The methods include qualitative ethnographic information through  participant-observation and intensive interviews, and  quantitative data from a survey of 250-300 women in Arembepe,  Bahia, as well as 50-80 women in a more rural community with less  television availability.  The data will be linked to a study on  this subject in the region a decade ago.  This project is important because it will shed light on the role  that television may play in lowering fertility levels in  developing countries, and will elucidate the link between  demographic shifts and the exposure to new ideas and information.  Advances in our knowledge about the causes of family size are  important for planners concerned about world population growth.",
