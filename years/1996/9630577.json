 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS-9630577    Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are some of the most widespread of  environmental pollutants.  Understanding PAH sorption processes in aqueous environmental is important because sorption reactions can greatly affect their mobility, chemical reactivity, bioavailability and toxicity, as well as our ability to remediate PAH-contaminated sites.  The proposed project is a multidisciplinary effort that will use fluorescence and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopies to probe PAH-mineral surface sorption reactions at a molecular level.    Steady-state and time-resolved measurements of adsorbed PAH fluorescence intensity, fine structure, anisotropy and excimer/exciplex formation in addition to NMR rotational line-broadening will provide information on the strength of interaction and distances of approach between PAH molecules and mineral surfaces.  The specific objectives are to:  (1) develop fluorescence and NMR techniques for studying the various PAH-inorganic surface reaction particular to aqueous environmental systems, (2) compare and contrast the information obtained from the two types of spectroscopy for simple model systems of various organic solvents and aqueous solutions of  varying viscosity, (3) monitor adsorbed PAH spectroscopic PAH spectroscopic properties for different minerals, (4) monitor the spectroscopic properties of adsorbed PAHs with varying solution chemistry conditions, and monitor adsorbed PAH spectroscopic properties for different surface loadings.     Results from the proposed research project  will enhance efforts to model the fate and transport of PAH in low carbon environments.  The results will also help the design of heterogeneous photolytic systems for the destruction of  PAHs.  In addition to addressing the fundamental questions of PAH-mineral surface interactions, this project will also  motivate for the development of new fluorescence and NMR techniques.",
