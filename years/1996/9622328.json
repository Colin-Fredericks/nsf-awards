 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622328  Wiens   This research equipment grant supports the purchase of components and the fabrication of a specialized platform for deburring research.   Deburring, particularly when done manually, is an expensive, time consuming, but necessary,  part of manufacturing precision parts.   Particularly for low to mid volume manufacture, it is an area that is attractive for process automation.  However, the technical problems are following a contour with a small cutter or abrasive tool, that generate no force when there is no burr and a high force when there is a burr.  The idea that these investigators want to  test out with this equipment is a synthesis of their past separate investigations. One investigation based on kinematics theory is a smart kinestatic interactive platform (SKIP), and the other studied mechanisms of burr formation and removal.  Their understanding of these two areas has led them to an innovative solution of the deburring problem that is an integration of the SKIP concept and a deburring process model.     This equipment award will provide experimental facilities for research that includes: kinematics and dynamics of micro-manipulators for smart deburring, edge chamfering and deburring process model based control, and verification of an automated finishing system.   ***",
