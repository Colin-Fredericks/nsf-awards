The facility will  support the research of seventeen  faculty members from several  departments and colleges at the University. A unifying theme of  the research is the common goal to understand the structure and  dynamics of paramagnetic states in the various materials of  interest. Major instrumentation proposed includes the upgrade of  an existing EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) spectrometer,  acquisition of pulsed ENDOR (electron-nuclear double resonance)  capabilities,  and development of a commercially-not-available  ODMR/ODENDOR (optically-detected magnetic resonance / optically-  detected electron-nuclear double resonance) spectrometer and of a  portable helium-three refrigerator for very-low-temperature EPR  applications. The instrumentation will be used to study a variety  of material systems, including photochemical reactants and matrix-  isolated molecules (Chemistry), rare-earth-doped semiconductors  (Materials Science and Engineering), low-dimensional ferromagnets  (Physics), and biological macromolecules (Pharmacology and  Therapeutics). A total of twenty-four  students and post-doctoral  associates (38% female participants) will be involved in training  and use of the instruments. The educational activity will be  formalized through a special topics course involving laboratory  work along with theoretical background for students from the  various colleges involved.  %%%  The facility will have a large impact on the research  infrastructure of the Southeastern region by creating a center of  excellence in the area of electron paramagnetic resonance. It  will complement the instrumentation available at the National  High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) in Tallahassee, and serve  as a staging post for the high field and high frequency  experiments being done at the NHMFL.  ***",
