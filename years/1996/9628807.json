 "awd_abstract_narration": "9628807  Behr  The vulnerability of building envelopes have been amply  demonstrated during recent extreme wind events which  resulted in damage to building interiors, loss of building  functions and great replacement/repair costs.  Laminated  glass units have shown significant promise for glazing  systems that resist windborne debris impacts.    A computer-based design methodology will be developed to  predict the probability of an inner glass ply fracture in a  given laminated glass unit under impacts from a design  missile traveling at a prescribed speed.  To accomplish  this, a robust structural mechanics-based predictive model  for laminated glass units with polyvinyl butyral interlayers  will be developed and verified by means of comprehensive  laboratory tests.  Project deliverables will include a  computerized design package that can be used to design and  develop cost-effective glazing systems that exhibit  \"sacrificial ply behavior,\" i.e., the outer glass ply may be  fractured, or \"sacrificed\" to windborne debris impacts, but  the interlayer/inner glass ply composite is sufficiently  resilient to protect the inner glass ply from fracturing.  Thus, the integrity of the building envelop is preserved  during the windstorm.    This project will involve a team of civil engineers,  mechanical engineers and statisticians.  Project results  will provide the research community with needed data, will  have a significant positive impact on mitigating building  envelope damage due to severe windstorms, and will benefit  building owners and building insurers in the United States.",
