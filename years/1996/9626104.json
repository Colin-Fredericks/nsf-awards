 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oster  9626104       The investigator and his colleague construct mathematical  models to describe three important classes of protein molecular  motors. (1) 'Linear' motors driven by nucleotide hydrolysis,  including (i) the kinesin and myosin superfamily which move along  microtubules and actin filaments, respectively, and (ii) HSP70,  which drives the translocation of proteins across intracellular  membranes; (ii) RNA and DNA polymerase, which move along the DNA  double helix. (2) 'Rotary' motors driven by electrochemical  gradients, including (i) ATP synthase, the mechanochemical engine  that synthesizes ATP, and (ii) the bacterial flagellar motor,  which drives the motion of many prokaryotic organisms. (3) Motors  driven by polymerization free energy, including the microtubule  depolymerization process that moves chromosomes during anaphase  mitosis, and the polymerization motors which drive the motion of  certain pathogenic bacteria and viruses, such as Listeria and  Vaccinia.  The approach in each case is to begin by formulating  analytical stochastic models consisting of Langevin mechanical  equations or Fokker-Planck diffusion equations that describe the  mechanochemical and statistical behavior of the molecular  machinery.  These models then are analyzed mathematically where  possible and by numerical simulation in all cases.  The mean  mechanical properties of these protein motors are derived, such  as force-velocity curves, along with their stochastic properties  such as trajectory variances.  Results are presented in a visual  format that facilitates comprehension by biologists and  comparison with experimental data.       The most striking feature of biological cells, and indeed  the hallmark of life itself, is their constant motion.  These  motions are of two kinds: those that move the cell from one place  to another, and those that move vital material from one place to  another within the cell.  Both kinds of motions are driven by  specialized protein molecules that function as ti ny robotic  motors, powered by chemical energy.  The world in which these  protein machines operate is dominated by Brownian motion, which  gives their movements a statistical character.  Although these  molecular machines operate on a length scale of nanometers and a  force scale of piconewtons, they are absolutely essential to the  life of the cell.  Recent advances in instrumentation have made it  possible to measure the mechanical properties of individual  protein motors, and recent advances in high-performance computing  have enabled their simulation in realistic detail, including the  effects of thermal fluctuations.  Taken together, these advances  provide an unprecedented opportunity to deduce how biomolecular  motors work.  This is done through the formulation of mathematical  models, and through the careful comparison of model predictions  with experimental data.",
