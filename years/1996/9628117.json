 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerous applications in sciences and engineering, as well as in  computational, applied and pure mathematics give rise to problems  involving matrices with Toeplitz, Hankel, Toeplitz-plus-Hankel,  Vandermonde structures, controllability, observability, Cauchy,  Loewner, Pick, Schur-Cohn, Routh-Hurwitz matrices, Bezoutians,  along with many other patterns of structure.  standard  mathematical software tools (e.g., MATLAB, MathCad, Maple V, NAG  library, LAPACK), are based on standard (structure-ignoring)  methods, and therefore their use is often not appropriate for  obtaining a satisfactory solution.  Here are two major reasons.  First, ignoring the structure artificially squares the size of  the data, which requires unnecessary storage and an extremely  large amount of CPU time.  Secondly, many structured matrices,  e.g. Hankel, Pick, Hilbert, Vandermonde, are extremely ill-  conditioned, which means that all available standard methods  often fail to produce even one correct digit in the computed  solution.  The theme of this project is the study of several theoretical and  computational problems related to Cauchy and Cauchy-like  matrices, which arise in many applied areas, including signal  processing, system Theory H-infinity control.  Use of the concept of displacement structure suggests that  algorithms for Cauchy-like matrices can be used to  design  efficient practical algorithms for many other important kinds of  structured matrices, such as Toeplitz, Hankel, Toeplitz-plus-  Hankel, Vandermonde, Chebyshev-Vandermonde matrices, etc.  In  fact, all these matrices can be transformed into Cauchy-like  matrices just by applying a few fast Fourier, cosine of sine  transforms.  It is planned to extend the results to develop fast  and numerically accurate algorithms for new classes of structured  matrices.  ***",
