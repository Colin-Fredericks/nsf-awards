 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves a Career Advancement Award to Julia E. Fulghum,   Associate Professor of Chemistry at Kent State University.  The PI is a   recognized expert in X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and the   purpose of this award is to enable her to spend a sabbatical leave at the   National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Denver, Colorado, to learn   sample preparation and data analysis for time-of-flight secondary ion   mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS).  Both XPS and TOF-SIMS are surface analysis   techniques and the information they provide is complimentary.  The PI   will be able to expand her XPS technique development to encompass   TOF-SIMS imaging with emphasis on organic and insulating samples.  Part   of the work at NREL will involve studies on photovoltaic materials   development.  In addition, the PI will be able to add TOF-SIMS capability   to her on-going research work on the surface chemistry of materials.  The   long-term goal is to add TOF-SIMS instrumentation capability in her own   laboratory.  The project is supported by the Analytical and Surface   Chemistry Program and the Special Projects Office in the Chemistry   Division.  This project will enable Professor Julia E. Fulghum to examine the   surface chemistry of important technological materials such as liquid   crystals and photovoltaics using two complementary techniques: X-ray   photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-flight-secondary ion mass   spectrometry.   Little work is available in the literature regarding such   a comparison.  Imaging is one aspect of the work and correlating   information from both techniques will aid in understanding the artifacts   and limitations of each of them.  The results of the work will contribute   to the development of solar cells for energy conversion and the   technology of optical materials.",
