 "awd_abstract_narration": "9601582  Dzenis  This is an Academic Research Infrastructure Award that provides funds to purchase a Universal Scanning Acoustic Microscope (SAM). The SAM combines microimaging, microtesting, and microscopic non-destructive evaluation devices in a single instrument. It will be dedicated to support research and education in science and engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.    Acquisition of SAM will be beneficial for a large number of current and planned research projects spanning a wide range of topics including, for example, fundamental studies and development of new polymers, metals, composites, and coatings; studies of peculiarities of chemical reactions, glass transitions, and crystallization in polymers; studies on emerging manufacturing technologies of electrical discharge machining and electrospinning; studies of evolution of microdamage in advanced heterogeneous materials and composites; studies of microdebonding at interfaces; studies on surface morphology and subsurface residual stresses; studies leading to development of smart nondestructive evaluation system, and others.  The multidisciplinary nature of the instrument is evidenced by the involvement of eleven faculty members from seven Departments in the Colleges of Engineering and Technology, Arts and Sciences, and Dentistry.  In addition to the broad research applications, the acquired system   also will be used as a laboratory device in several senior undergraduate and graduate courses. These include courses on experimental mechanics of solids, crystallog raphy, experimental composites, damage mechanics, thin films, surface finishing, machining, and others.  The user friendly computerized control and data acquisition software of the new system will allow students to concentrate on the peculiarities of mechanical behavior and microstructure of materials.  Acquisition of this sophisticated equipment will improve national research and education infrastructure.  At the present time, only a few of the top universities thro ughout the world have this new technology available in their labs. Thus the acquisition of SAM will place the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in a leading position with regard to the research areas where the unique features of this technique can be utilized.  These features include a wide range of resolutions and depths of penetration, three-dimensional microimaging, microscale non-destructive evaluation, and a combined information on geometric morphology and distribution of mechanical properties of materials. New experimental capabilities will assist in attracting quality researchers and students to UNL and will improve the quality of their experimental research training.  The acquisition of SAM is also in the interests of local industries involved with advanced and novel materials, such as Brunswick Composites, Telex, Addax, Spirotech, Cushman, and others.  SAM service is currently unavailable in Nebraska.  ***",
