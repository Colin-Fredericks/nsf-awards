 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626959  Hoitomt    Wisconsin Public Broadcasting will continue the incorporation of a science strand into \"Get Real!,\" their television series for children 8-12 year old.  The series presents positive images of children involved in, and succeeding in, a variety of areas.  The stories are field-produced; and kids are involved on-screen and off as hosts, reporters, subjects of stories, as interns during production, and as sources of story ideas.  The series is broadcast on both public and commercial stations and receives multiple repeats.      The science and technology strand:     connects science concepts to children's known experiences and activities and tells stories about kids involved in science-related activities;     models and reinforces positive attitudes towards, and involvement in science and technology and affirms the value of children's ideas, and the importance of asking why?; and     reinforces viewers' active connection to the science content by making suggestions for projects to get involved with, and by encouraging children to discuss and question their knowledge of science and the world around them.    In this third season of the series, the producers will expand coverage of the series to five additional states adjoining Wisconsin.  They are convinced they can do this without losing the local interest and participation of local institutions which has been a great factor in attracting and holding viewers.    James Steinbach, the creator, original producer, and executive producer of \"Newton's Apple,\" will be the co-PI with overall responsibility for the project.  The series is produced in the three Wisconsin Public Television studios -- in Madison, Green Bay, and Menomonie -- and, therefore, can find and produce stories which reach out into a wide geographic area.",
