 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625919  Chan    X-ray scattering provides an extremely powerful probe of the  microscopic properties of condensed materials systems.  The  proposed 3He refrigeration system and associated electronics  and gas handling components will allow us to apply X-ray  scattering techniques to materials systems at low  temperatures, in particular quantum liquids.  Such  capabilities are not available at any synchrotron x-ray  source in the world.  Thus, this 3He refrigeration system  will provide a unique and valuable facility.  The proposed  refrigeration system will be initially used for the study of  disorder and impurities in helium mixtures.  This disorder  can be introduced either through the introduction of  annealed impurities, such as 3He in 4He, or confinement in  porous glasses, such as vycor or aerogel, or both.  The  presence of disorder can have profound effects on the  critical behavior, transport properties and phase separation  of 3He-4He mixtures.  It can also modify the microscopic  structure, as reflected in the pair correlation function of  the atoms.  The research studies will directly address these  microscopic issues using x-ray scattering.  The research  will make use of either the National Synchrotron Light  Source currently operating at Brookhaven National Laboratory  or the Advanced Photon source which is under construction at  Argonne National Laboratory.  The proposed refrigeration  system will be designed with sufficient flexibility to allow  it to be used on a variety of instruments at either of these  sources.  %%%  This project will have broad scientific impact to the field  of low temperature materials research and will provide  unique capability to the important area of x-ray scattering  for the advancement of characterization of materials of  economic importance.  ***",
