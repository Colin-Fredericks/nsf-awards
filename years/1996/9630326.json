 "awd_abstract_narration": "Taste remains a poorly understood sensory system by comparison to our knowledge of nerve activity patterns and pathways in the brain for other senses.  At all levels of the taste pathways from tongue to cortex, taste neurons generally are multi-sensitive, responding to some degree to more than one of the four basic taste qualities of salty, sour, bitter and sweet.  Little is known about the central organization of response profiles for taste cells, defined as their relative sensitivities across a variety of taste stimuli.  This project uses a novel approach combining electrophysiological recording with computational techniques to study the dynamic interactions among single cells in two important taste centers in the brainstem.  Multi-site simultaneous recordings display activity patterns for ensembles of nerve cells, which are analyzed for their functional connectivity, and for the relatedness of their profiles of taste sensitivities.  In going beyond the usual single-unit studies, results will permit inferences about the interneuronal dynamics, and generate hypotheses about how excitatory and inhibitory connections among central subgroups of cells may provide mechanisms for spatial as well as temporal central coding for taste.   Results of this novel approach will have fundamental importance to better understanding taste mechanisms, which can have impact beyond basic science to the food industry; the novel techniques and the investigation of coding mechanisms will be useful beyond chemosensory science to neuroscience in general.",
