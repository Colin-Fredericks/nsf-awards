Some of the phenomena to be studied  include: (i) The relation between microscopic structure and  thermodynamic properties of two-dimensional (2D) order of  Langmuir monolayers (LM). One particularly interesting such  system will be LM of periodic amphipillic polypeptides  prepared by bacterial expression of artificial genes. (ii)  The 2D in plane order of Langmuir monolayers of fullerene  chemical derivatives on the surface of water. (iii) The  effects of chemical variations on the in-plane structure of  self assembled Langmuir monolayers of thiols on the surface  of liquid mercury and possibly gallium. (iv) The  compositional structure along the surface normal of wetting  layers of complex systems, such as binary liquids and  polymer brushes. These experiments can increase knowledge of  the properties of liquid surfaces dramatically, and have  potential commercial applications in the US and elsewhere.  %%%  The principal objective of this research program is to  explore the microscopic structure and associated statistical  properties of liquid surfaces. The project is concerned with  the development of techniques and methods that will allow  measurement of previously unobserved phenomena at the  surfaces of both bulk liquids and thin liquid films. In  contrast with the relatively comprehensive understanding of  the solid phases of matter, including their surfaces,  knowledge of the liquid phase is relatively modest. One  reason that this is true in spite of the vast literature on  liquid phases is that the lack of long-range order in bulk  liquids obviates much of the measurable phenomena that  contributed to the current understanding of the microscopic  structure of solids.  ***",
