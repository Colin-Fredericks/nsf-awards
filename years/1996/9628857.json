 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program supports research by Dr. Steven G. Boxer of the Chemistry   Department, Stanford University, for investigation of the photophysics   and reaction dynamics of coordination complexes in applied electric   fields.    A Stark spectrometer based on a step-scan FTIR will be   developed for use in obtaining high signal-to-noise virbrational Stark   effect spectra in the mid-IR region and electronic Stark spectra for the   broad transitions characteristic of coordination compounds.  Some of the   specific problems to be investigated by Stark spectroscopy include:    electronic coupling in class II mixed valence complexes and metal-bridged   prophyrin dimers; bond anharmonicity in carbonyl and C-F stretches;   degree of delocalization in push-pull polyenes (used in non-linear   optical devices)  imposed by large internal electric fields that result   from the attachment of strong electron donors and acceptors; effect of   applied electric fields on excited state proton transfer reactions in   3-hydroxyflavone.  Interactions between molecular fragments separated by relatively long and   chemically interesting spacers will be investigated using Stark effect    spectroscopy.  Electronic or vibrational transitions are affected by   applied electric fields and measurement of this effect provides   quantitative information on the magnitude and direction of charge   displacement.  Electric fields can also be used to manipulate the rates   of electron and proton transfer reactions.  The results are not only of   fundamental interest but also potentially applicable to the development   of non-linear optical materials for use in the electronics industry.",
