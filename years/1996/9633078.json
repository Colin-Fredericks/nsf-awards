The 1996 Conference will be the tenth consecutive meeting of NCBPS.   The objective of the NCBPS meeting is to assist and encourage Black  students who have shown interest and ability in physics to enter  and complete Ph.D. programs, and to initiate research, teaching, or  technical careers commensurate with their educational achievement  in physics.    NCBPS originated with a group of Black graduate students at the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  The conferences have  organized and implemented by students with faculty and staff  assistance at the various host institutions throughout the country.    Information is presented through the following mechanisms (1)  lectures by distinguished scientists and engineers, (2) technical  presentations by Black graduate and undergraduate students, (3)  workshops on the graduate admission process, (4) seminars on  financial support to students for science education at the  university level, (5) forums on successfully completing a graduate  programs in physics, and (6) career opportunities at all degree  levels.  The primary audience for the Conference consists of  undergraduate students who are majoring in physics and/or who have  expressed a sincere interest in physics.  A principal goal of the  Conference is to permit these students, ho are in the process of  making career decisions, the opportunity to discuss with graduate  students and scientists their concerns regarding a scientific  career and to seek recommendations and advice about educational  paths.",
