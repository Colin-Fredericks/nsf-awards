 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Photosynthesis Center at Arizona State University has  developed a major research program investigating fast energy and  electron transfer during solar energy conversion in both natural and  artificial systems. Ultrafast optical laser spectroscopy is a key tool  in this research effort. Six groups, representing about 40 faculty,  postdocs and students, are actively using an existing femtosecond time  resolution transient absorbance spectrometer to study bacterial, plant  and synthetic antenna and reaction center complexes. This research  includes designing and synthesizing molecular devices which mimic the  fast rates and high yields of the natural systems but are much simpler  chemically and may have applications as molecular switches and logic  gates. Also, investigation of the structurally well defined reaction  centers of the purple nonsulfur bacteria is leading towards an  understanding of the photophysics of the initial solar energy  conversion event and towards an understanding of the role played by the  protein in modifying the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of  electron transfer. Research is also underway into the light harvesting  and energy trapping reactions of the Photosystem I reaction center of  higher plants as well as in a related photosynthetic reaction center  from Heliobacillus mobilis.          A great deal of progress has been made with the present  instrument, but as the experiments performed have become more and more  sophisticated, limitations have been reached in available time  resolution, sensitivity, noise suppression, photon excitation  densities, available excitation and probe wavelengths, capabilities to  perform multiple excitation pulse experiments, and simply in the amount  of time available for each group on the apparatus. The purchase of a  new instrument is proposed with greatly expanded capabilities. Unlike  the present instrument which uses an actively mode-locked Nd:YAG laser  synchronously pumping a dye laser as the source of ultrafast pu lses,  the new system will employ a self-mode-locked titanium sapphire laser  pumped by a CW argon ion laser. The pulses from this source will be  amplified in a solid-state regenerative amplifier to the millijoule  level at kilohertz repetition rates and used to generate up to two  excitation pulses at any wavelengths between 400 nm and 2.4 rnicrons  with pulse durations of roughly 50 fs. In addition, part of the  regeneratively amplified pulse will be used to generate a white light  continuum, allowing simultaneous absorbance change measurements at many  different wavelengths in a single experiment. By using optical gating  in a nonlinear crystal, the instrument  will also have the capability of performing femtosecond time resolution  emission decay studies.          Purchase of the proposed femtosecond system will open up a number  of new research avenues for  photosynthesis investigators at ASU. New excitation wavelengths will  allow more specific preparation of molecular excited states Multiple  excitation pulses at higher photon densities will allow the creation of  specific intermediate states with one pulse whose photochemistry can  then be investigated with a second excitation event. The higher time  resolution of the system will both help in the investigation of  processes previously detected but not resolved on the 100 fs timescale  and also open up a window into the molecular vibrations of the system  coupled to the absorbance transitions and photochemistry. Higher  signal-to-noise absorbance change data will allow more thorough  investigation of natural photosynthetic systems with large numbers of  pigments whose absorbance masks the small absorbance changes associated  with the primary photochemistry of solar energy conversion.",
