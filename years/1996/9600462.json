 "awd_abstract_narration": "INT 9600462  Raikhel        This U.S.-Czech research project between Dr. Natasha Raikhel of Michigan State University and Dr. Bretislav Brzobohaty of the Czech Institute of Biophysics, Brno, will examine plant hormones that mediate features of plant development.  Specifically, the researchers intend to study the role played by subcellular compartmentation in regulation of phytohormone activity.  This will be done by reversible conjugation, using a cloned maize cytokinin glucosidase (cDNA, Zm-p60.1).  The extent of the cytokinin release will be determined in the process and the observed physiological responses caused by the released cytokinins will be analyzed.  Initial findings will contribute to the research team's efforts to construct and molecularly characterize transgenic plants that express accumulations of Zm-p60.1 in various subcellular compartments.    The research is expected to improve our fundamental understanding of the cytokinin role in the developmental switch in plants from the vegetative to the reproductive phase.  New knowledge of various effects of released cytokinins on activities such as floral transition, root development, seed production, and photosynthetic capacity may lead to results that permit control of some agriculturally important traits in crops.    This project in plant cellular science fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of mutual interests and competence.          ??",
