 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is developing conditions which will make   dimethyl carbonate an industrially viable alkylating agent for the   preparation of quaternary ammonium salts.  In a second part of the   project, the products of the alkylation reactions will be transformed   into a series of salts with varying counter ions. Thirdly,  several   biodegradable quaternary salts will be constructed as possible   alternatives to the environmentally less friendly salts now used in   commercial products.  The project will serve as platform for the    education of  undergraduate chemistry students. With this Technology for   a Sustained Environment award, the Synthetic Organic Program, as part of   the NSF/EPA Partnership, is supporting the research and educational   activities of Dr. Gary W. Earl of the Department of Chemistry at   Augustana College.  Professor Earl will focus his work on developing new   and viable methods for the production of quaternary ammonium compounds.    These compounds find wide industrial use as components of products as   diverse as fabric softeners to hair conditioning agents.  Undergraduate   chemistry majors will be exposed to the constraints of industrial   processing, both equipment and reaction conditions, as well as economic   limitations.",
