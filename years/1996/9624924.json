The research to be carried will focus on  studying the structure and evolution of our own Milky Way by comparing  observations of two distinct parts of our Galaxy, the local solar  neighborhood, and the  outer Galaxy.  The solar neighborhood is the best studied region of the  Galaxy.   The  outer Galaxy is less well understood, but its  proximity  and  differences  in physical conditions (e.g., low  gas  density,  low  metallicity) make it an ideal place to study contrasts with  the  local  neighborhood.    The  areas of study be: 1) searches for and studies of atomic  hydrogen  (HII)  regions  in the outer Galaxy; 2) a study of Galactic  abundances  and  how  they  vary  in  the  Galaxy; 3) studies  of  molecular  cloud  structure; and 4) studies of the stellar content of regions  of  active  star-formation.   A  Very  Large Array (VLA)  and  Australia  Telescope  Compact Array (ATCA) radio continuum survey of HII regions in the outer  Galaxy has begun, and this work will be continued by analyzing the data  to  determine  HII region properties.  These data can be compared  with  similar data taken in the inner Galaxy.  The survey will be carried out  to observe lower luminosity radio sources.    A study of outer Galaxy abundances (N,O,S) in HII regions measured from  the  Kuiper  Airborne Observatory.  The Infrared Satellite  Observatory  (ISO)  will  be used to observe additional lines of Ar and Ne  in  some  outer  Galaxy  HII regions, and to measure abundances in  the  furthest  known HII region at a distance of 28 kpc from the center of the Galaxy.    A  third objective will involve new molecular-line observations of  two  star-forming  regions  in the outer Galaxy in order  to  determine  the  structure  of  the molecular clouds.  In particular, it is  planned  to  measure  the spectrum of clump masses (initial clump function, or  ICF)  in  t hese clouds in order to compare with the numerous measurements  of  the ICF parameter in local clouds.    The  final objective is to obtain JHK photometry of a number of  nearby  star-forming  clouds using a near-IR camera mounted  on  the  Claremont  Colleges l-m telescope.  With this telescope and camera, entire  clouds  could  be mapped (such as rho-Oph), thereby obtaining a complete census  of  the  embedded  cluster.  Models of the observed cluster  luminosity  function  will  allow  us  to determine the  underlying  IMF.   Similar  cluster membership data for the outer Galaxy will be obtained, allowing  one  to  compare the IMF in two regions of very different  metallicity.  Also, comparison of the ICF and lMF in both the local neighborhood  and  in  the  outer  Galaxy  will  help  one understand  how  star-formation  proceeds from molecular cloud clumps to stars of various masses.    The educational component of this project will focus on course  development and modernization.  The Observational Astronomy course  offered at Harvey Mudd College has, in the past, neglected including  recent advances in non-optical astronomy.  New lecture material and  computer laboratories are being developed to introduce non-optical data  into the course.  The Advanced Astronomy course will be redesigned into  a series of topical half-semester courses (e.g., Star-formation and the  Interstellar Medium, Cosmology, Extragalactic Astronomy, Galactic  Structure, etc.) to introduce modern astronomical topics into the  curriculum and to increase student interest in advanced Astronomy.  The  educational component of this project will also continue K-12 outreach  work begun in the last year, through a partnership with two local  Claremont School District teachers.",
