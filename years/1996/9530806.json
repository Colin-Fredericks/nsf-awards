A major process affecting the growth and evolution of planetary  bodies is hypervelocity impact.  Although some of the  basic  principles of impact phenomena are moderately well understood,  how material fragments near the impact site and how initial  conditions affect that fragmentation have been difficult to  quantify.  Also, the dependence of fragmentation outcome on  target size is not well defined.  Dr. Ryan and colleagues have  developed and tested a two-dimensional Lagrangian hydrocode for  modeling collisional fragmentation.  Since gravitational effects  are incorporated into the code, it is highly useful in the  simulation of large-scale impact events beyond the reach of  laboratory studies.  The ability to characterize the outcome of  an impact event of any size given a particular set of initial  conditions is applicable to many problems: asteroid impacts on  planetary surfaces, collisional evolution of the asteroid belt,  asteroid family formation, planetesimal accretion, ring particle  dynamics, and meteorite delivery mechanisms, for example.    The goal of Dr. Ryan's present study is to improve the modeling  of impact events by modifying  the 2-dimensional code to include  the effect of target porosity/internal fractures.  The code will  then be extended to 3 dimensions during the second funding year.  The results of this modeling will be applied to better undertand  collisions in the Solar System, primarily the problem of the  formation of asteroid families.  ====================================================",
