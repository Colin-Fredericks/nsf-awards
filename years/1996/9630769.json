 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630769  Rohrmann  Sequences used by the baculovirus, Autographa californica,  to initiate in vivo DNA replication will be identified and characterized. Interactions between different components of the replication complex will be characterized and their roles in DNA replication determined. A gene, ie-1, which is essential for DNA replication and is a transactivator of early gene transcription will be characterized. Its interactions with replication origin sequences will be investigated and the domains involved in these functions mapped. The replication origins used by baculoviruses in vivo will be mapped and the structural and functional requirements of a replication origin will be determined.  %%%  Relatively little is known about the origins of replication in eukaryotic cells or about the factors that control initiation at the many origins of replication found in the genomes of such cells. Baculoviruses provide a model for eukaryotic genome replication origins because, in contrast to other viruses, they do have multiple origins of replication. Moreover, they are used as expression systems for the production of properly modified recombinant proteins and because late gene promoters used to express recombinant proteins depend on DNA replication a better understanding of replication in these viruses could lead to the development of improved baculovirus expression systems.  ***",
