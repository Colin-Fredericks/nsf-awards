 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation project examines a little studied but prominent aspect of the scientific encounter between Europeans and Chinese in the British naturalists interest in and investigation of the natural history of China.  Its objectives are to understand (1) the interactions between the naturalists and the local Chinese community involved in their scientific activities and (2) the process of interpreting new data and the translation between the different traditions of natural history.  The project involves extensive research into primary and secondary sources in both English and Chinese.  Much of the material has not been examined in depth by historians.  The results of this project promise to deepen our understanding of the issues of science and mperialism and comparative studies of scientific traditions.",
