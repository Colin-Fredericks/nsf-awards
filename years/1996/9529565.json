 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Number: ECS-9529565    Principal Investigator:  Noah Hershkowitz/University of Wisconsin    Title:  Helicon Wave Studies    In this research, a high density helicon plasma source will be developed. The helicon plasma source is anticipated as the highest density plasma source for semiconductor plasma processing applications. In these experiments the high density helicon source will be generated through use of increased rf-power and multiple antennas to couple efficiently to all regimes of the helicon dispersion relation: one antenna for low power operation in the collisionless regime to initiate the plasma and a second antenna operating at higher power to increase helicon plasma density in the collisional regime.  A short pulse (10 ms) of 50 kW of rf will be injected via the second antenna into a low power steady state to obtain densities of > 1014 cm-3.  In addition to providing a high density large volume plasma source, these experiments will test the parameter scalings and physical models in regimes not fully explored.   The non-appearance of the m=-1 mode, an open fundamental question, will be especially explored using an antenna configuration designed to force its generation.  A very important part of the proposed research is the development of new diagnostics needed for such high density plasmas. Diagnostics for these experiments will include a ruby laser Thompson scattering system for electron temperature measurements, to replace the Langmuir probes which would not operate under the experimental conditions; and a microwave interferometry system available from he Phaedrus-B Tandem mirror to allow measurement of wave dispersion.  Segmented endloss detectors, retarding field energy analyzers, and Pt grid bolometric radiation detectors will provide data to determine power scaling and power balance of the high density pulsed plasma.",
