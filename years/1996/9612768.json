 "awd_abstract_narration": "IRI-9612768         This award funds a research-planning workshop that is  intended to discuss promising new and emerging applications for  robotics, and to identify research needs to facilitate the  realization of those applications.  The workshop is co-sponsored  by the Robotics Industries Association and by the IEEE Robotics  and Automation Society.  It is be held in Santa Fe,  New Mexico,  in November 1996.  The Robotics and Machine Intelligence Program  of NSF  has long had a strategic objective of supporting research  that would enhance robotics system performance and usability,  thereby gaining acceptance and adoption of robotics technologies  across a broad spectrum of application domains.  The workshop  aims to establish or enhance connections between technology  researcher/developers and potential end users, leading to  stimulation of  research of increased strategic value.  Thus, the  design of the workshop includes involvement of lots of industry  participants, primarily representing end-users, with a few  robotics vendors, and a number of  academic researchers.  Discussion groups will address needs identification, research  identification, and  research transition.  Several planned  publications from the workshop should assure wide dissemination  of  the findings and recommendations.",
