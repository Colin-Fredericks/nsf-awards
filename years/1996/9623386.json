The support will enhance the dissertation of Carolyn Ferguson who is a graduate student with Dr. Robert Jansen at University of Texas, Austin.  The student's dissertation project involves phylogenetic analysis of molecular sequence data for taxa in the Phlox pilosa species complex.  This group of plants is of particular interest because it has been suggested that some of the taxa are of hybrid origin at the diploid level, a speciation mechanism that is presumed to be rare and bears further investigation.  Data will be obtained for chloroplast restriction site analysis and nuclear ITS sequencing and incongruities in the resultant phylogenies should illuminate the question of diploid hybrid origins.  In addition, molecular markers will be utilized in detailed population level studies for a case study of putative Phlox diploid hybridization in the southeastern United States.    This award will provide support for a graduate student pursuing studies of relationships among plants in a species complex including taxa believed to be of diploid hybrid origin.  Careful population level analysis will document this interesting and believed rare mechanism for the origin of species. Support for the training of graduate students in modern systematic and population biology methodologies is important for maintaining the workforce of scientists capable of addressing the questions and issues of biodiversity which are of increasing global concern.",
