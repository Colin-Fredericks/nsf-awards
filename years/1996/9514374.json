 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nunez  9514374      The brain and its cells are unique in their ability to change in  response to their internal surroundings and the animal's  experiences.  This ability to adapt can be demonstrated at the  molecular, cellular and behavioral levels.  One of the most plastic  cells in the brain are not even nerve cells, but are peripherally  derived mast cells.  The mast cells and glial elements provide an  enriched environment in which the nerve cells function.  However,  much is unknown about the mast cells in brain especially their  function and anatomy.  Dr. Nunez is assessing the ability of  daylength, a strong environmental cue, to alter the anatomy of  brain mast cells and their central nervous system location.  These  investigations lay the foundation for studies on the influence of  mast cells on adaptive behaviors and other neurochemical changes.   These investigations will provide significant basic information  about the interplay between the environment and brain function.   This information will then be used to further understand the how  environmental factors increase or decrease species survivability in  the wild or captivity.",
