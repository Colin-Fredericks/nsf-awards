 "awd_abstract_narration": "David Coker is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research in nonadiabatic   molecular dynamics in condensed systems.  Coker is combining    nonadiabatic switching formalism with surface hopping theory to study   energy redistribution between quantum and classical subsystems.  This has   resulted in a new approach for treating nonadiabatic dynamics in   condensed phase systems.  Additional new methods will be developed for   simulating systems with few nonadiabatic quantum degrees of freedom in   the presence of a classical bath degrees of freedom.  Applications which   explore nuclear nonadiabaticity include: 1) studies of the effects of   solvent density on the nonadiabatic rotational dynamics of hydrogen   molecule in solution and the influence they have on rotational Raman   linewidths; 2) the influence of nonadiabatic dynamics and tunneling on   transport of hydrogen molecule in ice; and 3) studies of solution phase   intermolecular proton transfer reactions and the effects of solvent   polarization and planarity on tunneling and nonadiabaticity of proton   dynamics.  Electronic nonadiabaticity in solution phase reactions will be   studied by the introduction of a semi-empirical valence bond approach   called diatomics in molecules.  This approach will be used to study early   time nonadiabatic dynamics after photoexcitation of diatomic iodine,   diatomic iodine anion, and methyl iodide in various molecular solvents.  Since most industrial synthetic processes occur in solution, it is   important to gain an increased understanding of the influence which   solvent has on fundamental chemical processes in solvated systems   including molecular transport, proton transfer, and electronic   excitation.  This theoretical research will lead to an improved   understanding of the factors which influence chemical reactions in   solution.",
