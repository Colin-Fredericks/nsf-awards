 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625683  HANSELL         WEATHERBIRD II is a general purpose research vessel owned and  operated by the Bermuda Biological Station for Research, Inc.  The  1996 schedule for R/V WBII has a total of 170 operating days, of  which 148 are in support of NSF-sponsored research.  The vessel  operates mainly off the coast of Bermuda.         Bermuda is the site of one of the two U.S. JGOFS funded time-  series stations, the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS).   This program is scheduled for 99 days and is in the third year of  a five year program.  Additional programs conduct research on an  ancillary basis on the BATS cruises.  In addition to BATS the WBII  will support the biweekly Hydrostation S sampling program, which  has been conducted for the past 40 years.         The WBII is part of the UNOLS fleet that supports  oceanographic research.  These vessels do not operate in the same  manner as general cargo or fishing vessels.  NSF supports the  operation of a variety of these vessels specifically dedicated to  oceanographic research and operated by universities and research  institutes around the country.",
