 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a study to determine the sequence and  chronology of events that led to the development of the Antarctic  ice sheet.  A continental-scale ice sheet probably first  developed in East Antarctica close to the Eocene-Oligocene  boundary under temperate climatic conditions.  The purpose of  this project is to determine, from landscape analysis (with a  numerical chronology), when (and why) these early temperate  conditions gave way to a polar environment in Antarctica.  From  previous field work and recent photographic analysis, an  extensive relict landscape (older than 17 million years) with  landforms and erosional features characteristic of temperate  glaciation has been delineated.  This relict landscape has been  called the Sessrumnir erosion surface and it extends over three  degrees of latitude and covers almost 10,000 km2 in three fault  blocks of the Transantarctic Mountains (Convoy, Dry Valleys,  Royal Society).  It is on this relict land surface that data will  be collected which record Middle and Early Miocene glacial  history and paleoclimate.  The results should allow an  identification of the transition from temperate to polar  conditions.  This work will involve landscape analysis,  stratigraphy of glacial deposits, and Argon-40/Argon-39 dating of  volaanic ashfalls.  Denudation rates will come from fission-track  analyses and from exposure-age analyses of bedrock surfaces and  erratic boulders.  The overall results will elucidate the origin  and stability of the polar Antarctic cryosphere.",
