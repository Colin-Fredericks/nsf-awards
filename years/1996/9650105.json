 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns the acquisition of a safe, reliable, and cost-effective DNA sequencing instrument that can be used in undergraduate education and research. The evolving biotechnology curriculum in the Department of Biological Sciences has three components: recombinant DNA techniques, the generation of genetic sequence information, and the analysis and manipulation of genetic information.   The project focuses on meeting the instrumentation needs of the second component by obtaining a fluorescent-based DNA sequencer that uses a new capillary matrix electrophoresis technology. This instrument meets all of the project's requirements in being safe (no radioactive nucleotides and no acrylamide gels), reliable (fluorescent nucleotide chemistry is a standard technology in the genome projects), and cost-effective (DNA sequencing reactions are performed using a polymerase chain reaction sequencing kit at a cost of about $5 per reaction).   All biology undergraduate students can learn how biotechnology is performed by gaining hands-on experience in structured required laboratory class exercises and in doing independent, faculty-sponsored research projects. For students to prepare for the careers of the future and for their taking on leadership roles after graduation, it is imperative that undergraduate students majoring in biology have a firm understanding of what biotechnology is and how this discipline is affecting science and society.",
