 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Natural Sciences is enhancing the undergraduate chemistry laboratory curriculum by offering all freshman engineering, science, and chemistry students, at all levels, experimental work in the area of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GCD). Two hundred freshmen in the freshman chemistry laboratory, each year, are able to use this instrument in relevant experiments.   Acquisition of GCD equipment strengthens each of the laboratory courses currently offered. It is important that students progressing through the chemistry curriculum have the opportunity to use this modern instrumental technique; therefore, training of chemistry majors on modern instrumentation is being insured.   The relevance of GCD in isotope analysis and environmental studies of air pollutants such as freons is being introduced in University Chemistry and is continued through Organic Chemistry and Advanced Synthesis, where reaction product structure determination and identification is enhanced by the use of this instrument. In Physical Chemistry, students use GCD for the calculation of thermodynamic properties and Arrhenius reaction rate parameters. In Instrumental Analysis, additional experiments in quantitative measurement of trace contaminants in air, soil, and water are offered.   Laboratory instruction is being supported by the use of computers and software already available in mass spectra interpretation. Students in the new environmental chemistry program also benefit from the use of the instrument for environmental studies.   Use of GCD equipment in University Chemistry Lab, a key component of the introductory course, encourages strong student interest and leads to improved recruitment, retention, and training of motivated and qualified chemistry majors.",
