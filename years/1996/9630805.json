 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630805  Norekian    All animals are engaged in a wide variety of behaviors. Many  behaviors are mutually exclusive since they follow different  goals and  might involve opposite movements of the same body parts.  Given a choice  between two or more behaviors at the same time, one behavior  usually takes  precedence over the others. This behavior is considered to  be dominant  over the other behaviors. Unrelated and competing behaviors  are organized  in a priority sequence in each animal, termed a behavioral  hierarchy.  Understanding of how a behavioral choice is made, why  switching between  different behaviors occurs and what are the neural  mechanisms which  reorganize the behavioral repertoire of all animals in a  hierarchical  manner represents a central issue in behavioral  neurobiology.    Most advantageous for investigation of this issue are  preparations  in which behaviors are relatively simple and well defined  and the  underlying neural circuits are identified and characterized.  Invertebrate  preparations were found to be particularly useful for these  neuroethological investigations. The pteropod mollusc Clione  limacina  appears to be an excellent model system for such  neuroethological studies  since it has a few basic, very well-defined, mutually  exclusive behaviors,  such as feeding, withdrawal, escape swimming, egg laying and  mating, as  well as relatively simple, well-studied neural circuits  producing them.  The simplicity of the preparation, including its behaviors  and underlying  neural circuits, makes it possible to draw direct  connections between the  activities of individual neurons and behavioral outputs.  This task is much  more difficult, if at all possible, in complex organisms  such as  vertebrates.    A focused investigation of one simple animal by the present  project  will enable an integrated understanding of neural  interactions and  modulatory changes in the central nervous system which  underlie the  behavioral choice and dominance of one behavior over  others.  Knowledge of  neural circuits producing specific behaviors in Clione  allows the timely  description of interconnections between neural networks,  that determine  the reorganization of the behavioral repertoire in a  priority sequence  (behavioral hierarchy). The main principals of this  reorganization and the  underlying neural mechanisms appear to be similar not only  among  invertebrates including Clione, but also in vertebrate  animals. Therefore,  knowledge obtained in the Clione preparation would have  broad theoretical  value.",
