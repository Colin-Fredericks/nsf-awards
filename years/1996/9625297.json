 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the design of approximation  algorithms for NP-hard problems arising in two important  application areas:  (1) design of networks and (2)  computational molecular biology.  The work involves  the development of general techniques to solve classes of  problems in both areas, applying and extending tools from  the area of approximation algorithms, such as the primal-  dual schema, bicriteria formulations and approximations,  and using graph-theoretic arguments in the proof of  performance guarantee. In particular, the issues addressed  in the area of network design include improved algorithm  for minimum-cost survivable network design by extending the  primal-dual method, and a generalization of the Steiner  tree problem with covering requirements.  In the area of  computational molecular biology, the areas of investigation  include the application of bicriteria approximation methods  to the physical map assembly problem, and fundamental  questions in multiple sequence alignments -- local, global  and tree based.  The Integrated Educational Plan of this  CAREER Grant includes (a) participating as Resident  Scientist in the DIMACS High School Teacher Education  Program in Computational Biology, (b) developing a``more  modern'' undergraduate cross-disciplinary computational  biology at CMU, (c) establishing and running a graduate  research seminar for doctoral students in the Algorithms,  Combinatorics and Optimization Doctoral Program at CMU, and  (d) developing new graduate courses in network design and  approximation algorithms.***",
