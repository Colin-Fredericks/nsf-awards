 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Project is directed at upgrading three existing undergraduate laboratory courses in archaeology through acquisition of basic geophysical remote-sensing equipment and enhancement of undergraduate teaching, student training, and student experience with geophysical field and lab technology. Archaeological field and lab methods are taught in a cycle of three established courses conducted by the applicant at the Department of Anthropology. The courses include Introduction to Field and Lab Methods in Archaeology, Field And Lab Experience in Archaeology, and Collection and Data Analysis in Archaeology.   The set of three lab courses offers students the up-to-date methods and technology essential to archaeology. The project is dedicated to the introduction of practical contemporary applications of geophysical Remote Sensing as vital nondestructive surveying and sampling technology for archaeology.   Previously, geophysical remote-sensing technologies have been discussed only in the lab and field series in archaeology as an integral part of field survey and sampling. No appropriate geophysical equipment has been available for field and lab teaching, training, and practical student experimentation and testing, apart from GPS instrumentation and manual surveying equipment.",
