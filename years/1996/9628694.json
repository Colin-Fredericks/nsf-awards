 "awd_abstract_narration": "9628694  Heuer    The proposed research contains three topics: i) Deformation  twinning in undoped monoclinic zirconia (m-ZrO2 ) single  crystals and polycrystals as a function of load, orientation  and temperature will be studied using microhardness  indentation. At temperatures up to 1100C, m-ZrO2 is the  stable phase.  The competition between indent-induced slip  and twinning will be studied; ii) Heating these crystals  into the tetragonal (t) phase field will allow similar  studies in t-ZrO2; here, the emphasis will be on slip  systems, the competition between slip and ferroelastic  deformation, and the role the indentation damage plays in  nucleating the martensitic t to m transformation on cooling;  iii) A bio-inspired chemical route to thin film formation of  pure and Y203-doped ZrO2 has been discovered.  The aqueous  chemistry needed to optimize film formation will be  systematically studied.. Deposition of ZrO2-based films on  semiconductor grade Si and Ni-base alloys have implications  for oxygen sensors and thermal barrier coatings,  respectively.    The proposed research will examine the fundamental  mechanical behavior of zirconia-based ceramics.  Zirconia  has been used as a  model system for understanding  toughening in a number of other tough ceramics.  This  proposal includes three research topics: deformation  twinning in 1) monoclinic and 2) tetragonal zirconia studied  by microhardness indentation, and 3) a study of the  chemistry to optimize the deposition of self-assembling thin  films of zirconia-based ceramics.   Understanding these self-  assembling films has the potential to enable materials  researchers to deposit a film of any material on any  substrate.",
