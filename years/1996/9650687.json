 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rheological (flow and deformation) properties of polymers are the most important factors affecting the microstructure of polymers, critical process parameters for polymer production and processing, and subsequent product quality. The focus of this project is the acquisition of a computer-instrumented laboratory capillary rheometer (LCR) and on-line process rheometer (OLPR) such that students can experimentally investigate and observe the rheological phenomena of plastics through laboratory testing and on-line process monitoring.   Several laboratory experiments have been planned to allow students to use the state-of-the-art LCR/OLPR equipment to study (1) the effects of processing parameters on the rheological properties of a polymer melt during processing and on the mechanical and physical properties of final products, (2) process monitoring, control, optimization, and automation, (3) the application of computer-instrumented technology in rheometry, (4) the application of the LCR/OLPR in recycling and processability analysis, (5) rheological data analysis using statistical techniques, and (6) the integration of the LCR/OLPR with computer-assisted design, manufacture, and engineering.   The LCR/OLPR project greatly enhances both the materials engineering and polymer processing programs in the Manufacturing Systems Engineering and Mechanical Engineering curricula. It can directly affect students enrolled in the following two courses: Engineering Materials and Polymer Processing. Data provided from the LCR/OLPR equipment can be beneficial to all courses in which discussions focus upon the relationship between the rheological, physical, and mechanical properties of polymeric materials, such as Material Characterization, Polymer Science, Adhesive Technology and Applications, and Industrial Painting Technology.",
