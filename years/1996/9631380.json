 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Andrew B. Bocarsly of the Chemistry Department, Princeton University,   is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program for research on the photochemistry and photophysics of   multielectron charge transfer reactions.  A multimetal cyano-bridged   Pt(IV) system has been shown to undergo a two-electron charge transfer   reaction after photoexcitation.  This system will be studied in detail in   order to gain better understanding of the primary controlling process.    The electronic and molecular structure of the primary photoproduct will   be determined using high speed laser spectroscopy. The degree of   delocalization associated with the charge transfer state will be   determined, as well as the role of solvent.  This information will be   used to synthesize new cyano-bridged multinuclear systems in order to   provide molecular control over the observed charge transfer chemistry.  Materials in which electrons are mobilized after being activated by light   are technologically important.  In this project, the structural details   of the effect of reaction with light on a series of compounds will be   determined.  Attempts will be made to extend the lifetime of the material   so that further photoactivation can take place.  This fundamental   research project will improve capability to utilize solar energy for the   formation of useful fuels and fine chemicals and to develop nonlinear   optical materials.",
