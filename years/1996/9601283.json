 "awd_abstract_narration": "9601283  Kolesar    A high-vacuum, thin-film deposition system and a microelectronic integrated circuit (IC) photolithographic mask aligner with a sub-micron resolution capability will be purchased.  Both instruments are fundamental to the well established technology of microelectronic device fabrication and the emerging field of microelectromechanical sensors and actuators. The acquisition of these two instruments will facilitate accomplishing a long-term micosensor research thrust by the principal investigator, three senior faculty research personnel, and a team of engineering students who master their functionality in a related microelectronic device fabrication research oriented laboratory experience.    The scientific and engineering goal of this research project is to synergistically integrate the well-established technology of integrated circuit microelectronics with the emerging field of micromachining to design, fabricate, characterize, and optimize the performance of a complete microdynamical chemical analysis gas chromatography + dielectric and ion mobility spectroscopy (GC+D&IMS) system that is the microscale derivative of its conventional, large-scale, analytical chemistry, laboratory counterpart.    Successful accomplishment of this research will significantly advance the comprehensive goal of using autonomous microsensors to selectively detect and monitor the concentrations of a host of atmospheric environmental pollutants.  By leveraging the inherent cost-effective advantages of IC fabrication techniques, the micromachined GC system will emerge as an advanced analytical chemistry tool with numerous applications in environmental, commercial and military settings.  ***",
