 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Reuben Simoyi, Department of Chemistry, West Virginia University, is   supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of   the Chemistry Division for studies of the oxidation mechanisms of sulfur   compounds. Dr. Simoyi will study the kinetics and mechanisms of oxidation   of selected sulfur compounds including thioureas, sulfinic acids,   sulfonic acids, sulfide, and dimethyl sulfide.  Oxidation of biologically   relevant sulfur containing compounds including taurine, cysteine,   isethionic acid, methionine and glutathione will also be investigated.    The ultimate goal is a more complete description of chemical oscillators   involving sulfur compounds, and an understanding of the pattern formation   and symmetry-breaking bifurcations of these compounds.  Techniques such   as stopped and continuous flow methods, relaxation spectra, turbidimetry,   EPR and NMR will be utilized. These systems are relevant to an   understanding of sulfur abatement procedures in environmental pollution,   and the amino acid studies may provide fundamental insights into their   physiological importance.  Sulfur is a unique element in the periodic table because it can occur in   widely varying oxidation states (from -2 to +6), and it is thus quite   reactive with metals, nonmetals and with organic compounds. These   characteristics contribute to the environmental concerns associated with   oxides of sulfur, which themselves are major atmospheric pollutants which   can cause acid rain.  The detailed reactivity of these and other sulfur   compounds, especially those with environmental and biological   significance, is not well understood.  This project will help to   elucidate the unusual reactivity patterns observed for these sulfur   compounds, and will thus contribute to a broader understanding of their   role in these important areas.",
