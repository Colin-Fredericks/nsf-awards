Included are both protein and RNA enzymes that act on nucleic acids.  While focused on cleavage and modification of nucleic acids, the meeting is designed to attract a broad cross-disciplinary spectrum of scientists from the U.S. and abroad.  These include  chemists biochemists, structural and molecular biologists, geneticists and cell biologists.  This meeting  will be  the second meeting of the Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology (FASEB) in this general topic area, the last having been held in 1993.  Since then, there has been an explosion in our understanding of the structure, mechanism and regulatory  potential of  these molecules.  The upcoming FASEB meeting is therefore both timely and topical. The organizers have selected discussion leaders for the 9 sessions, in addition to the keynote speaker for an additional session.  Speakers range from Nobel prize-winners at the forefront of their fields to accomplished young scientists destined to make inroads in their specialty areas.  The topics to be covered at the meeting are as  follows:  Nuclease Structure and Function; Modifying Enzymes - Biochemistry and Genetics; Restriction Systems; Synthetic Enzymes; Endonucleases of Mobile Elements; Endonucleases in  Recombination and Repair;  Catalysis of and by RNA; Biological Roles of Nucleic Acid Modifications; and Nucleases in Genome Research.  Additionally, there will be a poster competition which will give students and post docs with winning posters the opportunity to present a talk.  Although specialty meetings are held in the different program areas, this particular interdisciplinary mix of topics is unprecedented, and promises a unique opportunity for fertile scientific exchange between scientists with interests in both basic research and biotechnology  %%%  Nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, are the molecules of life.  DNA  forms the genetic material, the blueprint of each living cell.  Messages are sent from the DNA to the cell via RNA.  Biological catalysts called enzymes are required for the DNA to be duplicated, copied into RNA, and modified to perform the cellular functions in an orderly and coherent way.  The enzymes that act on  nucleic acids, the pivotal molecules in cellular  information flow, form the topic of this meeting.  Confirmed speakers include a broad cross-disciplinary spectrum of scientists from the US and abroad.  These scientists are at the forefront of their field, be they Nobel  laureates (of which there are two on the program) or accomplished young researchers, starting to make breakthroughs in their specialty areas.  To promote the careers of  young scientists, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will be selected at the meeting to also give platform talks.  In addition, poster sessions will accommodate work that cannot be included in the platform  presentations, thereby broadening the scope of  the meeting.  The interdisciplinary mix of scientists at the meeting will include chemists, biochemists, structural and molecular biologists, geneticists and cell biologists from academic, government and industrial settings.  The meeting, which is sponsored by the Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology (FASEB), therefore promises a unique opportunity for fertile scientific exchange between scientific exchange between scientists with a broad range of interests in both basic research and biotechnology.  ***",
