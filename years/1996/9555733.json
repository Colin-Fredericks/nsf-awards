The students will learn with technology as opposed to learning about technology in the areas of chemistry, biology, physics, and materials science imaging.  Participants will have the opportunity to construct accurate internal models of atomic structures using active, hands-on interfaces as opposed to looking at pictures or manipulating computer models.  The lab activities will use household and everyday objects that move the participant from the macro- to the micro- and finally to the subatomic size range, instilling confidence in her ability to measure, infer, and model these complex structures.  Future science teachers, middle- and high school teachers, and community college and university faculty will gain experience, producing materials for their courses and having opportunities to mentor young women and engage in peer dialog.        Hands-on experiences using technically sophisticated equipment will help students and K- 1 2 teachers learn more about the structure of matter.  Participants in this project will use telescopes, microscopes, and electron microscopes to examine household items.  Students and teachers will gain confidence in their ability to measure and make subatomic models of these everyday objects.    . . .",
