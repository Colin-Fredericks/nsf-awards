 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Fontijn  9632492    The proposed work represents an extension of the PIs current program to provide rate coefficient and mechanistic data for individual reactions of toxic metal species up to high temperatures which are of importance in incineration processes.  In the previous work the reactions of Cu, Cr, Sn and Cd with oxidants such as N2O, O2 , Cl2, and HCl were investigated as a function of temperature using three unique types of apparatus.  A semi- empirical configuration interaction (SECI) theory was also developed to help correlate the experimental results.    The proposed program will extend the experimental effort to include reactions of Ni, Pb, Sb, and As in elemental, oxide and chloride forms with HCl, O2, CO2, and H2O, as a function of temperature, using the High Temperature Flow Reactor (HTFF), Metals High Temperature Photochemistry (MHTP) apparatus and a mass spectrometer HTFF combination.  These studies will be complimented by further development of the semi-predictive theories SECI and MTST (metals transition state theory) in order to extend and compare with the experimental data.",
