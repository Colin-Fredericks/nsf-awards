 "awd_abstract_narration": "9633456  Martens      The burial and preservation of organic matter on the continental  margins of the world ocean is a process of global importance.  In  fact, burial out of direct contact with the atmosphere is  responsible not only for the deposits of fossil organic matter  found throughout the world but also for the persistence of  molecular oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere. Understanding the  factors impacting the decomposition, preservation, and burial of  perimarine organic matter has understandably been one of the  classical problems of low-temperature geochemistry.    In this project, a group of biogeochemists will be continuing their  work on this problem of environmental and economic importance.  In  this next phase of their research, the focus will be on the  relationship of organic matter decomposition and preservation to  organic sorption onto sedimentary grains with large surface areas  per unit mass (essentially the very finest components of sediments,  such as clay minerals). They will carry out laboratory experiments  to complement studies of organic sedimentation, decomposition, and  burial and four contrasting inner-shelf field sites characterized  by different types and rates of organic input as well as different  microbiological and sedimentological characteristics. The  researchers expect that this approach will lead to an improved  quantitative understanding of the relationship of organic  preservation to such variables as organic deposit rate, differences  in microbial decomposition processes, adsorption and desorption of  dissolved organic matter on mineral grains, and burial rate.",
