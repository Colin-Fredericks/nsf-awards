 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600118  Wright   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project from Consultec Scientific, Inc. seeks to develop a computer simulator that can be used in place of actual radiation sources.  The consequence of the availability of such a simulator will be a substantial reduction in the cost of training, provision for a wider variety of training situations, and elimination of the safety hazards associated with actual radiation sources.  Consultec Scientific proposes to build a computer system that will simulate the presence of various types of radiation sources in a variety of environments.  The Phase I effort showed that the concept of radiation calculations \"on the fly\" in a two-dimensional space is feasible.  The Surveyor module developed in Phase I allows a user to create a radiation environment on the computer screen and conduct a radiation \"survey,\" interacting with software and hardware instruments.  The Phase II effort will make it possible to use the simulator in three-dimensional space.  The project will develop a wireless, hand-held version of the hardware instrument for untethered operation; incorporate a three-dimensional location detection system for location of the wireless hardware device; and create two other software modules (Radiation Physics Laboratory and Examiner).  These combined components will result in a comprehensive radiation simulator that will remove radioactive sources from the training environment and reduce the amount of radiation to which students and faculty are exposed.   This simulator is expected to have numerous commercial applications and to make a major impact on health physics training.  It will improve the efficiency and productivity of training activities in nuclear medicine, nuclear power production, nuclear research, nuclear weapon production and disposal, environmental restoration, and waste management.",
