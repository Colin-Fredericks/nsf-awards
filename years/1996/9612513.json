The 1996 Symposium incorporated major new themes: 1) to enable minority faculty to present papers on strategies for increasing the number of CISE-discipline students from underrepresented populations and to share these topics with  representatives from major research universities, and 2) to provide for inclusion of student participants, giving them valuable experience in presenting research papers and providing for their participation in graduate study workshops.  Participants were chosen by a selection committee following submission of their papers.  A Conference Proceedings is being published containing all of the papers presented at the conference.",
