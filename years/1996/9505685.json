 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arteries with high grade stenoses may collapse under  physiological conditions.  The collapse may lead to accelerated  fatigue and rupture of the fibrous cap of the plaque into the  bloodstream with subsequent blockage of small arteries  downstream.  That can lead directly to heart attacks and strokes.  The  investigator and his colleague use mathematical, computational  and  experimental methods to study this collapsing process.  Mathematical models have been limited primarily to  one-dimensional  models because of the difficulty in handling the collapsing tube,  whose shape is unknown and changing.  A three-dimensional  nonlinear viscous mathematical model with free moving boundaries  is introduced and a novel numerical method is developed to solve  the model.  The numerical method uses solutions of the longwave  asymptotic expansions as the numerical initial condition and a  boundary-iterative method to find the unknown moving boundary and  the flow velocity and pressure.  Experiments are performed to  define the pressure-area relationship (tube law) for the elastic  tube models and to quantify the exact pressure-flow conditions  for  tube collapse in a laboratory set-up.  The laboratory experiments  and in vivo measurements provide data for the formulation and  verification of the mathematical model.  The validated model  together with its numerical solutions form a basis for further  investigations of the collapsing process.  Results obtained will  be useful for early detection and prevention of stenoses,  identifying the causes of rupture of plaque caps, and quantifying  physiological conditions under which collapse may occur.  While  physiological dimensions of the carotid arteries and related  parameter ranges are used in the computations and experiments,  the  methods developed in this project will be useful in a broad range  of applications where free moving boundaries are involved.       Plaque collecting in an artery can narrow it; this narrowing  is called a stenosis.  Just like wat er flowing in a narrowed  channel, the blood will flow faster past a stenosis.  In certain  conditions, this can cause the artery to collapse.  Then the  plaque may break up in the bloodstream and subsequently block  small arteries downstream.  That can lead directly to heart  attacks and strokes.  The investigators study this collapsing  process, using mathematical, computational and experimental  methods.  Previous models have been limited primarily to  one-dimensional models because of the difficulty in handling the  collapsing tube, whose shape is unknown and changing.  This  project develops a three-dimensional mathematical model that  accounts for the blood flow and the change in shape of the  collapsing artery, and a novel numerical method to solve the  model.  One of the investigators conducts experiments to  determine  the pressure-area relationship (tube law) for the elastic tube  models and the exact pressure-flow conditions for tube collapse  in  a laboratory set-up.  The laboratory experiments and in vivo  measurements provide data for the formulation and verification of  the mathematical model.  Results obtained will be useful for  early  detection and prevention of stenoses, identifying the causes of  pupture of plaque caps, and physiological conditions under which  collapse may occur.  The numerical methods developed in this  project will be useful in other applications where free moving  boundaries are involved.",
