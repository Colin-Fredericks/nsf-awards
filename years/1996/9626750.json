 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ying    The research develops statistical models, methodologies and  related theory to address issues arising from design,  modeling and analysis of survival data,  which are often subject to censoring, truncation and/or  other types of missingness. It introduces new hazard-based  regression models for survival data that extend and  complement the standard proportional hazards regression,  and yet still possess essential good features that the  latter has. Besides the usual right-censored data, it  also provides solutions to such important and difficult  problems as interval censoring, random effects and  multivariate survival times by exploiting model variation  and developing suitable analytic tools. It involves finding  computationally convenient representations and establishing  sharp theoretical properties for the analysis of discrete  (survival) data, particularly of those that can be summarized  by two-by-two or more general contingency tables. New methods  and theory tailored to retrospective studies, which are often  summarized as the case-control and case-cohort regression problems,  are also developed.    Survival data are collected in many scientific  investigations, including biomedical follow-up studies,  industrial life tests, study of economic durations,  astronomy, demography among others. Development of suitable  statistical methods is crucial to handling of such data so that  valid scientific conclusions can be derived. This project  develops several novel approaches, some of which are suitable  for identification of health related risk factors, such as exposure to  hazardous environment, consumption of certain foods etc., and  others are applicable to evaluation of therapeutic effects as well  cost effectiveness of medical treatments. These new methods may impact  other areas of public and scientific interests, an example of which is  the study of factors influencing unemployment duration.",
