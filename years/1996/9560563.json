 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes a new airborne trace gas sensing spectroscopic technique called Counter-Propagating Phase-Sensitive Spectroscopy. Unlike present conventional spectroscopic methods which utilize molecular absorption (based on the imaginary part of the complex index of refraction), this method relies on the anomalous dispersion which is also associated with every molecular resonance line (based on the real part of the complex index of refraction) as quantified by the Kramers-Kronig relationship. The instrument will thus sense gas concentration via beam phase and fringe shifts in a uniquely ultra-stable interferometer rather than by total beam attenuation. Using this new technique, the proposed instrument theoretically provides sensitivities approaching the quantum noise limit and about 3 orders of magnitude better than presently available molecular absorption measuring instruments. The anticipated result will be that trace gases can be selectively sensed in air at the parts per trillion level. The instrument is conceptually small, robust, vibration-insensitive and thus airworthy. Any atmospheric trace gas with a molecular absorption line in the visible, near-IR or infrared can theoretically be sensed. This includes virtually every chemical compound. The sensor is theoretically capable of measuring atmospheric pollution at the parts per trillion level.       It is anticipated that Counter-Propagating Phase-Sensitive spectroscopy will yield trace-gas sensitivities 3 orders of magnitude better than traditionally used approaches. This instrument promises to be reliable, stable, tunable to a host of chemical compounds, and thus able to provide improved industrial safety monitoring, pollution monitoring, and increased sensitivity for measurements of trace gas atmospheric pollutants and chemical tracers.",
