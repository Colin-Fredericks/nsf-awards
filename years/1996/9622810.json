 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622810  Tian       The main themes on the project are I. Nonlinear Dispersive  Oscillations,     II. Hele-Shaw Flows and III. Stokes Flows. In project I, the  main     purpose is to analyze the generation and propagation of  oscillations     described by the defocusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation as  dispersion     goes to zero. Microscopically, the oscillations propagate  according to     the Whitham equations. The proposed method is a construction  of solutions     of the Whitham equations via a hodograph transform. Both  projects II     and III concern the motion of an interface between a more  viscous     fluid and a less viscous fluid to be regarded as invicid. The  viscous     fluid is governed by Darcy's law in the second project, and by  the     Stokes equations in the last one. The emphases are on the  types of     singularity formation in the presence of surface tension,  Hele-Shaw     and Stokes flows in dimension 3. The proposed methods will be  both     analytical and computational.  %%%      Nonlinear dispersive oscillations can be observed in  collisionless shocks     in plasmas and optical shocks in optical fibers. What is  fascinating     about this phenomenon is the phase transition between  different regions.     The goal is to understand the phase transition from  non-oscillatory     to oscillatory regions. Both Hele-Shaw and Stokes flows are  flows in     porous media. It is well known that the interface will be  unstable     when a less viscous fluid drives a more viscous fluid. This  instability     is responsible for water flooding of oil wells, and is of  obvious     importance to oil reservoir engineering. The aim is to  understand this     instability in detail. The principal investigator proposes to  use     some new analytical and numerical techniques to study these  problems.  ***",
