Thin films of the proposed inorganic:organic  hybrid materials will be fabricated via the laser assisted  molecular beam deposition technique. The structural, linear  and nonlinear optical characterization of these films will  be conducted. The microenvironment of the composite will be  investigated using organic fluorescent probes whose  fluorescent peak, lifetime, quantum yield and anisotropy are  highly dependent on the microenvironment. The optical  quality will be evaluated by measuring the waveguide losses.  For the investigation of the third-order nonlinear optical  properties, which can be used for all optical signal  processing in photonics, a combination of Kerr gate,  transient absorption and degenerate four-wave mixing will be  performed using femtosecond laser pulses. Also, the third-  order nonlinear optical processes will be studied in planar  optical waveguide configuration and in the Fabry-Perot  cavity mode. For second order nonlinear optical investi-  gations, necessary polar structure will be introduced in the  fabricated films via the poling process. The second-order  nonlinear optical materials will be studied using both  second harmonic generation and electro-optic modulation.  %%%  A frontier area of current material science is the  development of novel high performance mutifunctional  materials for the application of emerging state-of-the-art  technologies such as photonics, biophotonics and  optoelectronics. A novel approach is presented in this  proposal for the fabrication of thin films of a new class of  inorganic:organic hybrid materials for photonics via laser  assisted molecular beam deposition. The proposed novel  inorganic:organic hybrid materials produced by this  technique combine the high optical quality and environmental  stability of inorganics with the fast and large nonlinear  optical response of organics. The laser as sisted molecular  beam deposition approach of generating inorganic:organic  composites is highly unique in that it involves direct low  temperature seeding of an organic vapor into a molecular  beam expansion of the inorganic oxide produced by laser  ablation. Films are grown directly on a desired substrate  which is situated downstream in the path of the molecular  beam.    ***",
