 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposal is to improve basic education  in mathematics at the postsecondary level.  The underlying  philosophy is that students must be actively involved in  meaningful, global learning grounded in real life  situations.  To enact this philosophy, the project will  develop two, three credit courses in integrated  mathematics/sciences, which will meet general education  requirements in mathematics for the Associate and Bachelor's  degrees, and serve in the preparation of teachers for grades  K-12. Content will be based on critical concepts drawn from  College Algebra, College Trigonometry and Statistics.  Cooperative and discovery learning, along with the uses of  interactive multimedia, will be emphasized.  Students will  form teams across diverse educational environments, and will  conduct long-term studies of critical community problems.  Faculty will serve as mentors and coaches.  The courses will  be developed and team-taught by faculty from all of the  higher education institutions in the metropolitan  Jacksonville, Florida area, as well as two secondary schools  in the two county area. Classes will be conducted in  electronic classrooms connected via two-way audio and video.  Special emphasis will be placed on participation of women  and minorities.  Expected outcomes include over 70 faculty  and 1,400 students affected by the project.",
