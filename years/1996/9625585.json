Since this alloy can be made into  a  quasicrystal with a high quality lattice structure,  dynamical  diffraction  is  feasible.   The basic  question  still  remains,  \"Where  are  the atoms?\" and twelve years after the discovery  of  quasicrystals   this  question  has  not  been  fully   answered.  Experiments at Purdue and at the synchrotron light sources,  NSLS  and   CHESS,  will  include  quantitative  studies  of  anomalous  transmission (the Borrman effect), standing waves, and the use of  circularly   polarized   x-rays.   The   basic   issue   of   the  centrosymmetry will be examined.  An experiment will  be  carried  out  to determine the space group of the benzil molecular crystal  that  can  be  found  in  two  enantiomorphic  space  groups  and  correlate optical activity with structure.  %%%  Various  x-ray  diffraction techniques, including experiments  at  the National Synchrotron Light Source and the Cornell High Energy  Synchrotron  Source,  will  be used  to  investigate  the  atomic  arrangements in quasicrystals.  These are new materials  that  do  not  exhibit  long  range  periodicity as  do  most  other  solid  substances.   Their  high  strength,  low  density,  low  surface  friction,  and  good  oxidation resistance make  them  ideal  for  surface  coatings.  A company in France has set up  a  production  line  for using quasicrystalline coatings in frying pans  instead  of  Teflon.  Applications are envisaged for ball bearings,   Some  quasicrystals have exceptional qualities for hydrogen storage.  ***",
