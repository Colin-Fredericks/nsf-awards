 "awd_abstract_narration": "9627672  Greschler    The Computer Museum will develop two 2500 sq. ft. computer-based  exhibits the \"Virtual Fishtank: Splashing Into Complex Systems\".   One exhibit will be installed permanently in the Computer Museum  and the other will travel nationally for three to five years.   These exhibits will use computer modeling of fish to introduce the  public to new ideas about complex systems science and demonstrate  the central concept that complex behaviors and patterns can emerge  from simple interactions among simple rules.  Visitors will spend  eight to ten minutes designing their own fish at one of the ten  FishBuilder computer stations.  As they make decisions, they will  be able to observe the effects of their rule selections on a  computer display.  When satisfied with their design, visitors can  then \"tag\" their fish by placing their initials on fish tails and  launch them in the central \"fishtank\".  Large projection screens  will encircle visitors in a dramatic simulation of an underwater  aquarium environment.  Visitors will observe and analyze how the  few simple rules imbedded in the design of individual fish give  rise to complex behaviors and patterns in the entire ecosystem.   This exhibit draws on research conducted at MIT's Media Lab, The  Computer Museum, and the New England Aquarium and will be able to  reach people with a variety of learning styles.  It anticipated  completion date is March, 1998 for the TCM's version and the  traveling version will begin it's national tour in September, 1998.",
