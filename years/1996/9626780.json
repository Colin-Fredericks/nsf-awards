 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626780       Adams       Hyperbolic 3-manifold theory has had a tremendous impact on the field  of low dimensional topology.  Outstanding conjectures have fallen, one  after the other, with the application of hyperbolic techniques.  There has  been a shift in the entire approach to low dimensional topology, as  researchers now use rigid geometric arguments to prove topological  theorems.  The investigators intend to continue their research, both   individually and jointly, on the theory and computation of hyperbolic   3-manifolds.  Through a set of projects, many relying heavily on their   ability to compute examples on the computer, the researchers plan to further   the understanding of the connections between hyperbolic 3-manifolds, the   invariants that come out of hyperbolic 3-manifold theory, and the traditional   topological invariants in 3-manifold theory.       A sphere, a torus and a 2-holed torus are examples of topologically  distinct 2-dimensional surfaces.  For about 100 years mathematicians have  known that the only possible (finite) surfaces are the n-holed tori and a  corresponding family of nonorientable surfaces (e.g., the nonorientable  surface corresponding to a 1-holed torus is a Klein bottle).  In contrast,  the topological possibilities for a 3-dimensional space are vastly richer.  The beautiful relationships among the possible 3-dimensional spaces have  been greatly clarified since 1978, when William Thurston discovered that  the best way to understand the topology of the spaces was to give them  shapes of constant curvature.  The present project continues to explore the  relationships between the curvature and the topology.  Because  the shapes can be computed by hand only in a very few cases, the  project also continues to develop and support computer software for  creating the spaces and studying their properties.  This NSF funded  software is freely available, and it is used not only by mathematicians, but  also by cosmologists seeking to model the shape of the real  universe, and  by physicists modelling the behavior of various dynamical systems.  ***",
