 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this Faculty Early Career Development Program funded by the   Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, Mullin   will use transient infrared absorption spectroscopy to examine dynamical   processes of highly vibrationally excited molecules.  Interconnected   processes such as unimolecular decomposition, collisional energy   transfer, and bimolecular reactions which accompany the relaxation of the   high energy species will be investigated.  The excited molecules will be   prepared in highly excited vibrational states by ultraviolet laser   excitation, and the final quantum state distributions of the products   will be determined using high-resolution infrared lasers with fast   optical detection.  Among the molecular systems to be studied are   s-tetrazine, benzene, and azulene.  In her efforts to increase the extent   to which young women engage in scientific study, Mullin will initiate a   series of community outreach programs designed to inform and better   prepare junior and senior high school girls for college science classes   and future careers in science.  At the university level, a program of   classroom, research, and extracurricular activities will be designed to   improve the academic environment for women undergraduate and graduate   science students, and to provide increased access to senior women   mentors.  Our understanding of the chemistry and physics of numerous high-energy   environments will be enhanced from the results of Dr. Mullin's research   program.  These studies will follow the different possible paths that   energy takes as it leaves a molecule which has been highly excited   internally.  The results will lead to a deeper knowledge of the chemistry   of energetic environments in various high-energy systems, such as   plasmas, explosions, flames, combustion, and materials processing.  Dr.   Mullin's educational program is designed to provide outreach and   mentoring activities which will increase the participation of women in   scientific careers.",
