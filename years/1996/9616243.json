 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rogers  9616243    Funding is requested for partial support from the National Science Foundation for a national working symposium on the best processes for assessment in  engineering education.  The two-day symposium will focus on both the processes and tools which can be used in developing and implementing an assessment plan, appropriate use of assessment methods, and the feedback of results.  The target audience for this workshop is engineering deans, department heads, and engineering faculty.  The context for discussions will be the ABET Criteria 2000.  Each presenter will be asked to frame and develop materials for their presentations within this context as Criteria 2000 provides a common denominator for all engineering programs.    The Organizing Committee will identify persons who have had experience in the focus areas of the conference and encourage them to submit abstracts and outlines of proposed sessions.  In addition, the engineering education community will be invited to submit abstracts.  The overarching criteria for selection will be the practicality and relevance of the proposed topic to engineering education.    A final report will be submitted to NSF, ABET, and ASEE describing the model and the lessons learned from the symposium planning process and an analysis of the symposium assessment results.  A WWW page will be established to encourage networking among attendees.  The symposium abstracts will be distributed to all participants and made available on the symposium Web site.    The Symposium is scheduled to be held April 11-12, 1997 on the campus of Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.  Rose-Hulman is a recognized leader in undergraduate engineering education and has developed innovative curriculum and outstanding educational facilities.  Participants will be provided on opportunity to experience some of the new state-of-the-art flexible learning spaces and talk with faculty and students about curriculum development and projects.",
