 "awd_abstract_narration": "Students majoring in mathematics, students majoring in fields that require substantial amounts of mathematics, or students planning on teaching mathematics need the technological expertise to be successful in their careers. The objective of this project is to provide a technologically enriched environment in order to carry out activities that give students the expertise with appropriate software for understanding mathematics, solving problems, and accessing information through networks such as the world wide web. To carry out this objective we are obtaining twenty computers for student use, along with appropriate instructor equipment and printers to be included in a modern electronic classroom. This equipment will be used in each of the targeted courses, Calculus, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, and Geometry, to carry out exploratory activities and integrated projects. The appropriate use of technology is especially important in a minority institution such as Western New Mexico University. Students that have traditionally been underrepresented in mathematics and science will be given opportunities to explore mathematical ideas and problem solving in ways that allow full participation in a cooperative learning environment. The activities and projects developed in this project will be made available through presentations at national, regional, and local meetings as well as through regional workshops.",
