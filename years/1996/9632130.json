 "awd_abstract_narration": "A variety of new initiatives in computational structural  and molecular biology, along with the Human Genome Project,  have brought computation and computer-based information  systems to the forefront of medicine, genetics an  biotechnology.  However the majority of publicly accessible  computational tools are underutilized because they are  complex and difficult to access.  The mission of this  project is to create a publicly accessible, centralized,  directory for molecular biological software and data. The  project will further develop the \"Yellow Pages of Molecular  Biology Software\" server and make it available on the  Internet via the World Wide Web.  The prototype of the  system, developed with a planning grant, is accessible via  the URL http://www.bchs.uh.edu/Server.      The Bio-Access Guide to the Internet Yellow Pages, or  \"Yellow BAGI\", will let the users look for software by  operating system, keyword, author, or site. Each index is  cross-indexed to another, and one can download the selected  software (from any site indexed) by clicking on the name of  the program of interest. In the prototype we have indexed  two sites, ftp.bio.indiana.edu and ftp.bchs.uh.edu.     In this project we will collaborate with the (somewhat  similar) European Bioinformatics Institute's Biocatalog  project. We will divide areas of responsibility and share  data on a daily basis between the two projects. Our  automatic Netnews and FTP site surveys will complement their  journal screening. We will also provide a replacement for  Pedro's Biomolecular Research Tools Web pages, which have  not been updated in recent times.     The primary focus of our work will be to implement the  Yellow BAGI project and develop a trial relational schema  for the BAGI data bank. We will also incorporate lessons  from the Biocatalog project, which has different strengths  and weaknesses from this work. Using other sources of  information such as journals not covered by Biocatalog staff  scanning we will add information t o BAGI and the Biocatalog.     The final goal of this project will be to determine  scalability of the data collection mechanisms we have  developed. Most importantly, we will measure the biological  community's interest and feedback on the project, to decide  whether to proceed into a maintenance phase.",
