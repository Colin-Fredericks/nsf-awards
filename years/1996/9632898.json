In  particular, this grant supports further development and  applications of  the invaded cluster algorithm, devised  earlier by the PI.  The other two projects are: (1)  investigation of computational complexity in collaboration  with a computer science colleague and (2) a collaboration  with experimental colleagues on the flow properties of  fluids in porous media.  %%%  This grant supports work at the interface of computer  science and materials theory.  There are projects where the  computational needs are such as to require whole new  framework. The PI has successfully proposed a highly  efficient way to calculating the equilibrium  properties,  called invaded cluster method.  This grant further supports  development and applications of this work.  There is a  project to study the complexity of a computation, a subject  likely to be of considerable significance in future.  Finally there is a project to study fluid flow through the  porous media.  ***",
