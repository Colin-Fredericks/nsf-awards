 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Thomas B. Rauchfuss of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign   will design and synthesize a variety of molecular and solid-state metal   sulfide compounds.  The four specific areas of study include   metal-centered reactivity in M4S3 clusters and osmium- and iron-sulfides,   examining structure/reactivity trends in M3S4 clusters, development of   new routes to dimers and polymers containing metal clusters, and   manipulating the stability and stoichiometry of newly discoverd C60-S-Fe   adducts.  A basic premise of the cluster work is that reactive entities   are best prepared by subtle means compatible with the preservation of   highly reactive sites, and patterns delineated in this study are expected   to provide a context for correlating a significant body of molecular and   solid state chemistry.  Dr. Rauchfuss will also explore new hybrid   bio-organometallic materials and new carbon sulfides derived from C60   which bridge the interface between inorganic and organometallic sulfide   chemistry.  The overall goal of this research is a molecular-level understanding of   the synthesis, reactivity, and structure of metal sulfides.  The   information obtained from this work provides an underpinning for new   catalytic technologies, new materials, and most importantly, the   discovery of unexpected new chemical phenomena.  The work is motivated by   the broad relevance of metal sulfide systems and the chemsitry of   elemental sulfur to such materials. Furthermore, the work is expected to   lead to the discovery of new chemical phenomena related to materials used   to clean fossil fuels, to transform atmospheric nitrogen into life-giving   ammonia, and to capture and transfer energy from the sun.",
