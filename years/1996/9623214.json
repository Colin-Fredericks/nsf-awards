 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Bleher  9623214    The project is devoted to the semiclassical trace formulae for the   Schrodinger operator on compact manifolds, limiting probability   distributions of quantum energy levels, and related problems in   the theory of random matrices. Topics of investigation include:   (i) Asymptotics of the oscillatory part in the Weyl spectral   formula and periodic geodesics, statistics of eigenvalues  of the Schrodinger operator, and mathematical problems of the   theory of quantum chaos. (ii) The problem of the uniform semiclassical   quantization near unstable invariant manifolds. (iii) Universality   of the spacing distribution and double scaling limit in the matrix   model. The principal investigator has been working in this area   for several years in collaboration with Freeman Dyson and Jean   Bourgain (Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton), Joel Lebowitz   (Rutgers University), Yakov Sinai (Princeton University),  and others. Among his important contributions are the proof   of almost periodicity of the Weyl spectral error function for  integrable quantum systems, limit theorems for the distribution  of eigenvalues, the proof of the Berry saturation conjecture for the   eigenvalue statistics, and several other results.    In the project the principal investigator is going to study the   statistics of energy levels and eigenstates in quantum systems,  and the universality of the eigenvalue distribution and double scaling   limit in the matrix model. These problems are very important  for numerous applications in the theory of quantum chaos, bosonic   strings and quantum gravity, mesoscopic systems, and multivariate   statistical analysis, and the project is directed to  the applications. The tools include the methods of the theory of   integrable systems, semiclassical asymptotics, the matrix   Riemann-Hilbert problem, and other methods of modern mathematics.   The proposed study is heavily based on computer experiments.",
