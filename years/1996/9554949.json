 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing materials that enhance the  Harvard approach curriculum and that of other reform  projects for precalculus and calculus with techniques  borrowed from Sher and Wilkinson's adaptation of Treisman's  approach. The approach takes advantage of, but does not  require, computer workstations designed for group  interaction with interactive animated demonstrations of  ideas in mathematics and computer science. These group  stations, funded under the Instrumentation and Laboratory  Improvement Program, are specifically designated for use by  groups of three students.  Groups work as a team to solve  problems posed by the instructor. The group stations are  also available after class for project preparation. The  materials being developed illustrates precalculus and  calculus concepts. The project is evaluating this approach  by measuring retention rates, periodically surveying the  students to measure changes in attitudes, and measuring the  effect of laboratory courses on student grades. A variety of  conference presentations and journal publications describe  the results from our project. A laboratory manual and other  materials are being produced for commercial publication as  well as via the World Wide Web. The project principals are  conducting a week-long course for community college and high  school teachers to disseminate these ideas. Queensborough  and Borough of Manhattan Community Colleges are serving as  beta test sites.",
