 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is the development of a curriculum in cell and molecular biology with a laboratory focusing on the population genetic analysis of threatened and endangered species. This can be an integral part of the Biology major. It fits into the curriculum well because the research problems being addressed combine molecular techniques with an application that has intrinsic relevance to students with a strong interest in organismal biology.    The plan is to accomplish this objective through the distribution of basic concepts and techniques among several courses at the introductory (100 and 200) level followed by the application of these techniques in upper-level (300) courses. The focus of the laboratory work in the upper-level courses is on the development and usage of microsatellite genetic markers designed specifically for population genetic analysis of a particular threatened or endangered species.   As a result of this program, students are gaining experience with molecular techniques such as DNA isolation, restriction analysis, Southern blotting, cloning, library construction and screening, DNA sequencing, and polymerase chain reactions. Audiences targeted by this program include women, who comprise 75 percent of our student population, prospective teachers (about 35 per year), and biology majors. The impact on curricular development can be analyzed by surveys and course evaluations. It is further expected that the laboratory activities developed in this program will be published in journals and in laboratory manuals.",
