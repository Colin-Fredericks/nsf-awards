Kyle Vanderlick University of Pennsylvania   The focus of this proposal is to elucidate how surface chemistry and topography control the interactions between solids as they are into an out of  molecular contact.  The primary tool of our investigations is the surface forces apparatus, a device designed to measure the forces acting between two opposed surfaces as their separation is varied.  Recently, we extended the capabilities of the surface forces apparatus to new level with the development of Extended Spectral Analysis Multiple Beam Inteferometry (ESA-MBI).  This optical technique, which is used to determine surface separation, allow metals to be used as substrates in the surface force apparatus. In addition to breaking open the application of the surface forces apparatus to this important class of material, ESA-MBI boasts another advantage:  the technique provides information on the degree and form of surface roughness, in-situ, under states of stress that result when one surface is in contact with, or near to another.  We propose to take advantage the fundamental interac tions occurring across rough interfaces.  Such interfaces will be formed upon bringing two surfaces-one or both of them rough-into and out of molecular contact.  A particular focus of this research will be to study the contact, deformations, and adhesion between surfaces with different chemical and mechanical properties.  Our studies will take advantage of self-assembled monolayer formation as a vehicle for surface modification.                         ;                                                           Oh     +'  0                     S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   '                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               $       H       l                                               D       h                                                   R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       Derrick Myers                       Derrick Myers               @      ?                            @      ?                            @      ?                                                                                                    @                                           Microsoft Word 6.0                                                      2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      e =       e                   ;                                                           j       j   j       j       j       j                                                                                   1                                                                                               &                   j           T       .                           j                                                                                         j       j                                                                       j               j                                       j       r       j       j       j       j                                                                                                                             ABSTRACT CTS-9423780 T.
