Hunter, Beverly  University of Illinois    CISE/EHR/ENG/MPS Collaborative Research on Learning Technologies Program:  National Center for Collaborative Research    The University of Illinois, has been awarded $50,000 for a 12 month period to develop the rationale and plan for establishing a virtual National Center for Collaborative Research (NCCR) on Learning Technologies.  The proposed NCCR will perform multi-disciplinary research and development in learning technologies.  The activities of the proposed center will be directed toward developing and evaluating web-based learning technologies for application domains in which the community of learners is relatively heterogeneous.  These application domains include learning in K-12 and College environments, learning for industrial competitiveness, and learning  for health care and social services.    Partners in this planning grant include BBN, University of Arizona, Southern Illinois University, and the University of Southern California.",
