The goals of the project are:    o to provide background information on the theories and techniques of human genetic science,  o to raise the social, ethical, and legal issues and concerns associated with human genetic research, and  o to provide an opportunity for the public to interact with the scientific experts and policy makers.    The specific programs include:    o DNA and Behavior:  Is Our Fate in Our Genes?  o Prenatal Genetic Testing:  Better Babies Through Science?  o Gene Testing;  Do You Really Want to Know Your Future?  o Gene Therapy:  Medicine For Your Genes.  o DNA and the Law  o The Commercialization of Genetic Information  o Eugenics, Past and Present  o Race, Evolution, and Philosophy in the Age of Genetics  o The Human Genome Project:  Roadmap to the Human Body    The radio programs will be supplemented by a variety of printed and electronic ancillary materials exploring the science, ethics, and social impact of human genetic research.    The project will be under the Bari Scott who will serve as PI.  She has most recently been Executive Producer for The Telecommunication Radio Project.  The Co-PI's will be Mat Binder, an Independent radio producer and instructor at the University of California, and Jude Thilman, the Project Director/Host of The communications Revolution, the nationally syndicated, live series on new telecommunications technologies.  The principal consultants responsible for the science content of the project will be Sylvia Spengler, Deputy Director of The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Human Genome Center and Lane Conn, Coordinator of the Human Genome Education program at the Stanford University Human Genome Center.  The science consultants and production staff will work closely with approximately thirty genome scientists nationwide who have formally agreed to advise the projec t.",
