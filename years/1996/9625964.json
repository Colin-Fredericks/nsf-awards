 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625964  Richardson  This award provides support for the acquisition of equipment to  develop a processing and characterization facility for photo-  thermo-refractive glass (PTRG) materials.  This facility is  critical to the continued progress in the fabrication of new  optical recording media for high efficiency volume holographic  optical element applications based on glass-ceramic materials.  Experimental results obtained at CREOL (Center for Research and  Education in Optics and Lasers) during the past 18 months have  confirmed for the first time in this country, the potential of an  important new technology for recording and storing information  through the selective nucleation and crystallization of photo-  induced phases in a robust glass matrix.  This glass material,  however has to date been obtainable only in Russia.  As a result  of our experiments, the limitations of the Russian material and  the importance of processing these materials within our  laboratory, has been firmly realized.  Establishment of this  facility at CREOL will utilize our institute's strengths in both  the design and characterization of photorefractive materials and  our unique capabilities in the melting and characterization of  new glasses for optical applications.  CREOL contains one of the  few academic research groups in the country specifically  engineering and melting new glass compositions for optical  applications.  This award will enable the establishment of bulk  glass processing capabilities and construction of an improved,  reliable and accurate holographic element formation and  characterization facility.  The equipment includes furnace and  optical finishing facilities to allow in-house melting and  fabrication of glass starting materials, and an ultraviolet (UV)  laser system which can efficiently irradiate the glass, forming  the hologram, and subsequently characterize the quality of the  resulting element.  Once operational, irradiation/crystallization  studies on in-house produced glass compo sitions, with  accompanying analysis of material physical properties  thermal,  mechanical and optical  will continue to be carried out.  %%%  Establishment of this Processing and Characterization facility  will assist in the educational goals of our program at CREOL/UCF.  CREOL has been instrumental in establishing Master's and Doctoral  degree programs in Optical Sciences and Engineering at UCF.  Over  twenty courses in optics are taught by twenty five nationally-  recognized CREOL faculty.  The co-PI's oversee research programs  containing a total of 5 students working on various,  interdisciplinary topics related to optics.  Currently, 2  undergraduate and 2 graduate students utilize limited (nonoxide)  glass melting facilities.  Acquisition of melting and fabrication  equipment identified in this program will allow expansion of lab-  based training in traditional glass processing at both graduate  and undergraduate levels.  A CREOL-funded Ph.D. student will be  associated with the glass processing and optical characterization  of the PTRG materials.  ***",
