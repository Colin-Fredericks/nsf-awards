 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposal describes the next generation of security cameras. These cameras will provide two improvements over current technology. First, the `Smart Camera` will provide much higher resolution images of person's in its field of view than is possible with today's security cameras. With today's security cameras, a suspect's image captured by a security camera could easily have only a small number of pixels actually focused on the person. This may not be enough for identification or for irrefutable evidence in court. The `Smart Camera` will capture a much higher resolution image. Based on initial computations, for typical situations, thousands of fixed cameras with telephoto lenses would be required to reliably capture the same resolution image of a suspect as would be captured by a single `Smart Camera.`  The second improvement over current security cameras is that this type of camera captures images with high precision 3 dimensional information. If the camera were mounted two meters from a person as the person entered a bank, Government building, etc., the face data, including depth information across every feature of the face, would be captured with an accuracy of approximately .4 mm.  Accurately measured three dimensional images of a person's face may prove to be nearly as unique as a fingerprint. `Faceprints` could be captured visibly as a subject walks into a building or even walks along a street. Since 3 dimensional images contain literally an entirely new dimension of data, images should be able to be compared more quickly and reliably. Images of people entering major facilities such as train or bus stations could be automatically matched in real-time against most wanted lists, or suspects in recent crimes.       The bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City has focused attention on the need for increased security. Potential criminals should be significantly deterred by better security cameras, and by automatic means to identify and apprehend criminals. For those that are not deterred, the system will provide a next generation of tools for identification and apprehension.",
