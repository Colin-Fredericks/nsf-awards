The study takes advantage of a unique opportunity to test theory on the evolution of behavioral differences between the sexes.  Research will be carried out on Syngnathus typhle, the broad-nosed pipefish.  Male pipefishes and seahorses carry developing young on their bodies, often in a fully enclosed pouch, and provide nutrients, aeration and protection for the developing young.  This male \"pregnancy\" results in a reversal of the usual sex roles, wherein  females compete for access to mates and males tend to be choosier. By using DNA fingerprinting techniques, field experiments will determine how often males in natural environments receive eggs from multiple females and will test whether females in nature mate with multiple males.  These findings will place behavioral experiments performed in the laboratory into a broader evolutionary context.  Second, breeding experiments in the laboratory will test whether population sex ratio influences competition among females for mates. Third, manipulations will be conducted to test for  competition among eggs from different mothers when carried by the same male.  Findings from this research will advance the understanding of the evolution of behavior and provide important information for fisheries biologists working to conserve biodiversity in this enigmatic and diverse group of fishes.",
