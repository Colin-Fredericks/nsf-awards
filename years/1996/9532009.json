 "awd_abstract_narration": "9532009  JONES         Oregon State University (OSU) will operate the R/V WECOMA  during 1996 as a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-  sponsored projects.  The R/V WECOMA is a 185' general research  vessel constructed in 1975 and owned by the National Science  Foundation.  The vessel underwent a mid-life refit and general  upgrade in 1994.  OSU operates the WECOMA under a charter agreement  with NSF.  The ship is scheduled for 180 operating days in 1996, of  which 104 days are in support of NSF-sponsored programs.  The  remaining 76 days are in support of Navy programs.  The cruises  will be mainly in the north pacific off the US west coast.         This vessel is part of a fleet used by NSF to support  oceanographic research.  Most oceanographic research requires  highly specialized equipment that must be permanently installed on  a ship for which the ship must be specifically designed.  This  equipment also requires highly trained crew members for maintenance  and operation.  These vessels do not operate in the same manner as  general cargo or fishing vessels, therefore, NSF supports the  operation of a variety of vessels specifically dedicated to  oceanographic research that are operated by universities and  research institutions around the country.",
