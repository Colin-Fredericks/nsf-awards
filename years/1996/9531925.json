It  represents an attempt to generalize and to place into perspective the  somewhat limited spatial gradient theories of local interaction. The  investigation is theoretical and is based on the idea of energy minimization.  While the generic problems contained in this work are nonconvex, and must  address this level of difficulty, to a large extent the interests and  objectives lie in understanding the \"penalty\" due to the global nonlocal  structure. The project involves an investigation of the regularity and  existence of minimizers.  It includes a proposal to describe their detailed  form, and a plan to understand how the number of transition boundaries that a  body can coincidentally support relates to the degree of nonlocal influence  and to the size of the body. The identification of length scales and the  application of scaling transformations are suggested as avenues for  understanding the way in which gradient theories may be considered as  approximations. The overall project is expected to lead to a model for  understanding the organization of material phase structures in bodies at  finite scales. The detailed investigations are expected to form a bridge in  the \"regularity gap\" that now exists between the purely local, strongly  irregular, theories commonly associated with the classical ideas of Gibbs,  and the relatively smooth gradient theories historically attributed to van  der Waals, Korteweg, Ginzburg and Landau, and Cahn and Hilliard.   %%%  Understanding the behavior of materials which can change their internal  structure when loaded, heated, or placed in chemical or electrical  environments, is important to the development of advanced applications in  materials science---applications which impact many diverse areas of society,  from energy conservati on to micromachines for medical devices.  The idea that  nondestructive, reversible phase changes can be used to obtain a desired  sensible material behavior is of great potential technological importance,  and understanding how to affect and control such processes is an essential  step in the transfer of this science into technology for the benefit of  society.  Electrorheological fluids sense a small scale structure and stiffen  and become solid-like in the presence of an electric field, and the design of  micro-switches in the area of thin film technologies also depends upon a  similar small scale phenomenon. There is a need to improve our understanding  and predictive capabilities of such materials through the development of  relevant mathematical models. The existence of microscopic domains in  ferromagnetic and ferroelastic materials, shear bands in ductile solids,  finely twinned microstructural laminates in martensite (shape memory alloys,  etc...), and recently discovered high transition temperature superconductors  all underscore the importance of internal, small scale structures.  Experimental observations have provided a wealth of evidence that relates the  gross response of a material body to its underlying microstructure. This  research program investigates the role that long range particle-particle  interactions play in the development of microstructure. It is based on the  global optimization of energy and the idea that the amount of energy that is  stored in each element of a body is influenced by not only the state of the  element, but also by the state of the other elements of the body, in a way  similar to what molecular theory might suggest. The theory is  phenomenological and, as such, is contained within the framework of nonlinear  continuum mechanics. The aim is to determine the significance of nonlocal  theory in describing the behavior of materials which support coexistent phase  structures---materials which depend upon the existence of these  microstructures for their  novel responses.   ***",
