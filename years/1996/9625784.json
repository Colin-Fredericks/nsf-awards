 "awd_abstract_narration": "Static scheduling utilizes the knowledge of problem  characteristics to reach a global optimal, or near optimal,  solution.  Although these scheduling algorithms apply to  parallel programs, the algorithms themselves are sequential,  and are executed on a single processor system.  The memory  and speed of a single processor limits the size of the graph  that can be handled.  Using multiprocessors to schedule  tasks to multiprocessors is a natural solution to solve  these problems. In fact, a scalable scheduler is not  feasible without parallelizing the scheduling algorithm and  running it on a parallel computer.    There are two major data domains in a scheduling algorithm,  the source domain and the target domain.  The source domain  is the macro-dataflow graph; the target domain is the  schedule for target processors.  Two approaches are  proposed, the vertical scheme and the horizontal scheme.  The advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches will  be studied.  This research has already accomplished the  primary stage.  Two parallel scheduling algorithms have been  developed, vertical parallel MCP (VPMCP) and horizontal  parallel MCP (HPMCP).  New parallel scheduling algorithms  will be developed.  An incremental parallel scheduling is  also proposed for applications with dynamic and  unpredictable features.  The goal of this project is to  investigate this approach and evaluate its performance for  some important applications, and to integrate  these results  into a tool-set that will provide support for scheduling of  dynamic and irregular problems.  ***",
