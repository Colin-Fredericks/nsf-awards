 "awd_abstract_narration": "9602252  This award renews support for a Research Training Group in  Linking Levels of Ecological Organization at the Kellogg  Biological Station of Michigan State University.  During the  period of the award, NSF support will be gradually phased  out as other sources of funding are identified.  The faculty  group currently has 8 members drawn from 5 departments.  The  funds awarded will provide stipends for graduate students,  for trainee travel to other institutions for specialized  training not available at Michigan State, and to bring  investigators from other research and academic institutions  to the Kellogg Station for seminars and workshops.  During  the initial 5 years of  funding, a number of new courses in  both basic and applied aspects of ecology.  Several of these  have now become a standard element of graduate training in  ecology and evolution at the University.  In addition to the  funds provided by this award, institutional and other  resources  help extend the program to include the  participation of elementary and high school students, and a  separate NSF award for an REU-site activity supports the  participation of undergraduate students during the summer.  The need to train scientists who can attack research  problems across levels of ecological organization is  significant and growing.  The problems of global change and  of maintenance of biological diversity combine to make such  training increasingly important.  This program will provide  such training, taking advantage of the techniques and  concepts of researchers who address a variety of  evolutionary and ecological problems at the level of genes,  individual organisms, populations, communities, ecosystems  or entire landscapes.",
