 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    The collaborative project investigates the demographic mechanisms  responsible for dramatic growth in existing Adelie Penguins  Pygoscelis adeliae colonies, and the founding of new ones, in the  Ross Sea. Research will also investigate the possibility that  growth is related to documented climate change in the region by:  1) distinguishing the relative importance of the key resources  that constrain growth of colonies--availability of nesting  habitat vs. access to food -- and 2) examining behavioral  mechanisms (philopatry -- the immigration/emigration balance,  and/or breeding effort/success) that influence colony growth as a  function of initial size and distribution. This will be the first  empirical a piori study to consider the geographic structuring of  a seabird population.  Results will increase understanding of 1)  population regulation and patterns of dispersion, and 2) effects  of climate change, mediated through changes in sea-ice cover, on  penguin populations.  In addition, results will provide a context  in which to interpret conflicting data on penguin population  trends from existing programs that use Adelie penguins as an  indicator species for point source anthropogenic impacts on  Antarctic resources (e.g., fishery catches, disturbance by  tourism).    The 7 years of research (4 full and 1 partial years funded by  NSF) includes intensive field study conducted at three Ross  Island penguin colonies. The study will quantify reproductive  effort and success, food availability (access to food), diet  quality, habitat use and immigration/emigration relative to  colony size and environmental conditions (i.e., pack-ice cover).  Methods will bring together several well-established techniques  that have been successfully but infrequently used in Antarctic  biological research:  aerial photography to evaluate availability  of nesting habitat, microwave images of sea-ice concentration to  assess availability of feeding habitat, analysis of stable  isotopes to evaluate food  quality, radio telemetry to assess  overlap in colony feeding areas, and automatic systems to log  aspects of reproductive effort.  The research builds on, and  collaborates with the efforts of Landcare Research New Zealand  (LCRNZ), which will have conducted two preliminary field seasons,  including testing of new equipment, will continue through the  period of effort, and which is independently funded.  Researchers  from the University of California Santa Cruz, University of  Wisconsin, and Avid Inc will collaborate with those from H.T.  Harvey & Associates and LCRNZ to accomplish project goals.",
