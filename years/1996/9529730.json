 "awd_abstract_narration": "9529730  MORSE    The goal of the research is to determine whether molecular  signals and mechanisms similar to those that control larval  settlement, metamorphosis and recruitment of the Agariciid corals  also regulate these centrally important processes in Acropora  palmata, one of the most ecologically important, abundant and  rapidly growing major reef-building corals of the Caribbean.  This question is of major ecological significance because A.  palmata is representative of the most specious genus of corals on  Earth, and is representative of the ecologically dominant corals  that reproduce by synchronous mass spawning to yield larvae that  lack endosymbiotic algae (zooxanthellae).  The corals in which  signal-dependent induction of larval settlement and recruitment  previously had been demonstrated (the Agariciid corals) reproduce  by brooding and release of mature larvae that already contain  endosymbiotic zooxanthellae, and these corals often play  relatively minor ecological roles in the natural environment.  Following up on recent research leads, the specific objectives of  the proposed renewal are to test the following specific  hypotheses: (1) That specific crustose coralline algae are  required to induce larval settlement and metamorphosis of the  mass-spawning A. palmata; (2) That chemosensory recognition  mediates larval responsiveness to any such required substratum;  (3) That the molecular inducer of settlement and metamorphosis  recognized by A. palmata larvae is an algal (or microbial) cell-  wall compound identical or closely similar to that which controls  larval settlement, metamorphosis and recruitment of the sympatric  Agariciids; (4) That larval recognition of this inducer molecule  (purified and immobilized on a \"larval flypaper\") can be shown to  be responsible, in part, for substratum-specific settlement,  metamorphosis and recruitment of A. palmata in the natural  environment; and (5) That species-specific differences in larval  orientation at settlement reduce the  potential for competition  between Acropora palmata and Agaricia humilis.    ***",
