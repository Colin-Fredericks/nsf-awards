The initial goals of the Center for Health Management Research were:  1) to develop a research agenda in collaboration with corporate members; 2) to undertake research, development, and evaluation projects on behalf of the corporate members; 3)to disseminate to the members findings of health services research; 4) to identify and disseminate to the members successful innovations and management practices from other health care organizations; and 5) to identify and disseminate to the members relevant research findings successful innovations and management practices from other industries and countries.    The vision of the Center continues to be refined in order to support its corporate members as they seek to adapt to a complex, challenging, and turbulent environment.    This award provides funding to expand the Center for Health Management Research.  Continuing discussion with NSF, researchers from Northwestern University, and a number of noteworthy health care organizations has led to a decision to join the Northwestern-based group to the Center for Health Management  and become an affiliated research site, governed by a single Industry Advisory Board.      The resultant Center for Health Management Research would substantially increase its complement of corporate members and its attendant financial support base.  The influence of the research would likely be enhanced through this larger base, our academic colleagues gain access to a larger set of high-quality organizations, and corporate members have a larger set of colleagues with whom to share experiences and learnings.",
