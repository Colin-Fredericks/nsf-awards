 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  proposal  is  a  request  for  partial  funding  of  a  DNA  sequencing and DNA informatics facility. The funds requested from  NSF  will be used to provide computers for this facility and  for  associated  research in DNA informatics. Funds have already  been  obtained  to purchase two automated sequencers. This facility  is  intended to become a nucleus for research and teaching of Genomic  Sciences on the NCSU campus.    Significance  of  the  proposed activity to  the  advancement  of  knowledge  and  education:  New advances  in  the  automation  of  sequencing technology have created a new paradigm for research on  organisms of long term scientific or commercial interest. In this  new  paradigm,  DNA  sequence is the primary basis  for  defining  function  of  the  expressed genes in a tissue, organ  or  entire  organism.  It is now necessary and feasible to obtain far  larger  amounts  of  sequence information to address a  wide  variety  of  important  biological problems. These areas include:  development  and physiology of experimental organisms, the genetic engineering  of agricultural plants and animals, and the fundamental issues of  population biology, systematics and biodiversity that are  needed  to   understand  the  mechanisms  of  biological  adaptation  and  evolution.  A  major  barrier  to the  application  of  this  new  paradigm in all areas of basic and applied biology is the lack of  adequate computational and statistical tools for the analysis  of  DNA   sequences.   Methodology  for  DNA   sequence   information  acquisition   and   analysis  is  important  for   our   nation's  intellectual resource base, our research capability, and for long  term industrial development.    Statement of Objectives: High throughput sequencing, and advanced  computational  analysis  of  sequence information  are  essential  technologies  for  NCSU  to advance our position  as  leaders  in  Biotechnology  of Agriculture and Forestry. The purpose  of  this  proposal  is to create  a facility for DNA sequencing and sequence  analysis  through the cooperation of the College  of  Agriculture  and Life Sciences, the College of Veterinary Medicine, College of  Physical  &  Mathematical  Science, and  the  College  of  Forest  Resources.  This  facility will provide \"state of  the  art\"  DNA  sequence  and gene mapping, and computational technology  at  low  cost  to  NCSU  faculty  and the larger research  community.  One  project  to  be  carried out at the facility is  the  \"Pine  Gene  Discovery Project\" that will identify all of the expressed  genes  of  pine,  a  project  of great importance  for  systematics  and  biodiversity  and  also  for  the  wood  products  industry.   In  addition,  the  facility  will  serve  an  educational  role   by  introducing  automated sequencing and DNA  informatics  into  the  curriculum.    Research  and  Academic Infrastructure: NCSU has a long  standing  reputation  for  excellence in statistical  analysis  of  genetic  information,  population  genetics,  quantitative  genetics,  and  plant  molecular  biology. In addition to the immediate  need  to  fund  computational  capability for the DNA sequencing  facility,  our  most  advanced  research programs in  the  analysis  of  DNA  sequence information are already nearing the limitations  of  the  existing  computational equipment. The establishment of a  strong  informatics component with a DNA sequencing facility, integrating  existing  programs of quantitative and molecular genetics  should  lead to important new information and technology.    This  is a joint proposal by 47 investigators from 20 Departments  and  five Colleges of NCSU. These investigators represent a broad  spectrum of scientific knowledge, skills and experience  and  who  all  share  a  need  for a local high-throughput  DNA  sequencing  facility  with  advanced computational capability.  $184,000  has  been  awarded  by the North Carolina Biotechnology Center  toward  the  establishment of this facility. The U niversity  has  made  a  commitment  for  space,  salary for a Lab  Manager,  and  support  facilities  to  maintain  the  sequencing  center.  $162,622   is  requested  from NSF for computing equipment. The  total  cost  to  establish  the  facility  in year 1  is  $621,  211.  The  amount  requested from NSF is 26% of the total cost.",
