 "awd_abstract_narration": "For a number of years, The University of Mississippi  Biological Field Station (UMBFS) has been a research site  for the study of toxicology and human impacts on aquatic  organisms and ecosystems. This Field Station is a site  where scientists from the University and other  institutions representing many disciplines, including  biology, geology, engineering, toxicology, and  pharmacology, can participate in interdisciplinary basic  ecological research, as well as applied research that will  affect human health, the environment, and agriculture.  Due to recent administrative changes, UMBFS  is now poised  to broaden its scope of ecological research and its  educational mission.     UMBFS is located in northern Mississippi approximately 18  kilometers northeast of the Oxford campus. Acquired by The  University of Mississippi in 1985, UMBFS includes an area  of approximately 296 hectares, and encompasses pine and  mixed hardwood forest, bottomland forest, open fields,  springs, ponds, and mesocosms offer unique opportunities  for experimental research on aquatic ecosystems.    A comprehensive programmatic educational educational and  research plan developed to best utilize the UMBFS to reach  the broadest constituency possible.  The UMBFS is a multi-  faceted facility  that will, when fully developed, provide  the infrastructure for educational and research activities  concerned with terrestrial, aquatic, and wetlands ecology.  Current research projects focus on impacts to the  environment from interactions of agrichemicals,  toxicological investigations, fish genetics and behavior,  avian and herpetological population dynamics, and studies  of agricultural water use and conservation.  Recently,  UMBFS's mission has been broadened to provide enhanced  opportunities for both research and education in aquatic  and environmental sciences.  To further this mission, this  project will help support planning and program  development.",
