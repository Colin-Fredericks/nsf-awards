 "awd_abstract_narration": "Basri, Gibor  95-28272    T Tauri stars are solar-type stars at the beginning of their  lives.  Studying them involves studies of star formation, stellar  activity, accretion disks and strong bipolar outflows. One of the  richest sources of information on these objects are their  emission line profiles, though they are poorly understood because  the line formation region is complex and quite time-variable on  scales of minutes to years.  Dr. Basri plans to characterize the  time-variable behavior of the spectral lines using numerous  spectral observations of bright T Tauri star systems.  In  addition he will undertake an extensive program to model the line  emission region within the star.  His research also involves a  study of the first close low mass binary system forming within a  disk, while  searching for similar systems.  The last part of his research  program is to attempt to obtain velocities for some of the T  Tauri binaries.  Along with orbits from speckle interferometry,  this would allow a direct measurement of the masses of both stars  in the system, a major step in the calibration of pre-main  sequence evolutionary tracks.  ***",
