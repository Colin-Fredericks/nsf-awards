The objective of the  proposed  project is to characterize the profile of energy  expenditure for breeding in the degu, a rodent belonging to  a South American group, the Caviomorpha.  This group  undertakes a lengthy gestation leading to birth of highly  precocial young requiring only a brief period of suckling.  The study will seek to identify the peak demand and  expenditure of energy and to see how these correspond  to  the maximal performance capacities of the selected species.  Stable isotope technology will be used to measure rates of  energy expenditure.  An initial assessment will be made of  the link between energetics and the mode of life history  that has evolved in caviomorph rodents.     Life history theory has produced the idea that for  iteroparous animals an increase in current reproductive  output should have a negative impact on future reproductive  potential and survival.  Evidence from genetic correlations  and individual variation in performance continues to lend  support to the possibility that energy relations are indeed  a link between organismal performance and fitness.  This  study will address the role of energy in shaping life  histories by providing insights into the process of energy  use in a natural mammalian population and its relation to  maximum energetic capacities of females during gestation or  lactation.  This will include the mammalian maternal  strategy of producing precocial young.    ***",
