 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the   Chemistry Division, Bevan and Lucchese perform an experimental and   theoretical study of hydrogen-bonded and related proton-donor-proton   acceptor dimer moleculess.  Vibrational- and rotational-state-resolved   infrared spectroscopy will be combined with theoretical modeling to   investigate the nature of the interactions including geometries displaced   from those occupied by the ground state.  Complexes of homologous series   of hydrogen halides and isoelectronic proton donors will be examined to   gain a quantitative understanding of the hydrogen bond and related   interactions in systems spanning Group VII elements.  Two absorption   spectrometers, one an FTIR instrument and the other an infrared diode   laser spectrometer, both with supersonic slit-jet sample sources, will be   used to study small (HX)n clusters and rare-gas-HX dimers.  The range of   applicability of the Buckingham-Fowler (B-F)   electrostatic-plus-hard-sphere interaction model will be considered.  Hydrogen bonds are not really chemical bonds such as exist in molecules,   but rather they are weaker attractions between the hydrogen atoms of one   molecule and other atoms in a neighboring, or even in the same, molecule.    These interactions strongly affect such phenomena as the boiling point   of water, the melting point of ice, and the structure of strands of DNA   and have an impact in such wide-ranging disciplines as biochemistry,   chemistry, genetics, and advanced materials technology.  The results from   these studies will help us understand better the nature of hydrogen   bonds.",
