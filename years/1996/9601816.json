 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are developing a collaborative research and education group in  plant  ecophysiology  ecology. and  evolutionary  genetics.  This  interdisciplinary  group is composed of six scientists.  five  of  which have ;assumed their positions since January 1993. Our group  is  interested  in  the  genetic variation  of  ecophysiological,  phenological  and  morphological  traits  and  how  these  affect  population  dynamics  and ultimately, community  structure.  This  interdisciplinary  group is focussing on questions  essential  to  understanding  the  evolutionary  and  physiological  causes  and  consequences  of  patterns in plant ecology.  Due  to  the  rapid  increase  of  our  research activities  in  plant  ecophysiology,  ecology  and  evolutionary genetics, we have an urgent  need  for  plant growth facilities and analytical equipment. We are strongly  committed  to developing a collaborative group with national  and  international   recognition  extending  beyond   the   individual  members.  With  well  equipped facilities  we  can  significantly  increase  collaborative  efforts and research  productivity.  and  continue to recruit qualified graduate students and post-docs  in  our  program.  With  adequate infrastructure,  our  complementary  fields   of  expertise  will  lead  to  many  additional   future  collaborations.  Specifically  we are  requesting  three  walk-in  growth chambers, a dry combustion C,N,S analyzer, a scintillation  counter and a plate reader. A steering committee composed by  the  six  principal investigators will determine growth chamber  space  partitioning and day-to-day use of analytical equipment. Specific  training  to graduate and undergraduate students will be  offered  by  means  of  intensive workshops developed by  members  of  the  steering committee.",
