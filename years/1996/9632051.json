The goal of this project is to shed light on skills  assessment by bringing together business organizations,  government entities, university and test-development  organizations to share their experiences.  The forum will be  a two day program in April 1996, implementing one of the  major recommendations made by the participants of Industry  2000 Workshop, which was funded by NSF and other  institutions.  The results of Industry 2000, documented in a  report and video,   have defined the involvement of the IEEE  in lifelong education and influence its constituents in  industry and higher education.    The participants of the proposed Best Practices Forum will  grapple with practical issues based on the experience of  fellow participants and their organizations. The forum will  focus on reviewing existing projects and on identifying a  meaningful, practical way to assess engineering skills.  By  focusing on skills assessment practices in industry, the  forum will serve as a resource for those charged with  planning and developing relevant undergraduate and graduate  curricula as well as industry-related research,  In addition  to providing a forum where ideas and resources can be  shared, Best Practices Forum will provide IEEE with an  opportunity to learn about industry needs first hand.",
