 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the Ph.D. research of a cultural anthropologist from Yale University, studying Khmer refugee communities in New England.  The student will compare three Cambodian refugee communities in Lowell and Fall River, MA, and Providence RI.  The   focus of the study is to understand how Khmer refugees deal with their economic, social   and cultural problems by using ethnically-based resources.  Through in-depth ethnographic participant observation, semi-structured interviews with a sample of about 100 individuals,   and a survey of about 100 individuals in each site, the student will study how transnational connections lead to resources useful to the refugees, and how their self-identity as Khmer   assists and obstructs their access to valuable resources in their adopted US homeland.  This research is important because it will lead to advances in our understanding of how   refugee communities use their existing ties with their homeland and their self-defined and   other-defined identities as ethnic populations to adjust to their immigrant situations.  This   sort of understanding is increasingly more important as migration grows in volume and as   the conception of a `melting pot` where ethnic differences are blended into a new   homogenous US identity give way to an ideal of a democratic civil society composed of mutually cooperating distinctive groups.",
