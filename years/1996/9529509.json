The Johns Hopkins University   Baltimore, Maryland      Instrumentation for Computer Science and Engineering Research in Image Segmentation, Registration,   Modeling, and  Interactive Model-based Task Optimization      A computation server and visualization workstation are provided for a new laboratory in Computer Science   Department at The Johns Hopkins University for interdisciplinary research in robotics, image-processing,   computer vision, modeling, and computer-integrated surgery.  Specific research projects include: (a)   segmentation, modeling, and characterization of complex tubular structures such as blood vessels and   bronchial trees from 3D tomographic images; (b) accurate vision-based camera-to-model registration and   navigation within modeled 3D structures; and (c) development of methods for combining numerical   optimization, geometric modeling, path planning and uncertainty analysis, and interactive visualizations to   help a human expert plan a complex 3D task for robotically-assisted execution.  This research combines   numerically intensive computation on 2D and 3D images and models with interactive visualization of   models and intermediate computational results, using examples from biomedical modeling, using problems   in biomedical imaging, endoscopy, and radiation therapy planning to provide motivation and focus.  The   provided equipment significantly promotes this research by permitting realistic experimental evaluation on   full-scale image data sets and models of novel algorithms and methods in computer vision, modeling,   computational steering, and human-machine partnerships.",
