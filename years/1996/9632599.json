 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632599   Davidovits,   This project is a laboratory investigation of heterogeneous reactions important to the chemistry of the atmosphere. In collaboration with Aerodyne Research, Inc., the investigators have developed two techniques for studying gas uptake processes and measuring mass accommodation coefficients of trace atmospheric species on water and other liquids. In the first method, suitable for measuring relatively large gas uptakes, the gas phase species interacts with a controllable stream of small monodispersed droplets of known size, temperature, and chemical composition. In the second method, used to study gases with relatively  smaller uptakes, the trace gas is contained in controlled bubbles entrained in a flow of the liquid of interest.   In this project, gas uptake and co-deposition studies for nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, nitrate radical, dinitrogen pentoxide, nitric acid, nitrous acid, ammonia, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and hydroxyl radical will be carried out as a function of temperature with aqueous solutions, sulfuric acid and nitrosyl sulfuric acid solutions. The effect of photochemistry, surface charge, and atmospherically relevant additives will be examined. These data will eventually lead to a general, predictive understanding of chemistry at the gas-liquid interface.  ***",
