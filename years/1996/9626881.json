 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this meeting is to stimulate interest in and  enhance understanding of the technical aspects of computer  algebra, by providing a way for those in the region who are  active or interested in becoming more active in computer algebra  to meet with each other in an inexpensive and easily accessible  way.  This meeting will be more informal than the annual ISSAC  meetings, with ample time for unstructured interaction.  Participation by the region's graduate students will be  particularly encouraged through special invitation to  contribute to the poster sessions, and through travel support.    This meeting is well on its way to becoming a regular series for  the region, with different academic and industrial institutions  hosting the meeting in rotation.  This year's meeting is the  third in the series: the first meeting was held in 1994 at Drexel  University in Philadelphia, and the second meeting in April 1995  at the University of Delaware.  Both meetings were very  successful, and at the business session conducted at the end of  the Delaware meeting it was agreed to meet at IBM Research in  1996, the first industrial site of our series.    The meetings have had the endorsement (without financial support)  of ACM's Special Interest Group for Symbolic and Algebraic  Manipulation (SIGSAM) and of the Society for Industrial and  Applied Mathematics (SIAM).  ***",
