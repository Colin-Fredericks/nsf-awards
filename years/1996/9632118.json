 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632118  Xu       Underground pipe-type cables in power transmission systems are  widely used in urban areas.  To protect such systems, it is  necessary for the utilities to be able to accurately calculate  fault currents in the system.  An accurate calculation of fault  currents requires precise knowledge of the impedance of the  underground cables.  The objective of the proposed research project  is to develop an improved method for computing zero-sequence  impedance of underground pipe-type cables.  The pipe of the cable  is grounded at both ends and the phase currents may be unbalanced.   Since the pipe is normally made of steel which is a nonlinear  magnetic material, special attention will be paid to its nonlinear  B-H characteristic and an iterative procedure will be employed to  determine the varying permeability in the steel pipe.  The zero-  sequence impedance can be computed based on information of the  nonuniform current distribution in the phase conductors as well as  the electric field intensity and the total current in the steel  pipe.  Therefore, it is proposed that the major effort be devoted  to obtaining the necessary information in these two respects.  In  the determination of the nonuniform current distribution in the  phase conductors, a Fourier series technique developed in the  proposer's previous research project will be employed, taking into  account the skin effect, the proximity effect and the influence of  the steel pipe.  To compute the electric field intensity and the  total current in the steel pipe, including the circulating current  and the returning zero-sequence current, a set of equations are  formulated based on Faraday's law.  The equations formulated will  be solved by an iterative procedure.  To validate the numerical  techniques developed, it is proposed that measurement of zero-  sequence impedance be performed. The computational results will be  compared with the measurement data.  ***",
