 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are requesting the acquisition of the Beckman model XL-A  analytical ultracentrifuge. This instrument is a  state-of-the-art ultracentrifuge built along guidelines  developed by the leading research experts. Though scarcely  three years old, this instrument has made an impressive  impact in the field with nearly 100 references to its use in  a recent bibliography. It is clear that virtually all  biological researchers pursuing structure-function studies  will include this method in their repertoire in the near  future. No comparable instrument is manufactured elsewhere.  The past near abandonment of this approach is due to several  factors, but the difficulties in maintenance and use of the  old model E instrument are sufficient reasons by themselves.  It is true that accurate alternative methods now exist in  many cases for determining molecular weights of proteins,  e.g., DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry. However,  analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) excels in its  versatility to accommodate a wide range of experimental  conditions and different types of macromolecules. Perhaps  most important is the superiority of AUC in many cases for  analyzing complex associating macromolecules. Another  advantage of AUC is that it is based on rigorous model  equations and is a primary method unlike secondary methods  that require standards and the assumption that these  standards behave in the same manner as the molecule being  studied. In addition, AUC can provide hydrodynamic  parameters from which shapes of macromolecules can be  estimated. Another important advantage of this new AUC  instrument is that it is compatible with computer programs  for controlling and analyzing experiments giving it an  extraordinary advance in user-friendliness. Now even  non-experts can analyze very complex macromolecular systems  utilizing powerful calculation-intensive methods with  relative ease and a modest amount of training and  advisement. These programs continually being improved, are  available through th e internet users groups that also allows  users to access all leaders in this field.          The PI (HOS) of this application has nearly 20 years  of experience using the model E analytical ultracentrifuge  and related methods for studying simple and complex  associating systems. He has even more extensive experience  in computer methods of data analysis - methods that are  especially valuable in analyzing data from the new AUC  instrument.          The projects described in this application depend  extensively on the special advantages of the requested AUC  instrument. For example, the majority of the studies are  concerned with macromolecular associations. It is often true  that two (or more) methods can provide greater insights than  either method alone. Such is the case with AUC also as  illustrated in the project below on polysaccharide  structures. Here the combination of intrinsic viscosity and  sedimentation velocity data provide information on molecular  shape that is independent of the molecular hydration.  Fortunately, we have top-of-the line viscometry and other  modern methods that are complementary to AUC. In summary,  the projects described below are at the forefront of basic  research and will be greatly enhanced by, and in some case  critically dependent on, analytical ultracentrifugation.  This method has remarkable versatility and the current  instrument sought provides outstanding advances in  technology and ease of use.          Currently there is no functional AUC instrument in the  State of OK. However, in ~ relatively short time we have  identified an impressive array of scientists in OK (about  25) who have expressed both a keen desire and an important  need for the XL-A. In addition, many others in OK will  undoubtedly find the instrument extremely helpful to their  research as they become familiar with its capabilities and  their research develops.          Because of its central value in molecular biology and  polymer chemistry and its expected prevalence in future   labs, it is important that our students become familiar with  this instrument and method. We have vigorous research  activities for both undergraduate through postgraduate  students. In addition, we have recently obtained two major  grants serving minorities: a Howard Hughes grant,  \"Undergraduate Biological Sciences Education Program,\" of  $1,000 000. over the next 4 years, and an NSF grant,  \"Oklahoma State Alliance for Minority Participation in  Science\" for $5,000,000 over the next 5 years. Both of these  grants were obtained and are administered by faculty in  Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Upon acquisition of the  instrument, numerous students supported by these programs  will have the opportunity to become trained in this eminent  technology.",
