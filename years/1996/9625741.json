 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cosner  9625741       The investigators study mathematical models for the dynamics  of spatially distributed biological populations.  The main goal of  the research is to provide a better theoretical understanding of  how the spatial aspects of an environment such as size, shape,  and geographic variability can affect populations or communities  inhabiting the environment.  The underlying motivation is to  address questions about such topics as the optimal design for  nature reserves or the likely ecological effects of modifying  environments or introducing new species into them.  The  investigators construct and analyze mathematical models for the  interactions between spatially distributed populations and their  environment and/or other populations.  Most of the models involve  partial differential equations, primarily reaction-diffusion  equations and systems, often with explicit spatial dependence in  the coefficients.  Some of the models are based on specific  biological situations, and others are designed to answer more  general questions about spatial effects.  These two aspects of the  research overlap to some extent.  For example, the investigators  study a model of interactions between aphids and ladybird beetles  that involves multiple spatial scales.  The modeling techniques  are designed to treat that specific system but are also relevant  to other problems involving multiple scales.  A primary goal of  the mathematical analysis is determining whether models predict  extinction or persistence for the populations they describe.  To  address that issue the investigators extend and apply the notion  of uniform persistence from the theory of dynamical systems and  search for alternative approaches to the analysis of persistence.  Other important components of the mathematical methodology are  nonlinear analysis (especially bifurcation theory and related  topics), maximum principles and comparison methods, and the  spectral theory of elliptic operators.  A secondary research goal  is to  obtain new mathematical results that are useful in the  context of applications.       The investigators study ways of using mathematics to  understand ecological problems.  The problems mostly involve  spatial aspects of the environment; for example, how to design  the most effective type of buffer zones for nature reserves, or  how to predict the likely effects of the fragmentation of natural  habitats on the populations that inhabit them.  The problems also  involve interactions between different biological species, for  example predators and prey.  The methodology is to express the  essential features of a biological system in terms of equations  and then to perform a mathematical analysis of the equations to  determine what they predict.  The analysis often requires the  development of new mathematical results, which may be of use to  other investigators.  A typical goal of the analysis is to  determine the effects of various environmental and biological  factors on the persistence or extinction of populations.  A  reason for using mathematical models is that in situations  involving endangered species, genetically engineered organisms,  or large scale environmental change, it is often impossible to do  experiments but crucial to have some idea of what to expect.  Some of the models are directly motivated by problems in refuge  design or pest control.  Others are motivated by basic scientific  questions about the effects of the spatial aspects of  environments on populations, but even those may eventually prove  to be relevant to issues raised in the contexts of environmental  protection and the biological effects of global change.",
