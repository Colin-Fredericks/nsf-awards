 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent years have seen an explosion of interest among scientists attempting to understand the  long term effects of interaction between humans and plant and animal species which have only  recently become extinct in Madagascar.  This involves documenting environmental change there  through time.  Such change is also reflected by variations in primate community structure in  different times and places on that island.   As humans and the fauna and flora of this island increasingly come into conflict, scholarship  relating to the causes of extinction, the proper husbanding of biological resources, and insights  about the protection of endangered life forms have gained prominence.  Research on extinction  processes comes from analyzing the past.  Specifically, advances in knowledge of the  human-animal/plant interaction can come about by gathering new dates for times of occurence  of various animals in the past by finding new and more informative skeletal parts of these  vanished animals, especially giant lemurs.  This research elucidates their lifestyles and  potentially will provide better dated evidence of contemporaneity between humans and giant  lemurs.  These findings document human predation on the vanished lemurs.  Much light should  be shed on the timing and causes of giant lemur extinction.  Through this award, the team of  researchers expects to extend previous collections and produce new publications.  The timing of primate extinctions in Madagascar will be further documented by radiocarbon  dates for plant and animal fossils from particular sites.  A controversy exists as to the primary  cause for giant lemur extinction in Madagascar:  whether by disease, environmental change, or  human hands.  The project proposes to discover new dates that should establish the temporal  length of the wave of extinctions in Madagascar and better document environmental change.   The giant extinct lemurs of Madagascar include most of the kinds of really bizarre relatives of  humans ever to have existed on earth.  Better anatomical knowledge of these animals will  contribute significantly to understanding the extremes of potential adaptive range within our  own Order of mammals.   Many of these fossils are found in extremely remote parts of Madagascar in nearly inaccessible  caves causing the project to make heavy demands on field equipment and to make use of trained  caving experts.  The project is a continuation of a long time research cooperation between the  Cenozoic Research Group of the University of Antananarivo and the Duke University Primate  Center.",
