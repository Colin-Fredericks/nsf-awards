 "awd_abstract_narration": "Liquid free surface sloshing in moving containers can occur  in the form of one of three possible regimes: linear planar  motion, weakly nonlinear non-planar motion, or strongly  nonlinear motion characterized by hydrodynamic impacts. The  interaction of the second or third regime with the dynamics  of the supporting elastic structure has direct impact on the  roll stability and safety of liquid tankers and automotive  vehicles carrying gasoline tanks. The main objective of this  research project is to develop analytical, numerical, and  experimental tools to examine the stability and dynamic  characteristic of these systems in order to improve their  rollover stability. To accomplish this objective, analytical  models are developed which are capable of describing liquid  pressure impacts in moving partially filled tankers. The  liquid pressure impact model is formulated based on  representing the impact forces by a visco-elastic high power  nonlinear damper. The resulting equations of motion are  analyzed using nonlinear `non-smooth` generating solutions  rather than trigonometric functions commonly used for weakly  nonlinear systems. For weakly nonlinear regime, a unified  approach combining the method of normal form and the theory  of Lie groups is used to study the liquid-structure  interaction in the presence of internal resonance. The  validity of analytical results are verified by numerical  simulation and experimental tests. The numerical simulations  estimate the system response for both liquid sloshing  regimes. The stability and characterization of the response  are examined by numerically estimating the Lyapunov  exponents and embedding dimensions. The experimental tests  provide additional safety study regarding the favorable  locations of baffles, to be inserted in liquid containers,  which enhances the roll stability of liquid tankers. Another  contribution of this research is to develop realistic models  describing liquid sloshing impacts which can be used for  vehicle dynamic simulation, and also that can be introduced  in multibody dynamics codes.",
