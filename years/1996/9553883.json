 "awd_abstract_narration": "9553883  Stanley    Computer visualization and modeling techniques from current multidisciplinary research are used in simulation experiments to provide a basis for students to learn how microscopic processes such as intermolecular collisions determine macroscopic processes such as temperature, pressure, and the laws relating them. A modular set of materials is produced that allows students to discover a molecular-scale view of a wide range of materials from liquids to proteins and other polymers.  Special emphasis is placed on investigations of water.  Students compare the results of  computer simulations with closely integrated, hands-on laboratory activities and are challenged to think as research scientists do about scientific theory and modeling.  The simulations run on Pentium-based computers.  The materials include a CDROM containing complete teacher support material for installing and running computer programs, for performing hands-on activities, and for constructing experimental apparatus.  Materials are also available on the WWW which provides teacher support and exchange of ideas.  Experimental materials demonstrated that teachers changed their practice from lecturing to mentoring and concrete learners increased their understanding of the microscopic world.",
