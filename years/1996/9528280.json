Smithsonian Institution  Title: The Climatic and Environmental History of the Amazon Basin         Since the Last Glacial Maximum    This award will contribute to the reconstruction of the vegetation  and climate history of the Amazon Basin at the last glacial maximum  using.  The project will focus on core-drilling and pollen analysis  of the sediments of ancient Amazonian lakes.  A climatic history of  the Amazon (an area roughly as large as the continental U.S.) is  necessary for calibrating global climate models.  Changes in three  climate parameters in ice-age time are likely: CO2, temperature, and  precipitation.  Research to date has developed ice-age temperature  records at six sites in the tropical Americans.  Pollen evidence  shows changes in the range of temperature-sensitive plants  suggesting cooling by 6oC.  This cooling suggests also that tropical  rainforest occupied the lowlands of the Amazon basin in glacial  times, where the effects of cooling should have been least.  Pollen  from a drill core through the Amazon fan also suggests that dry  vegetation was no more prevalent in the ice-age than it is today.   The goal of the present project is to test these conclusions with  cores from ancient lakes in the Amazon `asin.  The prime method of  paleoclimate and paleoecological reconstruction will be pollen  analysis, calibrated by a program of surface pollen sampling.  This  work will allow reliable general conclusions both about the ice-age  climate and the recent history of the world's most diverse forest.",
