 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    PI:  Brodie  Proposal Number:  9600775    CAREER Award: Inheritance and Maternal Effects of Parental  Care Behavior       Evolution is necessarily a genetic process. While much  insight into behavioral  ecology has been made without  consideration of patterns of inheritance, there  is much to  be gained from a genetic perspective.  In particular,  parental care  behavior is a category of trait that is  likely to have complex effects on   offspring characters and fitness, and thereby on the  evolutionary process.   Understanding the importance and  origin of parental care in species as diverse  as insects  and humans depends on a knowledge of the underlying genetics  of the  behavior.   Mothers and other relatives often  influence the expression of traits in offspring through the  care they provide.  The importance of these so-called 'non-  genetic maternal effects' in determining offspring traits is  well known.  However, maternal effects have generally been  considered evolutionarily uninteresting, because only  genetic components of traits respond to natural selection.  In the last 5-10 years, theoretical advances have changed  this view, suggesting that non-genetic maternal effects can  drive evolution. Because many maternal effects are thought  to stem from  parental care behavior, this new body of theory suggests  that the evolutionary origins and consequences of behavior  may be more complex than previously imagined.  Despite these  exciting implications, maternal effects of behavior have  rarely been studied in natural systems.   Strawberry arrow  poison frogs (Dendrobates pumilio) present a unique and  fascinating system in which to quantify parental care  behavior and its effect on offspring characters.  Male frogs  attract females to a territory, where 3-6 eggs are laid on  land.  For the next 10-15 days, the male guards and  periodically waters the eggs until  tadpoles emerge.  The female then returns and individually  transports ea ch tadpole to a separate rearing site, usually  a water-filled plant axil.  For the next 3 months, the  female visits each tadpole every few days, and lays  unfertilized eggs for her offspring to eat.  Tadpoles have  specialized mouth parts and can only eat eggs.  This  specialized parental care lends itself to simple  quantification.  D. pumilio are easily bred and raised in  captivity.  The proposed work combines studies of  inheritance and maternal effects under captive conditions  with studies of fitness consequences of parental care in  nature to address the evolutionary consequences of parental  care behavior.  Complex breeding designs that include cross-  fostering offspring among unrelated parents will be used to  quantify the maternal effect of both male and female  parental care on offspring traits including development and  morphology.  Two generations of frogs will reared in the  laboratory so that the inheritance of parental care behavior  itself can be understood.  A separate field project will  investigate how paternal and maternal care influence  offspring phenotypes and survival under natural conditions.  The three phases of this study - inheritance, maternal  effects  and fitness consequences - will combine to offer new insight  into the evolution of parental care.   The proposed research will generate and maintain a large  captive colony of strawberry arrow poison frogs at the  University of Kentucky that will be a valuable resource for  formal undergraduate education and public outreach.  A small  walk-in rainforest room will be constructed to generate a  hands-on learning experience.  The frog colony also will be  used in exercises incorporated into several large upper  level courses.  The use of this colony in undergraduate  classes will also provide a direct example of the  kinds of biodiversity present in tropical rainforests to  students who would otherwise never be exposed.  Additionally, undergraduate students will be heavily  involved at all levels of this research.   A number of  undergraduates will be employed by this project to assist  with data collection and colony maintenance. Regular  laboratory meetings will involve students at every step of  work, so that they experience the full process of science  from the generation of hypotheses to the design and  execution of experiments to the tedium of behavioral data  collection.The Dendrobates colony also provides a rare  opportunity for  undergraduates to conduct independent research on behavior.",
