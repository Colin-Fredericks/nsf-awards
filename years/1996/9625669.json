 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores a new approach to sequencing by  hybridization (SBH), which uses     interaction to  dramatically reduce the number of oligonucleotides for de  novo sequencing of large DNA fragments, while preserving the  parallelism which is the primary advantage of  SBH.  The  goals of the project include: (1) Development of efficient  algorithms for the interactive design of sequencing chips;  and (2) Utilization of simulation results to establish that  64kb fragments can be sequenced (obtained using  approximately ten  rounds of standard-sized 64k oligonucleotide arrays).  The  project includes the following theoretical and laboratory  research in interactive SBH: (a) In a collaborative effort  with  biochemists at Oxford University, England, algorithmic  issues in the design and  manufacture SBH arrays, under a variety of fabrication  technologies, are examined; (b) Algorithmic issues inherent  in reconstructing DNA sequences from hybridization  data, under complications such as non-classical chip designs  and hybridization errors, are studied; and (c) Algorithmic  issues inherent in other novel variations of SBH,  particularly  photolithography-based interactive SBH and positional SBH,  are investigated.  This project is jointly funded with the  Computational Biological Activity.***",
