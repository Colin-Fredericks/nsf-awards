 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Scott Fedick, MS Jennifer Mathews will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will conduct archaeological research at the Mayan site of Naranjal which is located in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. Based on past research it appears that Naranjal predates the Classic Maya period. A total of 21 major structures have been identified, most characterized by a `megalithic style` which employed large well-dressed stones in construction. Many of the blocks are wedge or pie-shaped and over a meter in length. Remains of plaster on facing stones indicate that they were thickly coated to from a smooth exterior surface and this style is distinctly different in appearance from others in different parts of the Mayan area. MS. Mathews' work will focus on this phenomenon. She will excavate several structures in order to describe in detail  both construction techniques and finished product. Plaster samples will be collected and the charcoal inclusions they contain will be extracted for radiocarbon dating. Finally comparisons will be made with similar structures in other sites in the region.  The Mayan region has long constituted a focus for archaeological study because it witnessed the rise of large complex societies in a hostile lowland tropical environment. While many sites have been carefully excavated, researchers still do not understand in detail how these related to each other, the extent of regional interaction and political integration at the inter site scale. To what extent were individual units grouped together into regional alliances and larger functional groupings? If they exist, at what stage in Mayan prehistory did they develop? MS Mathews conducts her research in the Northern Mayan region where relatively little is known and she wishes to address this basic question. She has noted what appears to be a distinct regional architectural style which appears to reflect such a regional interaction sphere and she will determine whether or not her guess is correct. Through the radiocarbon samples she collects, absolute dates will be provided for these structures.  This research is important for several reasons. It will shed new light on the process of the development of complex societies. It will help to pioneer a new use for radiocarbon dating which may be applied to archaeological sites in many parts of the world and finally it will assist in training a promising young scientist.",
