 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632058  STATES    Aimed movements are a ubiquitous part of everyday life.  Of  particular importance is their central role in situations  involving the transfer of information between people and machines  (e.g., mouse movements by computer users, control stick movements  by pilots and heavy machine operators, etc.).  A  fundamental  constraint on the control of aimed movements is described by  speed-accuracy tradeoffs (SATs), i.e., faster movements are less  accurate.    Using the stochastic optimized-submovement model (SOSM) proposed  by David Meyer and his associates as a starting point, this  research will investigate the control of aimed movements in four  areas:  (a) the generality of SATs for multi-joint movements, (b)  transfer of practice effects across the SATs, (c) the existence  of corrective submovements during aimed movement, and (d) what is  learned as SATs improve.  The SOSM provides only one of several  theoretical frameworks within which the results of this research  can be interpreted.  The research is, therefore, intended to (a)  probe the empirical limits of these existing theories, (b)  resolve fundamental disputes among these theories concerning the  nature of the control of aimed movements, and (c) gather the  database required either to elaborate one of the existing models  or to propose a new theoretical framework, depending upon the  nature of the results.    Through a better understanding of aimed movements, this research  should provide insights into how to structure control tasks.  In  addition, because the research includes both studies of how  individuals differ in the nature and their use of submovements  and studies of how performance improves when individuals practice  aimed movements, it will shed light on issues such as personnel  selection and how to organize training for jobs involving person-  machine interaction through aimed movements.    ***",
