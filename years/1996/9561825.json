 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate the system architectures that can efficiently utilize the unique multi-fiber multiwavelength routing capability of Waveguide Grating Router (WGR) in a variety of application environments. Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) has been demonstrated as a feasible technology to more fully utilize the vast optical bandwidth in the point-to-point communications. The extension of WDM technology into a switched networking environment based on wavelength routing concept reveals a new set of challenging issues. In addition to device technology and algorithms on network topology, a critical issue here is the development of efficient and cost-effective systems or subsystems that use wavelength routing for performance enhancement. Combining wavelength multiplexers/demultiplexers with optical switches provides maximum flexibility, but the number of switch crosspoints generally increases linearly with the number of wavelengths used. The high cost, fabrication complexity, and large insertion loss make acoustooptic tunable filters unattractive for commercial application in the foreseeable future. An innovative approach is required which combines Waveguide Grating Router (WGR) with simple active devices. The Phase I effort of this SBIR will design a system architecture that can exploit the unique wavelength routing capability of WGR device in a wide range of application environments. Results of our initial investigation are also presented.       Wavelength routing has enormous potential applications in high-speed computer networking or telecommunication infrastructure. By utilizing the unique feature of WGR devices, results from this research effort should greatly benefit the nation in the cost-effective realization of wavelength routing for performance enhancement in a variety of applications.",
