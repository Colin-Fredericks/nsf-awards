 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Hounshell and members of the Carnegie Mellon University Department of History are directing an STS `Small Grant for Training and Research` (SGTR) to support  a sustained research and training program focused on science and technology during the Cold War.  They have chosen this area because they have already developed an excellent set of core competencies to advance research on Cold War science and technology while also serving an important training function.    Cold War science and technology is a subject that continues to be an important area for STS and, with its end, represents enormous opportunities for pursuing new sources, new approaches and new questions for researchers.  Further, the NSF Workshop on Cold War Science and Technology, which Dr. Hounshell directed, noted, fundamental questions about science, technology, and democracy during the Cold War remain to be resolved.  These questions go well beyond the community of practitioners in science and technology studies.    This SGTR will support three graduate students, a postdoctoral fellow and a Research Colloquium in Cold War Science and Technology.  The support will help focus the students and postdocs' research and instruction in a concerted manner on issues of great importance for the future of S&T in a post-Cold War era.",
