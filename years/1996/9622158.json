 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622158  Throne  Each year approximately 250,000 people succumb to potentially  lethal cardiac tachyarrhythmias (fast abnormal heart beats) in  the United States.  Of these, only 10% survive to undergo further  treatment.  Treatment options include drug therapy--which has  numerous side effects and often does not work--implantable  devices--which treat only the symptoms and incur significant  initial and follow-up costs or surgical removal of the source of  the arrhythmia.  Surgery is often the most effective treatment,  in that it is a cure for arrhythmia, but identifying the focal  site is difficult and time-consuming.  Systematic methods for  extrapolating electrical voltages measured on the body surface to  electrical voltages on the heart (the inverse problem of  electrocardiography) could greatly improve the ability to locate  the focus of the arrhythmia before surgery, lower the time in  surgery and provide a low-cost, noninvasive initial screening of  those patients likely to succumb to these arrhythmias.    The Departments of Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering  and Internal Medicine (Section of Cardiology) at the University  of Nebraska will purchase an engineering workstation server and  mapping equipment which will be dedicated to support research in  biomedical engineering.  The equipment, which expands the  capabilities of existing facilities, will be used primarily for  research on inverse electrocardiography.  The ability to solve  the inverse problem of electrocardiography accurately, which is  the focus of the research, directly implies the ability to  noninvasively create an accurate picture of the electrical  activity of the heart.  This picture, in turn, makes it possible  to more accurately diagnose and treat heart conduction-related  illnesses.  The collaboration between theoretical engineering  scientists and practicing medical researchers/clinicians will  allow the study of methods from numerical theories through to  eventual clinical trials, giving the abilit y to improve patient  care in the near future.  ***",
