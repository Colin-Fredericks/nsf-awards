Ganesan, Krishnamurthy    Florida Atlantic University    Empirical Software Engineering Laboratory  for Research in Software Engineering      The proposed Empirical Software Engineering Laboratory supports following  research projects in software engineering.   (1)  Modeling of Software Quality Using Artificial Neural Networks for improving the accuracy of software quality models by conducting case studies exploring neural network architectures and training algorithms.  (2) Measurement and Validation of Software Testability for characterizing relationships between testability and static software metrics, and for determining whether or not testability measurement can enhance software reliability prediction.   Case studies to address these issues empirically are used.  (3) Fuzzy Case-Based Reasoning for  identifying  fuzzy case-based methods for software quality prediction by developing prototype systems using industrial case study data.     These research projects are making significant contributions by   characterizing ways that people actually develop software by using   data on large systems from industrial partners which have  professional development organizations. The equipment includes five high performance engineering workstations that are significantly faster than others that are available. Purchased software includes measurement and modeling tools that are specifically applicable to the projects. Thus, the hardware and software of the Empirical Software Engineering Laboratory are critical to the above research projects.",
