 "awd_abstract_narration": "MCB-9513231  Dawson  Haploid cells (e.g., eggs and sperm) are formed from diploid cells by two rounds of chromosome distribution called meiosis.  In the first round,  the two members of each homologous chromosome pair are drawn to opposite poles.  For each haploid cell to receive all the genetic information in the proper number of copies, it is essential that this segregation of homologs be accurate.  In most eukaryotic organisms, meiotic exchange between homologous chromosomes is required for this segregation to be successful. Mutants with defects in meiotic recombination are frequently sterile or exhibit reduced fertility. Meiotic crossovers serve to physically link homologs, and in conjunction with an activity referred to as chiasma binder activity, hold the homologs stably together until they are properly attached to the meiotic spindle and migrate away from each other at anaphase I. Despite the importance of crossovers in enhancing the fidelity of meiotic chromosome segregation, little is known about the factors that influence the ability of crossovers to perform their meiotic role.  %%%  The long term goal of the investigator's  laboratory is to contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the apparatus which utilizes crossovers and other factors to keep homologs joined until anaphase I, thus ensuring meiotic disjunction.  These experiments will utilized the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a research organism.    The objective of this project is to determine the characteristics of recombination events which do and so not ensure the disjunction of YLps.  Experiments will be performed to determine the characteristics of crossovers with different abilities to enhance disjunction.  The chromosomal location of recombination eventq, t he sequences in which crossovers occur, and the relationship of meiotic DSBs to the generation of crossovers which ensure disjunction will be explored.  The experiments are designed to test four models that describe why crossovers are not equally able to ensure  disjunction.  These models follow:  1.  The ability of a crossover to enhance segregation is influenced by its distance from the telomere, or 2. by its distance from the centromere.  3.  Some sequence environments allow nearby crossovers to ensure disjunction while others do not.  4.  The ability of a crossover to ensure disjunction is related to the manner in which the crossover is initiated.  ***",
