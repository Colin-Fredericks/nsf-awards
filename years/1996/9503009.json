The  experiments are unique in that they probe a broad frequency range, at  low temperatures, where deviations from conventional Fermi liquid  behavior can be pronounced. The experiments will provide important  tests of theories of non-Fermi liquids. The project involves low  temperatures, to 0.35 Kelvin, and high magnetic fields, to 9 Tesla.  The materials to be investigated include UPt3, a conventional Fermi  liquid, and suspected non-Fermi liquid alloys, cerium-copper-gold and  uranium-yttrium-palladium, as well as two-dimensional organic metals.  The work is of fundamental interest, but the results may also bear on  other important non-Fermi liquid materials such as the high  temperature superconductors.  %%%  This project looks at the response of unusual metallic systems,  including so-called organic metals, to a broad range of  electromagnetic radiation (light). The response to the radiation is  measured at very low temperatures and at very high magnetic fields.  The motivation of the work is to understand differences in the  response of these materials as compared to ordinary metals, whose  electrical properties are much better understood. The experiments are  technically complex and can only be carried out in a few laboratories  in the world. The materials to be investigated include UPt3, a  conventional metallic material, the suspected non-conventional metal  alloys: cerium-copper-gold and uranium-yttrium-palladium, as well as  two-dimensional \"organic\" metals. The work is of fundamental interest,  but the results may also bear on other important non-Fermi liquid  materials such as the high temperature superconductors.  ***",
