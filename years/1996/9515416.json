 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to examine the effect of various  government policies on international asset returns, including  exchange rates.  The first project analyizes whether problems  similar to what has occurred recently with the peso which arise  from monetary policy changes can explain anomalous behavior in  the interest rate term structure.  It is postulated that monetary  policy affects the stochastic process underlying interest rates  and exchange rates in such a way that it induces econometric  inference problems.     The second project  examines monetary policy in the U.S. and  Germany proposing non-linear policy rules for both countries.   The dynamic effects of policy shocks on real and nominal exchange  rates and interest rate differentials and their predictability  are examined both in the context of a non-linear vector  autoregressive setting and in the context of an equilibrium  model.  The third proposed project focuses on real exchange rates  in the context of a dynamic economy with non-traded goods, in  particular houses.  The main issue addressed is the relative  variability of real and nominal exchange rate changes versus  inflation rates.    A final issue to be examined is the effect of government policies  on the degree of integration of emerging equity markets with  global capital markets and on economic growth.  An empirical  methodology is developed to test whether financial market  integration and stock market development contribute to economic  growth.  This project also involves the development of new and  better indicators of financial market integration and stock  market development for a set of developing countries.",
