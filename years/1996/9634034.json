The project's partners,the unified districts of Chandler, Sunnyside, Nogales, Mingus and Sedona-Oak Creek, Maricopa County Community College, Arizona State University and the Intel Corporation, will implement the Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP) in those districts through the use of seven integrated components:  1)  inservice on the mathematics and pedagogy of IMP, 2)  follow-up support activities, 3)  internal capacity for professional development, 4)  school teams for support of teachers, 5)  teachers from schools considering IMP, 6)  articulation with feeder schools, and 7)  impact on preservice teacher training.  In addition to the high school teachers, support teams consisting of school administrators, counselors and other teachers, teams of middle school teachers that feed into the participating high schools, teams from schools considering the implementation of new curriculum materials, and personnel from each of the three state universities will take part in the professional development activities.  Additional school districts will join the project in years three and four.    There is cost sharing equivalent to 244% of the NSF funding.",
