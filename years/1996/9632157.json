 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Rebecca Conry, Department of Chemistry, University of Nevada, is   supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of   the Chemistry Division under a Research Planning Grant to prepare soluble   copper complexes that will act as homogeneous catalysts for the reduction   of carbon dioxide.  Three types of low-valent copper complexes including   Cu(I) hydrides, Cu(0) complexes, and heterobimetallic copper/zinc systems   will be investigated for their ability to reduce carbon dioxide.    Multi-electron reduction pathways will be a primary focus of this work.   These planning activities will advance Dr. Conry's career by providing a   basis for preparing a competitive NSF research proposal subsequent to the   completion of this Research Planning Grant.   Activation of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide is important because of   its implications for global warming. Three strategies for catalytically   reducing carbon dioxide are proposed which utilize copper in a variety of   oxidation states and coordination environments. Current industrial   processes which involve reactions with solid surfaces form the basis for   the compounds proposed.  The reactivity of the copper compounds will be   explored in homogeneous solution with the ultimate goal of converting   carbon dioxide into useful products.",
