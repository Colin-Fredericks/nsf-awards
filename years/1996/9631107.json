 "awd_abstract_narration": "9631107  Beauge    Calcium (Ca) ions act as transducers of the information  reaching the cell surface into a language known by the cell  interior in nearly all animal cells.  Changes in  intracellular calcium concentrations is the signal that  activates functions like hormone secretion, muscle  contraction, and nerve-cell communication. The actual signal  is a large increase in the concentration of the  intracellular Ca, after which the Ca concentration returns  rapidly to the \"resting\" levels.  The research funded by  this grant is directed at one of the mechanisms responsible  for the \"recovery\" of resting Ca concentration levels -  sodium (Na) ion/calcium ion exchange.  The emphasis is on  the control of this exchange system by  two phosphoryl group  donors:  ATP and phosphoarginine. This work is carried out  on a giant axon in the squid where the internal and external  environments can be controlled by the experimenters..    Understanding the mechanisms by which Na-Ca exchange is  regulated is crucial for understanding the mechanisms that  underlie neural signaling in all animals.  In addition, it  is crucial for understanding muscle contraction.",
