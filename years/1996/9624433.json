 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS-9624433    The objective of this research is the design of novel heterogeneous catalysts for emission control  applications.  In particular, the research  focuses on two applications:  the removal of NOx via its selective catalytic reduction with hydrocarbons (hydrocarbon-SCR) under excess oxygen (\"lean\") conditions; and the simultaneous removal of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The proposed research uses kinetic and in-situ spectroscopic characterization techniques. The different reaction pathways involved in the overall reaction networks, the reactive intermediates, and the active surface sites are identified. These findings are correlated with the structural properties of existing catalysts and used to provide important leads for the design and synthesis of the next generation of catalytic systems.  This research could lead to a novel, hydrothermally stable hydrocarbon-SCR catalyst that would find commercial use in both mobile and stationary emission control applications, while a new bifunctional catalyst for the simultaneous removal of NOx and clilorinated VOCs would find an immediate use in controlling emissions from municipal and medical waste-incineration units and a long-term use in controlling emissions from the chlorochemical and the coating industries.     The proposed educational plan includes the development of new courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels and the continuous involvement of  undergraduate and graduate students in research. The new courses include a freshman-level course in chemical manufacturing, a senior-level elective course in environmental engineering, and a graduate-level course in heterogeneous catalysis.",
