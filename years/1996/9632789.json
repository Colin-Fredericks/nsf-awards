The essentials  of  mesoscopic  physics   are   explored  by  exploiting  the   analogy   between  electromagnetic    propagation   and   electronic    conductance.  Statistical distributions and correlations in the local field and  in  global quantities such as the transmission and conductance in  translucent, diffusing and localizing samples will be studied and  characterized.  The  dimensionless  conductance  is  changed   by  varying the scattering medium and its length and diameter and  by  tuning  through  the mobility edge in periodic metallic  networks  filled   with random mixture of scatterers. Universal aspects  of  wave  dynamic are revealed in the statistics of the phase of  the  transmitted field. The possibilities of acousto-optic imaging use  diffuse  light  and  the nature and  applications  of  lasing  in  random systems will be investigates.  %%%  Classical  wave propagation is the means by which  we  probe  our  environment  and  communicate  with  one  another.  The  proposal  explores   the  fundamental  statistic  of  light  and  microwave  propagation in collections of samples with statiscally equivalent  disorder. It will establish the connection between the statistics  of  the local fields and the total transmitt3ed radiation and the  optic  conductance. This will improve our understanding  of  wave  propagation   and  of  giant  fluctuation  in  transmission   and  conductance  which occur in the transition from  a  situation  in  which waves can propagate to one in which transport is inhibited.  It is thus a useful model of electronic transport in microcircuit  which  are  of  increasing importance in modern electronics.  The  possibilities of acousto-optic imaging using diffuse light  as  a  noninvasive  mammography   modality  will  be  investigated.   The  characteristics and applications of lasing in random systems will  also be explored.  ***",
