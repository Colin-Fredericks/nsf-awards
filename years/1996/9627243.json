The  meetings are designed to bring together a select group of  the nation's best young engineers from industry, academe,  and government laboratories to discuss pioneering technical  work and leading edge research in various engineering fields  and industry sectors.  The goal of the symposia is to  introduce the nation's outstanding young engineers to each  other, and through this interaction facilitate collaboration  in engineering and the transfer of new techniques and  approaches across fields.    The First Annual Symposium on Frontiers of Engineering was  held September 12-23, 1995 at the Academies' Beckman Center  in Irvine, California, being sponsored jointly by the  National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense, the  National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the  Engineering Foundation.",
