 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Maryland Undergraduate Mathematics Enhancement Program II  (MUMEP II) is a coalition of community college, 4-year college, and  university undergraduate mathematics teaching faculty in the  general region of Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Virginia,  organized around a two-year faculty enhancement program for 32  participants during each of the years 1996 and 1997. In July 1996  a one-week workshop will explore Visual Thinking in Chaotic  Dynamics and in July 1997 a one-week workshop will explore Visual  Thinking in Fractal Geometry.  A pair of day-long follow-up  seminars will take place during the academic year following each  workshop. The primary goals of MUMEP II are: 1) to present new  visual mathematical topics to faculty from institutions in the  region and to use graphics calculators and computer graphics to  enhance understanding of the new visual mathematical topics; 2) to  relate the new visual mathematics topics to existing undergraduate  mathematics courses wherever reasonable; 3) to promote  communication and collaboration among faculty in the area's  institutions. In addition, special teacher preparation activities  are planned to engage faculty who teach significant numbers of pre-  service teachers. In particular, the project's recruiting efforts  will look for opportunities to involve such faculty, and workshop  activities will showcase lessons that can be incorporated in  mathematics classes taken by prospective teachers and in school  mathematics classes as well. All materials prepared for or during  a workshop or seminar will be disseminated during the session or  shortly thereafter.  Under the guidance of members of an Advisory  Board, evaluation of the program will be facilitated through daily  and summary questionnaires.",
