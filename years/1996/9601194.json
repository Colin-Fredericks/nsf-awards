 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tropical Field Stations (TFS) generate information vital to the  advance of ecological, evolutionary, biosystematic knowledge, as  well as providing core data relevant to sociological, biological  and economic processes directly related to the conservation and  management of tropical ecosystems. TFS are characterized by being  sites at remote locations in less developed countries, often used  on a temporary basis by researchers from different home  institutions, and whose interactions are restricted by  disciplinary, cultural, national and language barriers.  Nonetheless, they hold an important key to unveiling the effects  of climate change and the principles of ecosystem management in  the tropics.    In spite of the importance of preserving and making accessible  the information generated at TFS, there is no consensus on the  guidelines that should regulate data documentation, generation of  metadata sets or overall data management at these sites.  Furthermore, TFS are not yet connected among themselves with a  suitable communications network. This lack of a framework  restricts comparative analysis and jeopardizes the long-term  utility of the data sets. Some characteristics of TFS --such as  remote locations in less developed countries and their  multidisciplinary, multilingual, and transcultural set of users--  are, in part, responsible for their underdeveloped stage  regarding data management and connectivity.    In cooperation with other leading tropical stations, the  Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS) proposes the development  of a planning process (consisting of two phases: needs-analysis  and prototype development) that will seek a consensus on the  guidelines that will effectively regulate data management and  accessibility at neotropical field stations.    Expected products are: (i) a document specifying the needs and  characteristics of data management and connectivity in TFS; (ii)  a consensus on basic guidelines and recommendations for data  management and connectivity  issues; (iii) a tested prototype for  later implementation involving a large array of field stations;  (iv) a report on the procedures applied and the problems and  solutions generated; and (v) a proposal for wider implementation  of interconnected data management systems at neotropical field  stations.                                                                                            iv",
