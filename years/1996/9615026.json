 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615026  Barnard    A simple method has been developed for fabrication of novel  nanostructured magnetic 'networks' which exhibit unique and  useful magnetic properties.  The networks are highly unusual  in that their dimensionality can be controlled continuously  at the nanometer scale allowing for exploration of confined  geometries ranging from zero dimensional 'dots' to one  dimensional porous networks to two dimensional films (as  well as topologies with intermediate dimensions) depending  on substrate nanostructure and network thickness.  In  preliminary studies on iron networks, dramatic enhancements  in coercivity have been observed (two orders of magnitude  higher than the equivalent thin film value) which are a  direct result of the confinement of the iron to a network  topology with critical dimensions in the range of tens of  nanometers.  In this research program the role of both the  network material and the nanostructure of the substrate will  be assessed.  Comparative studies of ferromagnets with  differing saturation magnetizations will be carried out to  determine whether  the strong shape anisotropy of the  network is the primary mechanism of coercivity enhancement.  The effect of the topology of the nanostructured substrate  on magnetic properties of the deposited network will be  studied using porous substrates with smaller pore diameters  and more variable porosity than is available commercially.  This part of the work will be carried out by anodically  oxidizing single crystal silicon wafers.  Electrochemical  process parameters will be used to independently control  pore diameter and arrangement as well as porosity.  Magnetic  characterization aimed at understanding the magnetization  (and magnetization reversal) process along with the magnetic  domain structure will be carried out using temperature and  time dependent hysteresis studies and magnetic force  microscopy. Precise dimensions of the networks and their  crystallography be determined by transmission electron  mic roscopy.  %%%  The simple fabrication of very thin, magnetically 'hard'  materials is important in the context of the development of  the next generation recording media.  The unique network  topology under study has important technological  implications.  For example, a particularly difficult  challenge is the striction problem encountered when flying a  recording head very close to the storage media.  Conventional thin film media are typically roughened by  mechanical or chemical means to minimize this problem.  The  unique surface topography of the networks should give rise  to low values of stiction without further processing which  will enable lower flying heights and higher recording  densities.  ***",
