ABSTRACT                                      Behavioral Interactions and Population Responses Between Male  Tr  eefrogs                   Scinax rubra and Scinax garbei      PI:  Godfrey R. Bourne  Proposal Number:  9630428         This  study was prompted by my observations that loss of their  closed-canopy, old second growth rainforest habitat to lumbering,  has  caused the Neotropical treefrog Scinax garbei to  move  into  open-canopy  brushy,  second  growth  habitats  occupied   by   a  congener, S. rubra at Dubulay Ranch, Guyana. The appearance of S.  garbei in these new habitats coincided with declining numbers  of  S.  rubra.  Males  of these two species gather on  vegetation  at  temporary  ponds  and  large puddles for  advertisement  calling.  Vocal  communication plays an important role in establishing  the  structure   and  organization  of  frog  groups  or  communities.  Advertisement  calls  of  male frogs  contain  information  about  species identity, location, and individual characteristics of the  caller.  In addition to attracting females, vocalization mediates  spacing   among  males.  In  assemblages  consisting  of  several  species, interference from different species' signals transmitted  through  the  same communication channel is a potentially  strong  evolutionary  force shaping characteristics of call  signals  and  structure  of  communities.  Interactions  that  solely   involve  resources  of  communication  are  called  acoustic  competition.  Acoustic  interference may be reduced by: i) spectral  separation  of  calls  by  simultaneously  signalling  species;  ii)  spatial  separation of species; or iii) temporal separation of calling  by  species  in  the  same  habitat. Spatial separation  may  involve  differences  in geographic range, microhabitat or  calling  site.  Shifts  in  species composition and the inclusion  of  additional  species into a frog community may depend on: i) the existence  of  vaca nt acoustic niches; or ii) the ability of a species to modify  its  call  frequency,  timing of calling,  or  use  of  space  in  response  to  other  members of the community.  Although  several  studies  have  examined mechanisms of acoustic competition  among  frog   species,  I  am  not  aware  of  any  studies  that   have  experimentally  addressed  their  consequences  for  populations.  Thus, I predict that inhibition of calling by one species because  of  calling by another, is likely to impact temporal and  spatial  use  of  habitat, and population size, of the poorer  competitor.  The  effect  of  S.  garbei on contemporary frog  communities  is  largely  unknown,  although  it may  compete  with  other  Scinax  species  at various locations. Competitive effects are known  for  the Neotropical, island dwelling whistling frog Eleutherodactylus  johnstonei  which  impacts native and introduced  species  during  range expansion by accidental introduction. Here I outline  a  12  month  (1 September 1996-31 August 1997) field project to examine  the  effects  of invading S. garbei on the calling  behavior  and  population  densities  of S. rubra at Dubulay  Ranch,  and  CEIBA  Biological  Center, Guyana. I will answer three questions--1)  Do  males  of  the  two  species compete and what are  the  resources  competed for? 2) What are the consequences of competition to  the  populations?  3)  What are the mechanisms of  competition?  Using  four  large  study  plots  with two  replicates  and  four  large  enclosures, and using a sophisticated statistical design, I  will  examine the relationships of S. garbei and S. rubra behaviors and  population  sizes  to different levels of frog species  removals,  and  stocking  densities.  Data on the  effects  of  a  naturally  occurring  range  expansion  of  a  congeneric  species  on   the  behavioral  and population responses of a resident  member  of  a  community  are not available for mainland new world  frogs.  This  study  is  significant b ecause it is the first to  experimentally  examine the effects of a naturally occurring range expansion of a  congeneric  species on the behavioral, population and demographic  responses  of  a  resident  member of an  anuran  community.  The  immediate  results should be relevant both to predicting  effects  of  invading  species on existing groupings, and  to  elucidating  factors that allow coexistence of species in natural communities.  This  study should be an important contributor to the  fields  of  behavioral   ecology,  herpetology,  and  tropical   conservation  biology.      .",
