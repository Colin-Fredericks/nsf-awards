This  new  technique will extend significantly the range over which  elastic  properties  an be measured and will directly relate the  response  of  the  medium to its internal dynamics. The technique  will  be  exploited to obtain new insight into the origin of the elasticity  in   a  variety  of  disordered,  or  glassy,  'soft'  materials,  including  colloidal  suspensions near  their  glass  transition,  polymer   solutions  and  polymer  melts,  compressed  emulsions,  networks of bio-polymers such as DNA and actin, and slowly  aging  systems.  %%%  The proposed research will develop a novel, laser-based method to  non-invasively  probe essential properties of  a  wide  class  of  materials,  including  gels, and biomolecules  such  as  DNA  and  actin,  a  fibrous molecule that imparts strength to  cells.  The  technique   will  measure  the  mechanical  properties   of   the  materials, thus determining whether their behavior is more 'solid-  like'  (as  in  gelatin) or fluid-like (as in  honey),  and  will  significantly  extend the range of applicability  of  traditional  methods.  The knowledge gained by these studies will provide  new  insight  into underlying origins of the mechanical properties  of  the   materials  investigated..  It  will  also  facilitate   the  application of the materials in commercial or medical areas.  ***",
