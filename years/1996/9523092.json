 "awd_abstract_narration": "9523092  Prevost  Though extensively studied during the last 30 years, the  phenomenon of soil liquefaction is still one of the main causes  of catastrophic damage during major earthquakes.  The aim of this  project is to obtain a better understanding of soil liquefaction  mechanisms, aimed at more realistic liquefaction risk assessment  methods and appropriate seismic design countermeasures, and  emphasizing the importance of spatial variability exhibited by  soil properties.    Natural soils are variable in their properties.  The scarcity of  field test results, and the degree of disorder exhibited by soil  properties, leads to the use of statistical methods to describe  the distribution of those properties.  In this context, the  various geomechanical soil properties are modeled as the  components of a multi-variate, multidimensional (mV-nD)  stochastic field.  The characteristics of the stochastic field  are evaluated based on statistically significant sets of \"in-  situ\" measurement results.  Two- and three-dimensional finite  element simulations of the behavior of horizontally layered sandy  soil, as well as of structures founded on liquefiable soil and  subjected to seismic loads, are performed using the multi-yield  soil constitutive model implemented in the computer code  DYNAFLOW.    The numerical simulation results for predicting excess pore-  pressure buildup, liquefaction index, and liquefaction induced  deformations -- obtained using stochastic input constitutive  parameters -- are compared to deterministic input simulation  results; and the influences on these results of spatial  correlation distances, probability distributions  of soil  properties, cross-correlations between various soil properties,  finite element discretization mesh size, as well as the effects  of the 2-D simplification vs. true 3-D behavior are examined and  quantified.  Verification of the method for constitutive  parameter calibration and for the performance of the analysis  procedure is made by comparison  with \"in-situ\" behavior recorded  during past earthquakes.    Recommendations will be made for updating current analysis and  design procedures for structures founded on liquefiable soils, in  order to account for the degree of spatial variability of soil  properties.  This research will provide a sound basis for  liquefaction risk assessment and for characterization of spatial  variability of soil properties.  ***",
