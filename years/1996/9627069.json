 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent work, Dr. Lynne Walling developed an algebraic proof of  Siegel's representation formula, yielding formulas more explicit  than those of Siegel to describe average representation numbers of  positive definite quadratic forms of even rank and odd level.  She  is currently working with J.L. Hafner, using the theory of  automorphic forms to extend these results to indefinite quadratic  forms, obtaining explicit formulas for the measures of the  representations of the indefinite forms over number fields and over  function fields.  In work with O. Imamoglu, Dr. Walling has defined  a symplectic theta function over a function field and computed the  transformation formula nd will develop some theory of Siegel  modular forms and Jacobi forms in the function field setting.   Information will be gained regarding representations of quadratic  forms by higher dimensional quadratic forms.  She also intends to  extend the techniques developed in work with J. Hoffstein and K.D.  Merrill, explicitly computing the Fourier coefficients of cusp  forms of weights 0 and 1/2 for congruence subgroups that admit only  one-dimensional spaces of cusp forms.    Interactive activities include developing curricula for  college/university mathematics courses based on contemplation,  precise reasoning and clear communication; developing a summer  research institute for women mathematicians; and running a one-week  conference for women in harmonic analysis and number theory.",
