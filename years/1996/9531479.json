 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scientific study of human behavior in organizations relies exclusively on the observation of behavior either under naturally occurring conditions or those that are contrived, conditions that Cronbach labeled as the two disciplines of scientific psychology (Cronbach, 1957; 1975).  While these disciplines differ in their assumptions about the interface between theory and data, they both require that scientific knowledge relevant to human behavior must be based on the observation of actual behaviors.  Recently, the study of behavior has begun to take advantage of knowledge gained from research based on computational or mathematical models and computer simulations in which no actual behaviors of people are involved.  These models/simulations have been found to be quite useful for advancing understanding of large macro-level systems, such as global climate conditions or the nature of organizational structures and other behaviors of the firm.  They have also proved useful for advancing understanding of micro-level systems, in particular, cognitive architectures of problem solving and thinking.  At the level of individuals' behaviors in organizations, the use of such models for aiding understanding of behavior have been rare.  Yet, there are many reasons to believe that computational modeling, mathematical models and computer simulations can be just as valuable at the individual level of behavior as they have been at the more macro- and micro- levels.  This support is for a conference designed to stimulate work in computational models for advancing the understanding of human behavior in work organizations.  The stimulation of interest will be accomplished by attracting high quality participants to the conference, conducting the conference in a manner designed to stimulate the creation of quality papers, and also by actively recruiting and supporting the attendance of young scholars in the field.  This conference is being jointly funded with the American Psychological Association and the Office of Naval Research.                                                            +   _                      \u00db\u00aa\u2593\u00a0\u00d1Oh \u00aa'  +'\u00aa\u25920   +            +     S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (   ++++++++++++                                    /   \u2580                                                                           ++++++++++++                                                                                                                    ++++++++++++                                                                                                                    ++++++++++++                                                    ]               $       H        l       +       \u00a2       \u2557                       D       h                                                   R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                        robin cantor                         robin cantor                @     O\u00bcS +                         @    -+Y+\u00aa)                         @    \u00aaa\u2017k7+                                                                                                 @    v(A                                    Microsoft Word 6.0                                                      2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ]\u00aae =-      e                   i                                                           j       j   j       j       j       j       j       `       `       `       `       `       `       n       `       \u00bb   1   \u255d       \u255d       \u255d       \u255d       \u255d       \u255d       \u255d       \u255d       f       e       e       e       \u00a0   =   \u00bd   =   \u00aa       \u2500   T   =   ,   \u00bb                       j       \u255d                 \u255d       \u255d                       \u255d       \u255d       \u00bb       \u255d       j       j       \u255d                       \u255d       \u255d       \u255d       \u255d       \u255d       j       \u255d       j       \u255d       f                               +       j       j       j       j       \u255d       f       \u255d   (   \u255d",
