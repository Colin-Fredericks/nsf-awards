 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Puget Sound, located in Tacoma Washington, is the recipient of funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program.  The award will be used to modernize biology  research laboratories in the 1967 Thompson Hall Science Building. Being the largest of the laboratory science departments at the institution, Biology faculty research is closely associated with mentoring student research. Research and research training, areas currently devoted to support plant ecology, marine phycology, molecular systematics, population biology, molecular biology and neurobiology, will be renovated.  Specific renovations will include: reconfiguring rooms to provide more flexible space; installation of fume hoods,  laboratory casework and benches; and updating utility systems. Faculty conducting molecular and physiological work will have appropriate bench space, support rooms, and storage facilities. Every individual will have the opportunity to participate in the scientific enterprise, and therefore laboratories will be accessible to physically challenged persons by providing low-bench and high-bench working spaces.  This project will enable all faculty to conduct year-round, unrestricted research where several students can work on senior thesis projects with faculty.  Expanding the breath of investigative training for the Department's increasing population of majors will expose students to the kinds of research that will encourage them to pursue graduate or advance technical training in science.",
