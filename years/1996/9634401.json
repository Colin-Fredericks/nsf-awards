 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN:  9634401  PI:  Hiromoto      Specific functional areas of the brain can contain 100,000 to 1   million neurons.  When trying to model functional aspects of these   neural networks it is critically important that the model is of a   sufficiently large scale (greater than 1,000 neurons) to examine   emergent properties of the network.  Large-scale biophysical neural   networks on the order of 10,000 neurons require efficient   computational resources that are beyond the normal scope of single   high-speed computer workstations.  Advances in interprocessor   communications and algorithms for computing large-scale problems now   permit us to apply these methods to neurophysiological questions. In   this work, we intend to develop tools that can be used to investigate   how networks of biophysical models of neurons behave based on known   anatomical connectivity, cellular neurophysiology, and rules for   synaptic plasticity.    Our project has two specific aims.  First, we will develop algorithms   and supporting software that exploit the inherent properties of   parallel computational architectures for simulating the synchronous   activity of neuron models interconnected by synapses that undergo   activity-dependent changes in strength. Such changes may accompany   learning. The simulator developed here will be user-modifiable at many   levels allowing for the study of different brain regions having varied   anatomical and physiological characteristics.  Second, graphic   visualization tools will be developed to better study and analyze the   large amounts of data produced by the large-scale neural  simulations. These will include methods to examine the states of   individual neurons as well as the correlated activity of different   neurons within the network.",
