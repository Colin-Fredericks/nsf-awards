Phosphors  are luminescent materials when excited by an energy source  such as an electron beam or photons and are composed of an  inert host lattice with a small amount of dopant  (activator).  Most of the commercially available emissive  display phosphors have been developed for high voltage,  cathode ray tube applications which operate at 10-30 keV.  There has been very little work done on developing new  compositions for low voltage (100-10,000 eV) or plasma  displays (UV emission at 147 nm).  These new applications  have demands on phosphors that are not optimized or met by  the existing compositions.  This project is to build a multipurpose workstation for the  evaluation of cathodoluminescent and photoluminescent  materials for applications in CRT screens, field emission  devices and plasma displays.  The workstation will consist  of vacuum pumps, a vacuum chamber, a mass spectrometer, and  a spectroradiometer with associated electronics for the  evaluation of low and medium voltage cathodoluminescent  phosphors.  The UV evaluation will be performed by a  commercially available luminescence spectrophotometer.  %%%  Our research has focused on the synthesis of novel phosphor  powder compositions, the deposition of the powders to form  highly adherent, dense screens and the characterization of  the luminescent properties of these screens.  We have  concentrated our attention on understanding, modeling and  predicting the luminescent behavior to ultimately improve  the brightness, efficiency, and to decrease the emission  decay time of high voltage phosphor screens.  However, the  role of surfaces (point and line defects, absorbed species,  morphology, grain boundaries, etc.) is not understood on a  fundamental level.  Comparing the luminescent  behavior of  single crystals, powder screen and thin film phosphors will  yield basic information on the how photoemission is affected  by surfaces which in turn will aid in optimizing phosphor  screens for display applications.  ***",
