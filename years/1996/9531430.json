 "awd_abstract_narration": "9531430  Mermin  This grant continues on the well recognized work of the PI  on the generalization of  symmetry classification (of  periodic crystals) to include aperiodic crystals.  Some  specific items include the case of tensorial order  parameter, symmetry changes at commensurate-incommensurate  phase transition and the newly discovered tetrahedral  quasicrystals.  In addition, there are questions of the  relationship between the recent work in the mathematical  literature by Novikov, Piunikhin and Conway and the PI's  classification scheme.  %%%  Until the discovery of quasicrystals in the early eighties,  the scientific view of a periodic crystal had been well  established for more than 100 years and had been described  in the textbooks.  The aperiodic or quasiperiodic structures  challenged that framework and, in a seminal work by the PI,  the symmetry classification has been generalized to include  the new developments.  The present grant further explores  ways of enriching the new classification scheme.  There are  also plans to study and establish relationships with the  work of others.  ***",
