 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore the use of advanced electromagnetic suspension and actuation technology to improve silicon wafer handling during Rapid Thermal Processing (RTP).  Current wafer RTP processing incurs substantial cost from lost wafers and facility downtime due to ball bearing failure and wear.  In addition to improved RTP equipment, manufacturers of wafer processing equipment need advanced facilities, which will make rolling element bearing technology obsolescent.  Advances are expected in higher rotation rates and larger diameter wafers.  Magnetic suspension and actuation technology looks promising for supporting and rotating a wafer in the high temperature corrosive atmosphere (fluorine, chlorine, HCl) used in RTP.       Phase I will combine design, analysis, prototype testing, and cost/per-formance trade-offs to demonstrate feasibility and to produce a cost competitive conceptual design for an integrated motoring and magnetic suspension system (IMMSS) for RTP facilities.  A prototype would be evaluated Phase II.  Magnetic suspension and actuation technology is ultimately applicable to a wide range of material handling problems in integrated circuit manufacture which require precise positioning; the absence of stiction; the absence of wear particle generation; and exposure to vacuum, corrosive, or high temperature environments.",
