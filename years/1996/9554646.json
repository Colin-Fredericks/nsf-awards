 "awd_abstract_narration": "Starting in each of June of 1996 and 1997, this Undergraduate  Faculty Enhancement project will bring 32 faculty members from  other schools to Mount Holyoke College for a one week workshop and  to a two day follow-up meeting preceding the joint mathematical  meetings 18 months later. The project will disseminate materials  and methods from the course, Laboratory in Mathematical  Experimentation, which was developed at Mount Holyoke with NSF  support.  Exploration of the course materials will introduce  participants to the interactive, conversational mode of mathematics  teaching that the course requires.  Participants will also explore  the opportunities the laboratory course affords for dramatically  restructuring the undergraduate mathematics major in ways that  enhance student understandine.  The June workshops will have five  elements.  First, participants will model the learning experience  of students in the Lab by actually carrying out computer  experimentation.  Second, the workshop instructors will model the  role of the teacher as coach.  Third, by looking at student papers,  participants will both address issues of teaching and evaluating  writing and also have a means of examining some of the ways  students' thinking develops.  Fourth, participants will have an  opportunity to talk with students who have taken the Lab.  Finally,  participants will discuss their observations and experiences and  compare them among themselves.  These elements will allow  participants not only to deepen their understanding of the  mathematical and pedagogical issues but also to begin to imagine  themselves teaching in new ways.  The January follow-up workshop  will be devoted to implementation issues, evaluation, and a study  of strategies for opening the mathematics curriculum.",
