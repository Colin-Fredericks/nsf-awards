The objectives of this research  are fourfold: (1) one aim is to determine the anisotropy of  the bonding charge densities in titanium aluminide (TiAl)  and assess its influence on deformation processes.  Accurate  values of the Debye-Waller factors are determined on  standard samples of known compositions using four-circle x-  ray diffraction.  Subsequently, low-order structure factors  for TiAl are deduced from which the anisotropy of bonding  charge densities are assessed.  The possible influence of  the resulting charge densities on deformation mechanisms are  then assessed.  (2) the effects of both substitutional and  interstitial solute additions on dislocation mobilities are  determined.  Here, experiments are performed on single phase  samples of TiAl to develop an understanding of the  interaction between oxygen impurities and dislocations in  TiAl.  (3) an assessment of the role of Ti3Al on the  deformation behavior and micro-mechanisms of fracture in  TiAl-based systems is made.  The deformation behavior of  Ti3Al in lamellar, equiaxed and duplex versions of the  microstructures is determined by post-mortem transmission  electron microscopy (TEM) studies, with particular emphasis  being placed on slip transmission through Ti3Al, and the  accumulation of strain at interfaces between TiAl and Ti3Al.  (4) the ability to engineer interface properties in TiAl-  based systems by solute addition, in an analogous manner to  that in Ni-base superalloys, is investigated.  %%%  The research examines deformation mechanisms in titanium  aluminide alloys, whose practical applications are limited  by a lack of understanding of a number of important factors  related to their mechanical behavior.  The effort also  contributes to the scientific base for elevated temperature  interme tallic compounds.  ***",
