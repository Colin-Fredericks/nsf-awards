 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to modernize the undergraduate mathematics curriculum through the use of a computational laboratory and the development of related course materials. The main goal is to integrate modern computation into mathematics instruction, both as course content and as a method of instruction. Computation is revolutionizing the way science and engineering are practiced. The new curriculum is intended to produce students (both majors and nonmajors) more attuned to current developments.   Preliminary efforts to introduce computational content and delivery have been successful and have generated ideas for further development. Input has come from unusually close contacts with science and engineering colleagues. This interaction is crucial to integrating mathematics with related coursework. The curriculum changes are completely compatible and highly correlated with parallel developments in the School of Information Technology and Engineering. Indeed, reform of the lower-division mathematics courses is a critical part of that program. The positive interaction of mathematics and engineering creates opportunities for mutual enhancement of efforts and provides special sharing of resources. As part of the development for upper-division applied math, the project can explore the teaming of math students with engineers in senior design projects. Links with the Mathematics Across the Curriculum initiative are also being pursued.   A modern X-window computer laboratory can deepen students' understanding of mathematics by permitting use of high-end tools and applications. It also opens new possibilities for cooperative and interactive learning through the use of graphical interfaces and interactive Web material, while preparing students for careers in industry or academia.",
