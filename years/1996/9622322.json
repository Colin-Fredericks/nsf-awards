The overall goal of this project is  to work with middle school students, their parents, and their science teachers to increase the  number of students with disabilities that pursue science, engineering, and mathematics career  fields.  The specific goals of the project are to: 1) stimulate student interest in science,  engineering, and mathematics; 2) heighten the awareness among middle school students, their  families, and their science teachers of the opportunities for persons with disabilities in these  fields; and 3) provide them with an understanding of the importance of career exploration  and taking appropriate college preparatory courses in high school.    Students often begin to make career preparation decisions in the middle school grades as they  prepare to enter high school where college preparatory electives require decisions in earlier  grades.  This is especially true in science and math where a sequence of courses must be  followed from the earliest possible grade level.  Students with disabilities and their parents  need to be prepared for these decisions and to realize that these choices will influence  subsequent educational and career development activities.  For students with disabilities,  neglecting fundamental skills may exclude them from the opportunity to enroll or succeed in  SEM curricula when they enter college.    Primary components of the proposed project are:  (1) As sistive Technology and Careers in  SEM Workshops, (2) Adapted Classroom and Student Science Kits, (3) Teacher Awareness  Seminars, (4) Study and Career Guidance Mentoring Program, (5) Super Summer of Science  Showcases.    A unique feature of this proposal is its focus on middle school students with disabilities, their  parents, and their teachers.  For the purposes of this proposal, middle school grades will  include grades six through nine.  Through the mentoring and counseling program, the project  will address the educational transition from late elementary school through high school.  The  project would provide training for middle-school teachers in methods of including students  with disabilities in all aspects of classroom and laboratory learning experiences.  Activities  designed to stimulate students with disabilities to explore science projects and courses would  be undertaken and evaluated.  Information regarding available assistive technologies that  make SEM activities accessible to students with disabilities would be provided to science  teachers, students, and parents.  ***",
