One major objective  of the research is to demonstrate how the local analysis of  robustness can be used in the global analysis of essentially  nonlinear feedback systems, to produce results not matched by any  other approach.  Another general objective is to propose new  solutions, and analyze the known \"ad-hoc\" solution to several  well-known nonlinear feedback problems.    Analysis of relay feedback systems.  Feedback interconnection of  a relay feedback with a linear time-variant plant will be  considered.  The situation in which such interconnection induces  self-oscillation (a limit cycle) will be of most interest.   Sufficient conditions for the global stability of such limit  cycles will be derived, and the sensitivity of the oscillations  in the presence of external inputs will be estimated.  In  particular, analysis of relay-based self-tunning of PID feedback  will be done.  Another application will be the analysis of delta-  sigma modulators.  In general, this part of the research project  is aimed to compensate for the lack of methods suitable for  rigorous analysis of piecewise linear systems.    Feedback control with magnitude and rate constraints.  The  problem of control of linear and mildly nonlinear systems with  constraints imposed on control signal rate and magnitude will be  considered.  The prime objective will be to improve the speed and  efficiency of the control response, expressed in terms of induced  norms and other parameters characterizing the transient behavior.  Another objective is to provide a rigorous basis for a  comparative study of different anti-reset windup designs.    Feedback control of computer animation.  This part of the project  involves research on the feasibility of real-time dynamically  simulate d computer animation of an open-loop unstable object.   The \"object\" will be a three-dimensional system on joints,  normally having at any time one or two joint ends touching the  ground, and maintaining stability by changing the angles between  the joints in a coordinated manner.  Ultimately, the object will  have most of the dynamical features of a human body, through the  initial models will have less degrees of freedom.  The goal is to  teach the object to \"walk\" in the presence of the gravity force.   It is most likely that the stability of the human body motion is  ensured by several feedback loops governed by the autonomic  nervous system.  However, the actual control laws defining these  feedbacks are not known.  The main objective of the proposed  research is to show that, using an advanced nonlinear feedback  control methodology, it is possible to find algorithms for real-  time stabilization of the open-loop locomotion, at least in the  case of a simplified model.  The research will also be aimed at  studying the algorithms for stabilization of repetitive open-loop  unstable motion.    Integrated educational software.  The educational component of  the proposal is aimed at the development of an integrated  software package and special methodology for the undergraduate  class in \"Systems and signals\", to provide a tool for state-of-  the-art, learning based, and practice-oriented education.  The  system will provide    (a) computer-assisted multimedia-based presentations of course  concepts;    (b) student self-training using random generators of drill  problems;    (c) automatic problem generation and evaluation programs for  official testing;    (d) an open architecture allowing further accumulation of the  knowledge.    Ultimately, the proposed development should facilitate a major  change in the forms of the university education.  ***",
