It has been evaluated as a study of the reform of mathematics.  The purpose of this project is to document the impact of a particular effort to reform mathematics curriculum (Mathematics in Context) for grades 5 to 8 on the mathematical performance of students.  The project will examine changes in student performance over time and compare their results with similar students in different programs.  A four-year longitudinal study with comparative features will be conducted in four schools in three urban school districts and three districts.  The sites will be chosen site will use the Mathematics in Context curriculum and two will use a traditional curriculum. Indicator of the variables that will yield information about the teaching of the curriculum and its impact on student performance.  the study will produce technical reports, and articles to inform educators, policy makers, and parents.",
