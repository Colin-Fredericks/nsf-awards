 "awd_abstract_narration": "Students choosing to major in biology at this college can choose from two microbiology courses, Microbiology, and Medical Microbiology. Increases in student enrollments in biology, along with increased student interest in cooperative research, have lead to pressure to expand the biology offerings. The decision was made to increase the depth of treatment of the topics covered formerly by the Medical Microbiology course by dividing it into two courses, Immunology and Medical Microbiology. The former course treats the host response to pathogenicity, while the latter surveys major bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens.   The immunology course has been assembled and was offered in the Spring 1995 semester using borrowed equipment.  Now, with the acquisition of new equipment, the department is able to extend and improve the laboratory exercises.  The new equipment includes a microscope with fluorescence capabilities, a 96-well microplate reader, and equipment to culture, manipulate, and quantitate cells of the immune system.   The Biology Department faculty believe that majors learn best when offered the opportunity to conduct research as a means to enhance their classroom knowledge.  The equipment obtained can also be used in faculty-directed student independent research.",
