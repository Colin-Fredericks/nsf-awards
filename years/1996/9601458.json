 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, complex biological problems are        increasingly analyzed using computer simulation models.        Unfortunately, the development and application of these        simulations are too often beyond the reach of experimental        biologists, most of whom have neither the background nor        the time to devote to mastering conventional simulation        tools. This proposal addresses the problem of making        simulation accessible to biological scientists. Software        development is proposed that is intuitive, easily        accessible to the novice within a few hours, and        sufficiently powerful to develop innovative, state of the        art simulations. The objective is to provide the tools for        both researchers and students of biology that will be:                     1. Designed specifically to handle biological             problems.                          2. Intuitive and easy to learn and use by scientists                            with limited                 mathematical or computer experience.                          3. Sufficiently flexible to handle a wide variety of                            problems.                           4. Sufficiently powerful to tackle current problems  in the research                   literature.                5. Sufficiently flexible to allow teachers to design  their own simulation                       exercises and interfaces according to their  own experience and tastes.          These objectives will be accomplished with software that        contains an intuitive graphical interface designed        specifically for constructing biological models and solving        them very quickly. It will also contain a convenient output        display that is conducive to exploring model parameters,        curve fitting model results to empirical data, and plotting        results in different modes (e.g. run time, batch, overlay,        strip chart, triggered oscilloscope, 2 or 3 dimensions,        phase p lane, iso- and nullclines). The software will        contain modern algorithms for solving stiff systems of        ordinary differential and difference equations, initial and        boundary value problems, partial differential equations,        root finders, location of bifurcations, optimization, and        stochastic problems. In many cases these mathematical        techniques will be invisible to the inexperienced user, but        will be available to the more advanced worker.",
