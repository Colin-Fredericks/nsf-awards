The  equipment will be used for two research projects based on  high resolution photoelectron spectroscopy.  In one, the  atomic structure of surfaces will be studied using the  techniques of photoelectron diffraction, extended  photoemission fine structure spectroscopy, and photoelectron  holography.  These techniques provide information about the  symmetry and geometrical arrangement of surface atoms, and  are powerful tools for investigating the atomistics of  surface chemical reactions and film growth.  In the other  project, quantum layer structures, including single and  multiple quantum wells and superlattices, will be studies.  The goal is to understand the electronic effects associated  with quantum confinement, coupling, interface scattering and  crystal potential modulation.  Spin polarization and  magnetic effects in these quantum structures will be  investigated.  This analyzer will be used in conjunction  with the new undulator sources that are under construction  at the Synchrotron Radiation Center (Stoughton, Wisconsin)  and the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National  Laboratory).",
