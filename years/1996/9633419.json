 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop a semantic  foundation for semantic composition and interoperation of  heterogeneous components of open systems. Composition and  interoperation occur at many levels (requirements,  specification, code, executables) and along multiple  dimensions (functionality, reliability, security,  availability). Relations among the various levels and  dimensions must be preserved.  Existing work on composition  and interoperation has largely focused on syntactic  structure. It is essential to develop a semantic basis in  order to provide for safe, secure, and  meaningful  combinations. Semantic structuring of complex systems should  provide a firm basis for determining what parts are  interchangeable under given conditions, and to predict  effects of changes: of components on the whole, and of  system requirements on requirements for the parts. There is  a wide range of applications where such a semantic  foundation for interoperation can be of value.  It is  especially important in applications that combine components  from diverse domains such as: data bases, spread sheets,  knowledge bases, multi-media, mobile-agents, control theory,  or event-based simulations.    Metalogical methods from the theory of general logics, and  associated techniques of mappings in and across formalisms,  are used to achieve formalism-independent semantics for  system composition. This supports the multi-dimensionality  of a system's levels of description and formalization.  Techniques from the theory of Open Mechanized Reasoning  Systems (OMRS) as well as work on the formal semantics of  actor systems are used to study interoperation aspects.  Reflective techniques, particularly reflective logics and  multi-model systems are employed extensively. This research  is expected to lead to a new technology for composition,  interoperation and dynamic evolution of software systems.  It seeks to treat interoperability at many levels and along  many dimensions: components, languages, speci fications,  formalisms/logics, and tools. This provides the capacity to  move in a mathematically rigorous way across the different  formalizations of a system, and to use the different tools  supporting these formalizations  in a rigorously integrated  way. The research is based on two key technical ideas:  module calculi (for integration) and open multi-model  systems (for interoperation). The module calculus is  formalism-independent, and is intended to have powerful new  operations such as generalization. Open multi-model systems  formalize the multidimensional aspects of independent  interoperating parts.  ***",
