 "awd_abstract_narration": "9553140  O'Shea  Yeast growth is sustained by the availability of nutrients.  Phosphate is a required nutrient.  When phosphate is limiting transcription of an acid phosphatase occurs.  This enzyme which is secreted hydrolyzes phosphoryl groups of organic molecules to yield phosphate ion.  The PHO5 gene encodes the phosphatase; transcription is tightly repressed when yeast are grown in medium containing Pi.  Three positive regulators and two negative regulators of the gene have been identified.  Two of the positive regulators have been shown to be transcriptional regulators that bind to the promoter.  Both of the negative regulators are essential; deletion of either results in high levels of gene expression.   One of these, PHO80, is homologous to a yeast cyclin (which regulates cell division).  The other negative regulator, PHO85, is a CDC related protein kinase.  The complex of negative regulators phosphorylates transcription factor PHO4 only when yeast are grown in high phosphate.  This phosphorylation is correlated with gene repression.  Growth in low Pi results in one of the positive regulators, PHO81, inhibiting the kinase complex.  The reduced activity of the kinase is correlated with derepression of the gene; this is assisted by the action of PHO4 whose biochemical activity is not characterized.  %%%  Yeast require phosphate to grow and multiply.  When phosphate amounts are low the yeast secrete a special enzyme that breaks down organic compounds that contain phosphate to renew the supplies.  The investigator has found that the same molecules that regulate the production of the special enzyme also regulate cell division.  This is a remarkable example of  adaptation to the environment.  The use of the same or similar molecules that control phosphate use which is necessary for growth and division also direct the cell to reproduce itself.  ***",
