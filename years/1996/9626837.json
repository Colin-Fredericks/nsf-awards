 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is to achieve direct alkynylation and   olefination of secondary and tertiary C-H bonds via the use of alkynyl   and vinyl triflones.  The research will attempt to define the mechanism   of the reaction, to develop enthalpy-matched reagents for regiospecific   alkynylation of complex substrates, to define appropriate protecting   groups to enable selective alkynylation of unactivated tertiary C-H bonds   in the presence of typically more reactive functional groups, to examine   the reactions of functionalized alkynyl triflones, to use optically   active acetals for the enantiospecific synthesis of acetylenic 1,3- and   1,2-diols, to seek seek alternate reagents for low temperature initiation   of the alkynylation reaction, to use the reaction to induce radical   cyclizations and fragmentations and to broaden the scope of the reaction   to include radical-mediated olefination, dienylation, allenylation and   allylation.  With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting   the research of Dr. Philip L. Fuchs of the Department of Chemistry at   Purdue University.  Professor Fuchs will focus his work on developing   methodology by which to transform C-H bonds into C-C bonds.   Such   methodology, relying on reagents known as triflones, would provide   synthetic chemists with a powerful tool with which to modify organic   molecules.",
