 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor E. James Davis and graduate  students of the University of Washington to collaborate in  their research in aerosol chemistry with Professor Gustav  Schweiger of the Ruhr University of Bochum, Germany.  They  share an interest in chemical reactions in aerosols which  are associated with atmospheric pollution and ozone  depletion.  Professor Davis has unique facilities featuring  the coupling of electrodynamic balances with Raman  spectroscopy, which are particularly well suited for the  study of relatively slow gas/aerosol chemical reactions.  Professor Schweiger has developed unique facilities which  combine the vibrating orifice drop generator with Raman  instruments, an approach which is well-suited to the study  of rapid reactions. Joining of their complementary expertise  and facilities will be mutually beneficial.  Microparticles play an important role in atmospheric  phenomena. Condensation nuclei affect cloud microphysics,  and nucleation and growth phenomena dominate cloud physics.  In addition to their chemical role, microdroplets can serve  as optical cavities, and resonances arise from interference  of the internally reflected and refracted light, which  complicate analytical inferences.  This collaboration  addresses the interaction between elastic and inelastic  (Raman) scattering which is unique to microdroplets, and how  this interaction affects measurement of chemical reactions  of particular significance in atmospheric chemistry.",
