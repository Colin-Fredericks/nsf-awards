 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern  whole brain cryosection and digitization techniques coupled  to  modern  tissue section and staining methods allow anatomists to provide  exquisitely  detailed  in  vivo information  regarding  the  anatomical  structure  and function of individual brains.  The difficulty  lies  in  two  areas:  images  and  sections within  the  same  anatomy  must  be  registered.  But  more  fundamentally,  even  when  registered,  normal  variation  across disparate anatomes makes pooling of inter  anatomical  data  difficult, if not impossible. In this proposal, we strive towards  the  development of algorithmic tools for the fusion of anatomical  and  functional   data  as  measured  via  gross  whole  brain  cryosections  (0.05-0.1  mm  resolution) and stained tissue sections in  the  macaque  monkey brain.    The major focus of this proposal is on the development of _ as manifest  in  the  adult macaque, allowing for the mapping of a single  atlas  to  multiple  individual  targets. The atlas  contains  all  subvolumes  of  biological  significance to the investigator in our  work  these  would  include  the  sulci  and  gyri, deep thalamic  nuclei,  ventricles  and  various  sub  areas  in  the occipital lobe, including  primary  visual  cortex (area V1) and other visual areas. Our representations provide  a  tool  for  the  algorithmic generation of smooth maps (maps  preserving  differential   geometric  lengths,  areas,  volumes)  from   an   atlas  (template)  and  its subvolumes to a family of target anatomies.  These  maps  allow  for  the fusion and pooling of geometric  and  physiologic  information  from  varied  experimental preparations  into  one  common  coordinate system or data base.    As   part  of  such  a  representation  of  normal  macaque  anatomical  variability, a probabilistic measure will be constructed from a  family  of  representative  macaque  whole  brain  anatomies.  The  probability  measures normal anatomical variation in act ual brain anatomy. This will  provide  neuroanatomists with a direct tool for placing  their  samples  into  a common coordinate system with a precise degree of certainty  or  confidence. Such a measure of anatomical variability reflects both  the  underlying stability of pre-defined anatomically labeled regions,  i.e.  subareas  and  volumes such as sulci, eyri, and different visual  areas  and  their  covariation  relative to a single  biologically  meaningful  coordinate system.",
