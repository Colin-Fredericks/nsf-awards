 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerous studies have found that the level of perceived risk is higher for women than for men, across a wide range of hazards.  Many explanations for this finding have been proposed, focusing upon biological factors, socialization, and differences in knowledge about risk.  A recent study by Flynn, Slovic, and Mertz found, however, that the difference between men and women was primarily due to white males, who exhibited very low levels of perceived risk.  Among persons who were not white, there was no difference between men and women.  Moreover, nonwhite persons held perceptions of risk that were similar to those of white women.  These results and other findings lead Flynn et al. to hypothesize that sociopolitical factors such as status, power, alienation, and trust play a major role in perception and acceptance of risks.  The present research tests this hypothesis.   The research plan includes the development of a survey instrument designed to assess sociopolitical constructs such as power, control, influence, alienation, social class, and trust, along with other variables predictive of risk perceptions (such as worldviews).  Demographic information pertaining to race, gender, age, occupation and income will also be obtained.  Respondents will be members of targeted groups varying on race, gender, and social status.  Standard multivariate analyses and structural modeling will be used to determine the extent to which the effects of race and gender on risk perception can be explained by the sociopolitical constructs measured in the survey.   Finding that sociopolitical factors play a major role in determining perception and acceptance of societal risk would have enormous implications for risk communication and risk management.  On the communication side, it would indicate why traditional approaches based on translating and disseminating technical information have had so little success.   No form of message `framing` is likely to overcome alienation and distrust.   On the management side, a number of recent proposals have called for better technical risk assessment and expert oversight as the key to conflict reduction and better risk management.  However, conflicts due to incompatible values, pervasive distrust, alienation, and other social and political factors would be unlikely to be reduced by technical analysis.  Trying to address such risk controversies with more science, in fact, would be likely to exacerbate conflict.",
