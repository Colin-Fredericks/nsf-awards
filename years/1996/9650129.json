 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides a seamless interface between the classroom and laboratory experiences in Software Design and Implementation, the second Computer Science course in this department's curriculum. This integration is done through the design of a combined classroom and laboratory that contains 10 computer workstations. These facilities provide an ideal environment for cooperative and collaborative learning experiences facilitated by the latest computer equipment. The students also learn to develop software in a modern environment and have access to that environment throughout the time of class instruction. The facilities also provide projection equipment to make the work being done by any student visible to the rest of the class. This laboratory classroom enables the development of activities that combine lecture, discussion, group work. and laboratory work, all within a single class period.   The results of this project are a set of exercises and activities designed to utilize this concept. The success of this concept can be assessed and the result may be disseminated over the Internet and World Wide Web, conference presentations, and papers.",
