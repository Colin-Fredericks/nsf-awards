His  collaborator will be Dr. Raymond Meyer Hoff,  of the  Atmospheric Environment Service (AES) of Canada.  The main  objective is to develop a multi-element data set on air  samples collected by the U.S.-Canada Integrated Atmospheric  Deposition Network (IADN).  The IADN has stations on site on  each of the Great Lakes to provide an estimate of overall  regional inputs of toxic materials, including trace metals,  from the atmosphere to the Lakes.  A program of chemical  analysis and receptor modeling is proposed in which samples  obtained at the IADN sites will be used to estimate the  sources and source/regions of trace elements deposition in  the Great Lakes, and the effects of specific urban areas on  the airborne particulate matter compositions.    The atmospheric concentrations of many toxic trace elements  in the Great Lakes area has risen dramatically in recent  decades to the point where they pose a potential threat to  public health and the environment.  Atmospheric deposition  of toxic materials downwind from large urban areas is a  potentially important input to the Lakes which has not been  addressed by the IADN.  The proposed research will directly  address this problem through a source-receptor modeling  program for particle-size distribution.  ***",
