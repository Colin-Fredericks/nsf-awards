The widespread presence of males in most populations has  been intriguing evolutionary biologists for decades, since  there are many potential disadvantages in requiring two  individuals to come together in order to reproduce.  First  there is the time and energy needed to locate and identify  an individual of the same species but opposite sex.  Also,  natural selection favors any activity that results in more  of an individual s genes getting into the next generation.  Thus, if an individual develops a means of producing  offspring without having to share half of its genes with a  partner, that individual immediately adds twice as many of  its own genes to the next generation.  Some plants and  animals have, in fact, evolved means to reproduce with a  single parent, either by parthenogenesis (direct development  of offspring from an unfertilized egg) or by producing both  eggs and sperm within a single individual (called a  hermaphrodite) and fertilizing their eggs with their own  sperm.  Why, evolutionary biologists have asked, do the  overwhelming number of organisms still reproduce with two  parents?  Several possible mathematical solutions (called   models ) have been suggested by theoreticians, but few of  them have been experimentally tested, especially in animal  systems.  We will test one of the proposed models by utilizing an  animal species with a recently discovered unusual mating  system in which some individuals are hermaphrodites and  others are males.  No females are found.  Hermaphrodites can  fertilize their eggs with their own sperm or have their eggs  fertilized by males.  That is, they can reproduce with or  without a partner.  Hermaphrodites can not, however,  fertilize the eggs of other hermaphrodites.  This unusual  animal is the clam shrimp,  Eulimnadia texana , a small  crustacean found in te mporary pools throughout the  southwestern U.S.  Males are found in lower proportions than  hermaphrodites but appear to be present in almost all  populations.  This is called a  mixed mating system  since  reproduction can occur by the typical means of two  individuals mating (male with a hermaphrodite) or by a  single individual (a hermaphrodite) fertilizing its own  eggs.  Early models of mating system evolution, however,  predicted that only one or the other type of mating system  would evolve and be maintained over long periods of time,  not both.  Nevertheless, more recent models have suggested  that a mixed system, in which both forms of reproduction are  present, could, under appropriate conditions, be stable over  long periods of time.  It is our goal to experimentally test  these more recent models to document whether these  conditions hold in these shrimp.  By studying an animal with  a mixed mating system we can learn what the advantages and  the disadvantages are for individuals that reproduce by  themselves and for those that reproduce with a partner.  Recently, Otto, et al. (1993) developed a mathematical model  aimed at explaining why the mixed mating system of  E.  texana  appears to be stable over a long period of time.  In  order to test the validity of the model, it is necessary to  learn more about the natural history and genetics of this  species.  In particular we need to collect data on four  aspects of the biology of clam shrimp that are required by  the model.  We have thus decided to begin our exploration of  the stable mixed mating system of  Eulimnadia texana  by  quantifying those four aspects of the biology of clam  shrimp.  A combination of behavioral observations/manipulations and  genetic crossings will be used to learn about these four  aspects of the biology of clam shrimp under a range of semi-  natural and controlled environmental conditions.  These  behavioral and genetic data can then be used to determine  how accurate the Otto, et al.(1993) model is and/o r how it  will be necessary to modify the model to produce a truer  picture of the evolution of this mixed mating system.  By studying the life history, genetics and reproductive  biology of an animal with a mixed mating system, we will  gain a better understanding of how a few species have  managed to persist in the absence of males and, more  importantly, why most species have maintained a reproductive  system requiring two parents, in spite of the costs of doing  so.",
