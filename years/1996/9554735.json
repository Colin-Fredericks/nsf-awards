 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chautauqua program provides an annual series of workshops in  which scholars at the frontiers of various sciences and engineering  meet intensively for several days with undergraduate college  science teachers.  These workshops provide an opportunity for  invited scholars to communicate new knowledge, concepts, and  techniques directly to college teachers in ways which are  immediately beneficial to their teaching.  The primary aim is to  enable undergraduate teachers in the sciences to keep current and  relevant.  This program is national in scope and will immediately  benefit large numbers of college faculty (7,500 participants over  three years) who in turn positively influence more than 1,000,000  undergraduates.  This program which has impact on the quality of  undergraduate programs in both two- and four-year institutions is  an essential element in attracting and maintaining an adequate  supply of graduates in science, mathematics and engineering.  The  program follows the recommendation of the National Science Board  that the Foundation use highly leveraged program support to address  the serious national problems in undergraduate education.  The  project is 1/3 supported by NSF.",
