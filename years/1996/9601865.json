 "awd_abstract_narration": "9601865  Polla  This Academic Research Infrastructure award provides funding for research equipment in the area of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and general microelectronics at the University of Minnesota.  The capital equipment to be acquired includes a photolithography aligner, a thin film deposition system, a reactive-ion etching machine, and computer controls for semiconductor furnaces.  The equipment will be acquired to support new research opportunities in sensors, actuators, electronics, and optoelectronic devices.  The specific aim of this research is to develop smart electronic systems on a silicon chip that can sense physical, chemical, and biological variables; process the resulting signals in real-time with on-chip electronic circuits; and actively do responsive work based on currently sensed conditions.  Applications include biomedical analysis and surgery, environmental monitoring, industrial process control, and safety monitoring devices such as those used for automotive air-bag deployment.  For example in one application, MEMS devices will be designed to sense human tissue properties during surgery, interpret these inputs, and guide a surgeon to remove only the intended tissue while leaving healthy tissue unaffected, thus providing minimal tissue disruption, improved safety, and a better outcome for the patient.    The equipment to be acquired in this program will help in the education and training of approximately 130 graduate students in 11 academic disciplines carrying out graduate research in MEMS, microelectronics, and integrated circuits at the University of Minnesota and other midwest universities.  It will also provide an opportunity for approximately 50 undergraduate students to learn about MEMS and microelectronics.  These educational aspects are vital to maintaining a highly-trained and innovative U.S. high technology workforce.",
