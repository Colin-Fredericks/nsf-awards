Governmental, educational, health services, and private employers in the Four Corners region will be surveyed to assess current and projected needs for information science employees.  Survey results will be presented to high school and college information science educators and employers at a Tsaile meeting.  The CS and CIS programs at Navajo Community College will be modified and expanded - based on survey findings, recommendations from the meeting, and ACM suggested curricula for two-year programs in computing - to better prepare Navajo students for further education or to find employment in the information industry.    The project is significant for several reasons, such as:     - including the first survey of information science employment ever done in this area;     - establishing communications among high school and college computing educators, and         employers that do not currently exist; and     - enhancing students' educational and employment prospects",
