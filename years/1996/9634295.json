 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will analyze the process of translating scientific data into the formation and execution of environmental policies. It takes the socio-political responses and management of Chilean fisheries as a case study from which to extract more general relationships of human adaptations to climate change.  As a result of the increase in the accuracy of predictive capabilities and the wider distribution of probabilistic forecast efforts for El Ni(o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, the interaction between scientists and policy makers has become more direct. The project will provide a better understanding of the structural and functional links involved in this process. This knowledge will contribute valuable information to three key groups involved in the policy-making process: (1) scientists involved in producing forecast products; (2) governmental and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) who have been mandated (e.g. U.N. Conference on Environment and Development, 1992) to disseminate these forecast tools; and (3) policy makers in sub-national, national and supra-national arenas who use this information in planning mitigation and development strategies and treatises.  In collaboration with a US and Chilean research team representing fisheries biology, environmental law and policy analysis and marine anthropology (funded by NOAA-Office of Global Programs under the title `Adaptations of the Fishing Sectors to the Impacts of El Ni(o Climate Variations: The Case of Chile`), the project will analyze the relationships among the societies and processes which result in decision making.  This timely project will contribute to a greater understanding of a range of information variables situated within a framework of diverse political, economic and cultural norms and values.",
