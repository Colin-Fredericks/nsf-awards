 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chi Ho Mak is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational   Chemistry Program to continue his research in path integral theory of   electron transport in chemical and biological systems.  Feynman path   integral theory is applied in conjunction with Quantum Monte Carlo   techniques to the study of the mechanisms for electron transport in a   number of molecular electronic systems.  The influence of the chemical   environment on the motions of the electron is examined in relation to the   quantum mechanical features of electron transfer reactions.  Various   aspects of tunneling, coherence, quantum interference and electron   correlation will be studied, and an effort will be made to understand the   crossover region between adiabatic and nonadiabatic barrier crossings.    Applications include studies of charge separation rate in the bacterial   photosynthetic reaction center, a potentially useful molecular quantum   interference device, and quantum conductance of one-dimensional molecular   wires.  The understanding of long-range transport of electrons in molecular   systems is of fundamental theoretical importance.  It is also one of the   key objectives in a rapidly growing area which has become known as   molecular electronics.  Molecular electronics involves the control of   electron flows in molecules through the use of external signals.  Work in   this area may eventually lead to electronic devices with miniaturization   on the order of molecular dimensions.",
