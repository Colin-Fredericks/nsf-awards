 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Drs. Murray Webster and Joseph Whitmeyer will purchase computer and related instrumentation of equip a laboratory to study social processes. The relevant part of the laboratory complex consists of eight small rooms. Participants in experiments are seated in separate rooms which also contain a computer terminal, a video camera and a monitor for all communication. In this way, communication can be completely open or limited networks can be created as needed. Information content, from experimenters to participants and between participants can either be veridical (true) or controlled. For example controlled disagreements can be created to measure performance expectation states. The NSF grant will provide the necessary instrumentation including a Gateway P5-200 computer, 8 Gateway P5-120 computers for terminals, cables to connect the terminals to server, 8 Sony video cameras and Panasonic video monitors and other related software are equipment.   With this laboratory, the researchers will study two basic social process. The first involves status generalization which structures face to face interaction around the status characteristics individuals bring with them to group situations. Its effects occur in task-focused interaction situations, where individuals are together for the purpose of solving problems or achieving a goal, such as on a team or a jury. Based on observed characteristics, individuals develop performance expectation states which are roughly equivalent to ideas of ability to perform whatever task is relevant to a group. A number of theories postulate on how these expectation states form and can be altered over time and these can be evaluated in controlled situations which the laboratory permits. The second research area involves exchange networks and how structural power originates and is maintained and expanded within them. Again the laboratory will allow the investigators to create controlled experimental situations.  This research is important for the light it will shed on interaction among individuals This state of the art laboratory will also provide a model which is likely to be reproduced in other universities and research settings.",
