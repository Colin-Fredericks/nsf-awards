These skyrmions are topological many-body excitations  in  a  two dimensional electron system (2DES) and have at present  been  observed  in  high  mobility GaAs  material.   The  Si/SiGe  material  has  potential  for integrated  circuit  use  and  this  planning  grant will attempt to control the valley  splitting  in  Si/SiGe  and  tune  it  to  near zero in  order  to  enhance  the  prospects  to observe skyrmions.  Demonstration of tunability  is  the primary goal.  %%%  A  predicted new type of electron excitation in a planar electron  system  (two-dimensional) called skyrmions has been  observed  in  gallium  arsenide  material that can be made with  high  electron  mobility. This high electron mobility has recently been  produced  in  a  silicon/silicon-germanium multilayer  structure  and  this  Research  Planning Grant will support the investigation  of  this  new  material  in  which skyrmions can be identified.  Since  the  silicon/silicon-germanium material has potential  for  commercial  use in the electronics industry the understanding of the behavior  of  the  excitations  that affect the electron  transport  is  of  considerable interest.  ***",
