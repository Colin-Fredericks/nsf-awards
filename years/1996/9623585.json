 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623585  Chen  This project will study the design, analysis, and implementation  of algorithmic techniques for solving geometric shortest path  problems, their generalizations, and applications.  Of interest  are not only theoretically efficient algorithms, but also  practically efficient ones.  The research has three main  interests: (a) Develop efficient algorithmic solutions for  several fundamental geometric shortest path problems that are  still outstanding (e.g., geometric shortest path queries), (b)  investigate new approaches to computing approximate geometric  shortest paths, and (c) design effective and practically  efficient paradigms for planning robotic shortest paths in the  plane and in higher dimensional spaces.  Several general  frameworks for processing exact and approximate geometric  shortest path queries will be investigated.  These frameworks  offer the promise of achieving new efficient algorithmic  techniques and data structures for geometric shortest path  queries and for other related problems.  Also, a paradigm is  being studied for obtaining practical solutions to planning  shortest obstacle-avoiding paths for robot motion in planar and  higher dimensional environments.  This paradigm is based on new  data structures called framed-quadtrees and framed-octrees, and  has led to new practical robotic path planning algorithms.  In  addition, algorithmic solutions for shortest paths and their  generalizations are applied to practical applications such as  data compression, computer vision, image processing, and VLSI  design.  New approaches for solving application problems based on  algorithms for shortest path problems and their generalizations  are studied.  The possibility of finding new methods for  geometric shortest paths that yield efficient implementation  performance on existing Massively Parallel Processing (MPP)  systems is also explored.  The research also includes an  important experimental component.    The education plan is to develop a new environment for t eaching  and experimenting with Massively Parallel Processing (MPP)  systems by utilizing the new EXECUBE-based MPP architectures.  The goal is to develop an inexpensive, but very robust, MPP  system for upper level undergraduate and entry level graduate  students to study and gain \"hands on\" experience with  parallelism.  The curriculum materials to be developed include  concise programming tutorials, lecture notes, sample programs,  and projects with sample solutions.  This work could provide an  integral part of not just electives in parallelism, but virtually  of all the upper level computer science and engineering  curriculum, and could even provide a basis to spill over into  other engineering and scientific disciplines.  ***",
