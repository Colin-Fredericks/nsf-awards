This proposal  will bring together a team of investigators to compare cholera outbreak data  and satellite imagery of phytoplankton blooms.  The satellite imagery will  be coupled with ground measurements of subsequent zooplankton blooms since  phytoplankton blooms almost always precede zooplankton bloom, as observed  in Bangladesh.  Productivity of plankton, a part of the global oceanic food  chain, is dependent on temperature and other nutrients present in the  environment.  It has been demonstrated that particular bacterial species  which are autochthonous members of marine and estuarine aquatic  environments are uniquely associated with zooplankton that feed on  phytoplankton.  By measuring the chlorophyll content of water through  remote sensing techniques, it is possible to assess the phytoplankton  population density and thereby estimate the concentration of bacterial  species with which they are associated.  Investigators from North and South America will visit several countries for  discussions and carry out preliminary investigations.  All collaborating  investigators will meet in Maryland to make the final preparations for  developing a full Phase II proposal to be submitted to the Inter-American  Institute for Global Change Research (IAI).  The Phase II proposal will  include a 2-3 year study during which an inverse model will be developed  based on the descriptive/quantitative model to monitor microbial ecosystem  from total pigment concentration data.  The data will be used as a tool to  predict the emergence of a particular species, e.g. Vibrio cholerae, in the  aquatic environment.  %%%  The association of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae with plankton has been  demonstrated for geographical regions such as Bangladesh and Latin America,  but the link between  plankton blooms and cholera outbreaks is less clear.

The  satellite imagery will be coupled with ground measurements of subsequent  zooplankton blooms since phytoplankton blooms almost always precede  zooplankton blooms, as observed in Bangladesh.  The PIs will meet with  investigators in South American countries to obtain epidemiological data  for areas along the coasts of South America for evidence of either  epidemics or elevated Vibrio cholerae counts.  All collaborating  investigators will meet in Maryland to make the final preparation to  develop an Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) Start-  Up Grant Phase II proposal.  The group of researchers makes up a strong collaboration among  microbiologists, ecologists and climatologists, and this collaboration will  bring a better understanding of biodiversity and the impact of climate  change on cholera epidemiology.  By focusing on cholera epidemics, this  collaboration of researchers is addressing a public health problem  affecting  many parts of the world, in particular South America.  The researchers of  this proposal are from Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, and the  United States.  These countries are members of the IAI, an initiative to  stimulate global change research among the scientific institutions of the  Americas.  The National Science Foundation is the designated U.S.  Government agency to carry out the U.S. responsibilities within the IAI.  ***",
