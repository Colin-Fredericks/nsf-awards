 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division, Gilbert will investigate the spectroscopy and photochemistry of   various nitrogen- and phosphorus-containing small inorganic radicals and   molecules, such as energetic halogen amines and phosphenes, in   low-temperature matrices.   Energy transfer will be studied in species   such as NX2 and PX2, where X = F, Cl.  The intermediates produced in the   photolysis of M(N3)3, where M is a Group 3 atom, will also be examined.    Ultraviolet/visible absorption and laser-induced fluorescence spectra   will be obtained from the matrix-isolated species to characterize their   electronic states as well as to aid in understanding the   photodissociation dynamics of the gas-phase compounds and their   intermediates.  Gaussian 94 calculations will be carried out on the   radicals formed.  The family of nitrogen-containing compounds known as halogen amines as   well as that of azide compounds are interesting because they are   notoriously unstable under standard conditions of temperature and   pressure.  The reasons for this behavior are not understood, but certain   trends are observed, such as increasing instability in going from   compounds containing fluorine to those containing chlorine, bromine, and   finally iodine.  An understanding of these issues in the halogen amines   and comparison with the phosphorus compounds may aid in elucidating the   chemical nature of other nitrogen- and phosphorus-bearing species.    Practical applications include the chemical etching of surfaces in   semiconductor processing, tribological thin-film coatings, and better   reagents for electronic-transition chemical laser systems.",
