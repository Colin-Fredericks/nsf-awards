 "awd_abstract_narration": "9528168  Vollmer  The general objective of this project is to investigate the  interaction of intense ultrasound energy with Escherichia  coli bacteria that have been genetically engineered to emit  visible light (bioluminescence) when subjected to physical  or chemical stress. Acoustic cavitation, the rapid growth  and violent collapse of micro-sized bubbles in response to  an impinging ultrasonic wave, is know to be responsible for  damage to biological cells in vivo and in vitro. The high  temperatures and pressures produced during radial bubble  collapse can produce direct and chemically-mediated effects  on nearby cells, or asymmetric bubble collapse can produce  high-velocity microjets that puncture cellular membranes or  bacterial walls. By systematically varying the acoustic  parameters and by using particular promoter::lux fusions in  genetically altered strains of E. Coli, this complex  interaction will be better understood, allowing for an  assessment to be made of the feasibility of applications  such as ultrasonic water purification and intracorporeal  sterilization of medical implants.    The investigation during this twelve month award would  follow a five step experimental protocol to test the  hypothesis that ultrasound causes damage to bacterial  membranes through the shear forces and free-radical  production that accompany violent inertial cavitation of  resonant microbubbles. The researches will use an heretofore  unavailable acoustical detection system for cavitation  together with a sensitive biological assay to quantify  bacterial stress response (luminescence).    The investigation is expected to provide an understanding of  the bacterial stress-response due to the collapse of  microbubbles undergoing transient cavitation that would help  optimize the killing of bacteria and lead to improved  sterilization procedures.  ***",
