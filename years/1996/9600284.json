The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a fifteen-month postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. Beverly J. Johnson, which will consist  of a twelve-month research project working with Professor  Allan R. Chivas at the University of Wollongong in  Australia, and a three month re-entry award at the  University of Colorado to work with Professor Gifford H.  Miller.        Vegetation in northern Australia is heavily influenced by  the intensity of the monsoon and appears to have the  potential to influence the intensity of the monsoon.  An  evaluation of the vegetation regimes responding to  variations in the monsoon both prior to and after human  arrival in conjunction with the fire-history of this area  will allow for an evaluation of the role humans played on  vegation and subsequent climate change in the continental  interior.  Dr. Johnson will analyze the stable isotope  geochemistry of organic compounds extracted from core  material in the Gulf of Carpentaria.  The techniques  proposed in this study provide some of the most powerful  methods for tracking paleovegetation in marine vegetation  currently known.  If the predicted vegetation changes are  measured, they will provide evidence linking the effects of  human burning on vegetation and climate change in the  Australian interior.  Paleovegetation records reconstructed  from the sediments in the Gulf will provide the ground  truthing data necessary to verify the paleoclimate models.        Upon her return to the United States, Dr. Johnson will  complete any remaining analyses and write up the results of  her research.  She will receive additional support for her  re-entry period through a grant from NSF's ATM program.        ***",
