 "awd_abstract_narration": "9602870  Paugh  In Dominica, a French creole (Kweyol) dating to early  French colonization remains in use along with different  varieties of English (the official language). An  urban/rural split exists: the most \"standard\" English  is spoken in the capital town, while Kweyol and different  varieties of English are spoken throughout the rural village  population. Though historically denigrated by middle-  class urbanites, Kweyol has figured centrally in the state's  project of building a unified post-colonial nation since  Independence in 1978. But while the attitudes of many  middle-class urban adults towards Kweyol are changing, rural  villagers still struggle with restricted skills in English  and view Kweyol as a disability. Children growing up  today face a sociolinguistically complex environment where  multilingualism is accompanied by multiple language  ideologies concerning language choice. How children become  communicatively competent in the language(s) and language  ideologies of their communities in such a highly variable,  multilingual creole environment will be investigated through  a longitudinal child language socialization study of six  children (in both town and village). The children's  naturally occurring speech with various interlocutors during  daily activities will be systematically audio-tape recorded,  transcribed, and analyzed. This study will investigate the  links between changing language ideologies and practices,  language choice and identity construction, and post-colonial  nation building in Dominica. It will yield data on  multilingual language acquisition, the social organization  of caregiving, processes of language maintenance and shift,  and the learning of cultural and linguistic practices in a  creole society. It will contribute to several growing areas  of research including linguistic ideologies. language and  nationalism, creole sociolinguistics, and Caribbean area  studies.  ***",
