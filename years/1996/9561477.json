 "awd_abstract_narration": "This small business Innovation Research Phase I project is to identify and develop the materials required to make Large Area Fiber Optic Tapers for detectors needed to do macromolecular x-ray crystallography using rotating anode sources.  Large area CCD based fiber optic taper detectors for x-ray crystallography have been successfully fabricated and tested using a synchrotron x-ray source.  However, when using a rotating anode x-ray source, which is not as intense or as collimated as a synchrotron, the resulting images are not of the quality desired for optimum results.  The problems encountered with these detectors are excessive background noise and low spatial resolution.  Initial research into the problems indicate that materials presently used for Large Area Fiber Optic Tapers are not ideally suited for solving these problems.  The objective of the research is to identify and develop the materials required to improve the performance of these detectors.   If CCD based Large Area Detectors can be successfully developed for use with rotating anode x-ray sources a significant step can be made in the field of x-ray crystallography.   The speed of acquiring x-ray diffraction images with a CCD based detector can be up to 10 times faster with better resolution and data quality than is presently available with Image Plate detectors.       This project will have a significant impact on the development of a new generation of x-ray crystallography detectors to meet the ever increasing demands for analyzing complex crystal structure.",
