These topics by and large have not been systematically  covered in the general books dealing with asymptotics, yet are of great  significance in applied science and engineering.  For instance, the central  limit theorem is one of the keystones of probability theory, yet no readily  available source on asymptotics has discussed its applications and  ramifications.  Certain problems in combinatorics, in particular, the  theory of random walks, can be elucidated by asymptotic methods; yet these  have received no unified treatment.  Most books have an extensive treatment  of differential equations, but difference equations, which are just as  important, require their own methods of attack.  Renewal equations, which  arise in investigations in computer science and engineering, have been  occasionally treated but have not yet received the attention they deserve.  The topics to be investigated are motivated by these deficiencies:  the  drunkard's walk and convolution sequences;  the stability and convergence  of the solutions of non-linear difference equations;  the application of  probabilistic methods to problems in applied asymptotic analysis; error  distribution in the numerical inversion of matrices; and renewal equations  arising in the recovery of information in communications systems employing  multiaccess channels.  %%%    Scientists are often interested in what happens \"in the large.\"  Examples of this abound in everyday life.  For instance, if the number of  users of the internet continues to grow in some well-defined fashion, what  precisely will happen to the time required to log onto the system?  What is  the likelihood that a medication ingested into the human system will reach  its target after an extended period of time?  How are the populations of a  given agricultural pest and the plants on which it feeds related over an  extended period of time?  Is the future growth in major criminal  offenses  in a city strongly dependent on the current rate of minor criminal  offenses?  Will the population of a country, given sufficient food supply,  continue to grow at a disastrous rate, or are there self-limiting features  of population growth that will prevent this from happening?   The  scientific mathematical language often used to model such situations is  called the theory of difference equations.  In this research program, we  intend to develop new methods for attacking such equations, and hence to  help resolve some practical issues which these equations describe.  ***",
