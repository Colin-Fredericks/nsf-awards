 "awd_abstract_narration": "9530403  Freed  Theoretical research will continue on developing theories  for calculating the thermodynamic properties of polymer  melts, blends, block copolymers, glasses and liquid  crystals.  A main and novel feature of this theoretical  approach involves the combined treatment of monomer  molecular structures, local correlations, and  compressibility.  The principal investigator will continue  this work by extending his lattice cluster theory to include  semiflexibility in order to describe polymer glasses and  liquid crystals.  Another aspect of the proposed research  will involve continued studies of the influence of short  chain branching (and semiflexibility) on the miscibility of  polymer blends (with special focus on polyolefin blends)  and, if time permits, on their interfacial properties.  Other phenomena to be studied include the pressure  dependence of polymer blend miscibility and glass transition  temperatures.  The accurate description of polymer blends  and of polymer liquid crystals with models containing  complex monomer structures will require the inclusion of  contributions from long range correlations, contributions  that only can be evaluated with the aid of sophisticated  computer-based combinatorial algorithms which will be  devised and applied to this project.  %%%  This theoretical research involves both analytical and  computational components.  The research will determine a  variety of properties of polymers and their mixtures using a  formalism developed by the principal investigator.  Modifications to this formalism will be made in order to  model more realistic situations.  ***",
