 "awd_abstract_narration": "This effort is funded as a Research Planning Grant (RPG). The  availability of shared-memory, multiprocessor workstation  clusters offers the opportunity for the simultaneous application  of shared memory and distributed memory parallel processing  techniques to a single problem.  However, software systems that  facilitate this dual-level parallel processing paradigm and allow  the programmer, compiler, and run-time system to make the best  use of the computational power offered by this platform are not  yet available.  The long-term goal of this research is threefold:  (1) to provide a software system that furnishes advice regarding  the partitioning methods and cluster configuration expected to  yield the best performance,  (2) to develop a communication  library that handles both shared and distributed memory  communications with a single syntax, and  (3)  to incorporate  both the advisory system and the communication library into a  data-parallel compiler that transparently handles interprocessor  communication.    During the research planning phase, which is being supported by  this grant award, four initial steps toward the long-term  research goals will be accomplished.   (a) The computation and  communication characteristics of the multiprocessor cluster will  be characterized. (b) Mathematical models of performance of  applications that exhibit stencil data dependencies will be  developed. (c) The advisory system will be designed and  implemented with the initial mathematical models. (d) The current  body of research on shared memory and distributed memory  communication libraries and data-parallel compilers will be  surveyed to determine the best approach for developing the  dual-level communication library and incorporating the library  into existing compilers.  ***",
