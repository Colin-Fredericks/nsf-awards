 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    Proposal Number:  CTS-9634120  PI:  Mei     This is a study of a range of problems that are of interest to the field of coastal engineering.   The common feature of the problems under study is that they have several contrasting length or time scales.  Asymptotic and numerical analysis as well as experimental investigations are being used to investigate the underlying physics.  The problems under investigation are: a) Effects of surface waves on the resuspension and transport of very fine sediments, b) Wave induced formation of sand ripples and bars, c) Long-period harbor oscillations induced by narrow banded short waves, and d) Subharmonic resonance of waves trapped in an array of vertical cylinders.   The subject of fine sediment erosion and transportation in shallow water bodies is an important problem with serious environmental implications.  The study of long period oscillations and subharmonic resonance of waves in an array of cylinders are of importance to the design of harbor facilities.  All four topics have an experimental and a theoretical component.",
