It is hypothesized that the amount of training hours and the number of training courses offered/ taken are positively related to affiliate size, environmental complexity, labor market competition, and profits.  The investigator will study a large for-profit corporation, its affiliates, and 500 employees within these affiliates.  The diverse and geographically dispersed affiliates of this organization will permit the investigator to explore how affiliate-specific organizational characteristics affect the process and outcomes of training.  The three basic questions that will be investigated are:  (1) What effect does an organization's environment and structure have on the amount of employee training the organization provides?, (2) How do these features influence the structure of the training department? and (3) What is the relationship between the organizational structure, environment, characteristics of individual employees and the amounts and type of training that employees with different characteristics receive?  This research will inform theoretical and empirical debate in the sociology of organizations as well as orgnizational and governmental training policies.  %%%  Data will be collected through surveys of individual employees, in-depth interviews, archival sources, and participant observation.  Organizational- and individual- level data will be analyzed using multi-level statistical techniques.",
