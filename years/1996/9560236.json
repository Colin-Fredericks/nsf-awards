 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project will analyze and design a wideband wireless network for the transmission of transaction traffic, file traffic and digital voice traffic.  Multiple access protocols are used to permit independent transmitters to share a single communication channel. When the number of transmitters is large or when the duty cycle of individual transmitters is small a random access multiple access protocol is usually required. Spread ALOHA is a new random access protocol which can operate at a data rate 50 or more times that of conventional protocols.    Spread ALOHA uses a single spreading code to transmit signals from an unlimited number of remote transmitters. In this research project it is planned to analyze and design an improved form of Spread ALOHA which uses two codes rather than one for all transmitters. By means of the second code it is possible to greatly increase the throughput in wideband wireless networks with significant amounts of file and voice traffic.       This research can be used to build less expensive, more efficient personal communication services (PCS) networks integrating transaction traffic, file traffic and digital voice traffic.",
