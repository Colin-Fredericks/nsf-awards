 "awd_abstract_narration": "9631063  Wraight  The photosynthetic reaction center (RC) provides an almost  ideal system for studying the roles of internal  electrostatics and conformational mobility in protein  function, and this project focusses on two important topics:  (1) intra-protein proton transfer, which plays a crucial  role in almost all catalysis, and (2) conformational  relaxations in response to internal charge generation and  displacement, also of universal importance  in catalytic  function.  Specific experiments are proposed for RCs from  Rb. sphaeroides and Rps. viridis, both of which have known  atomic structures. (i) Site-specific mutagenesis of selected  residues in the L, M and H subunits of the bacterial RC,  chosen to probe their role in proton transfer coupled to the  reduction of QA and QB.  Charge movements will be monitored  by electrochromic effects on the RC pigments, by direct  electrical measurements on membrane systems, and by infra-  red spectroscopy (ii) Studies of osmotic pressure and  solvent isotope effects to probe the role of internal waters  as a reservoir of protons inside the protein, and of bulk  water in the exchange of quinone and quinol at the QB site.  Both effects will be assayed by measurements of multiple  turnovers of the RC, driven at high light intensity, to  reveal limiting steps in the steady-state turnover.  (iii)  Studies of P+  QA - charge recombination as a function of  temperature and pre-illumination, using the charge  recombination kinetics as an assay of the energentics, and  spectral responses of the pigments as an assay of the  internal electric field.  The research will probe the nature  of the important conformation events by controlling the RC  ground state through the ionic milieu and the pH, and by  using selected mutants.  This work will be extented to P+ QB-  recombination, over the temperature range that it works.  %%%  All aspects of protein structure and function depend on the  myriad of electrostatic interactions between atoms and  groups inside the  molecule.  Almost all aspects of protein  function require movement of the molecule, at all levels of  organization from individual atoms to coordinated motions of  sections of the macromolecule.  Such movements respond to  and generate electrostatic effects, so that the two are  intimately entwined., have been increasingly recognized in  recent years.  Although of very general importance,  experimental systems suitable for studying these processes  are extremely limited and, especially with respect to  dynamic events, they are essentially restricted to light  activated protein reactions.  This project utilizes the  photosynthetic reaction center (RC) from a bacterium as an  ideal model system for studying these fundamentally  important processes.  The light-driven reaction of the RC  generates charge movements inside the protein, which  initiate molecular motions (conformational relaxations)  which then modify the subsequent behavior of the charges.  These events can be disentangled by selective modification  of the structure of the RC by mutagenesis, and by  restricting the time-evolution of the RC states by cooling  to low temperatures.  Conformational motions are also  necessary to allow small molecules in and out of a protein,  as part of the protein's functional cycle.  This, too, will  be studied in terms of how protons pass through the protein  to reach their site of reaction,  how water inside the  protein is involved in this, and how water comes and goes as  other molecules enter  and leave their active sites.  ***",
