 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) activity   directed by Dr. Martin E. Schimpf of the Chemistry Department at Boise   State University, and supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry   Program in the Division of Chemistry.  The focus of the research is on   Thermal Field-Flow Fractionation (ThFFF).  This separation technique is   based on thermal diffusion and the separation process is known to depend   on both the chemical composition and  the molecular weight or size of the   compounds under investigation.  Work by undergraduate students will be   done to develop a fundamental understanding of thermal diffusion,   particularly in terms of the separation of macromolecules and particulate   matter.   The effect of properties of the sample material and the carrier   solvent will be studied to reveal their impact on retention.  Factors   governing thermophoretic motion of polymers such as the effect of chain   branching will be investigated.  The knowledge gained from the   fundamental work will be applied to practical separation problems   involving copolymers.  A combination of ThFFF with measurements of   viscosity will be used to obtain the average molecular weight and   composition of block copolymers.    Two-dimensional separations using   ThFFF and size exclusion chromatography will be investigated.  The ability to separate the components of complex mixtures of compounds   is vital to the successful solution of a number of major problems in   chemical analysis such as the identity and concentration of environmental   pollutants, and the composition of drug formulations.  This project, to   be carried out by undergraduate students, will investigate the   fundamental basis and applications of a separation method known as   Thermal Field-Flow Fractionation (ThFFF).  A major factor for the   interest in this approach is that the method is potentially applicable to   the separation of polymer materials in solution and solid particles of   matter.",
