 "awd_abstract_narration": "The current rapid increase in the level of affordable computer  hardware, and the ready availability of a variety of -computational  chemistry software packages, have made molecular modeling  accessible to all levels of the undergraduate curriculum.   Construction and visualization of molecules have become valuable  teaching tools, yet many chemical educators have had limited or no  experience with this medium.  This three year project will offer  college faculty in New England and eastern New York an opportunity  to learn about using molecular modeling in their undergraduate  courses.  A three and one half day workshop will be held each June  at the University of Massachusetts, with a follow-up symposium to  be held in January. Participants will gain familiarity with the  basic theory and practical use of molecular mechanics and  semi-empirical molecular orbital calculations and will receive a  brief introduction to ab-initio methods.  The emphasis of the  workshop will be on the use of these techniques to teach and learn  undergraduate chemistry.  We will further advise the participants  in establishing computational chemistry programs at their home  institutions.  During January participants and local educators from  the Five-College region will be invited to the University to  exchange success stories and discuss methods of incorporating  modeling into undergraduate courses.",
