 "awd_abstract_narration": "U. of California, Santa Barbara  This project examines the extent to which blind and vision impaired people can develop and use in everyday tasks, spatial information at the `geographic` scale.  The methodology will utilize matched groups of congenitally blind individuals (blind from birth), partially sighted and sighted participants.  Matching will be by age, sex, culture and socio-economic factors.  Tasks to be used in the research include location, distance estimation, model building, direction finding and route following.  Information will be obtained from the participants and subsequently compared by using verbal instructions and videotaping of question and answer sessions.  The analysis will also make use of debriefing sessions, preliminary consultative and background interviews.  The resulting data will be analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively.  The research will have a cross cultural component where information on cognitive mapping and human navigation will be compared between the U.S. and the U.K.  These studies will be closely matched to allow direct comparison.  This aspect of the research is important because of the debate as to whether the concept of disability is functionally driven.  Blind and vision impaired persons in the U.S. have been faced with a `normalization, independent and self-help` ethic whereas in the U.K. there is a `social welfare` ethic of assistance.  Dr Mark Blades at University of Sheffield and Dr Robert Kitchin at University of Swansea will participate in this aspect of the work.  Scale effects and cross-cultural comparisons have been largely ignored in work on spatial cognition of blind and vision impaired.  The research addresses basic problems relating to theories of spatial cognition by this disabled group, as well as, practical problems of the ways in which spatial abilities and actions by blind and vision impaired people can be enhanced in a manner that influences their quality of life.  The results will contribute to the body of information revealing how the visually impaired and blind think about and behave in an everyday geographic environment.  This enhanced understanding has important policy implications concerning planning and education.  In addition the work will likely provide information on ways this group's wayfinding and orientation skills may be enhanced.",
