Site  directed mutagenesis will be used to modify residues on both  the RC and cytochrome in the interfacial region.  The types  of mutations to be constructed are: 1) Charge reversals:  carboxyl groups on the RC will be changed to Lys and Lys on  the cytochrome will be changed to carboxyls.  The binding of  Rcs and cytochromes with compensating mutations at  interacting  site should show improvement in the binding. 2)  Formation of hydrophobic binding domains: polar residues on  both proteins in the binding domain will be converted to  hydrophobic residues to increase stability of the complex.  3) Site directed crosslinking: Cys residues will be  introduced at putative interacting sites on both RC and  cytochrome and used to crosslink the two proteins into a  stable configuration.  The binding constants and electron  transfer rates of the complexes formed by mutated proteins  will be measured and correlated with the structural changes  in order to deduce the structure of the RC-cytochrome  complex.  Mutations will be made to improve the binding of  the cytochrome to the RC to facilitate structural studies of  the RC-cytochrome complex by x-ray diffraction.  %%%  Electron transfer reactions in biological membranes are  essential to provide energy necessary for life processes.  The reaction between cytochrome c2 and the RC in  photosynthetic bacteria displays both the specificity in  binding and high rate of interprotein electron transfer  within the bimolecular complex necessary to maintain a fast  electron transfer through the electron transfer chain.  These studies of the binding and electron transfer reactions  of between cytochrome c2 and the bacterial RC are aimed at  determining fundamental principles of protein association  and electron transfer  in biology that should provide the  basis for understanding energy conversion processes in other  important biological systems.  ***",
