 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made in the Office of Special Projects of the Chemistry   Division in support of the continuing research of Dr. Andrew Barron at   Rice University. The  research will focus on the role of precursor   molecular structure during chemical vapor deposition of Group 13-16   materials and the synthesis and reactivity of new Group 13-chalcogenide   compounds.  Having discovered that metastable solid phases can be formed   from  stable cage structure intermediates, conditions will be   investigated which retain the cage structure in the gas phase. To this   end, an aerosol-CVD system will be built which will eliminate gas phase   decomposition. Specifically, cyclic and cage organometallic complexes of   gallium and indium, sufides, selenides and tellurides will be synthesized   and decomposed under conditions designed to preserve the structural   integrity of the precursors, New phases will be characterized by Auger   spectroscopy, XPS, TEM, SEM, x-ray diffraction and electron diffraction.   Mechanistic studies of phase growth will be followed by time-of-flight   mass spectrometry and matrix isolation of the decomposition products.   Other studies will investigate the use of gallium-sulfide cages as   molecular building blocks for extended mesophase structures and the use   of caged gallium sulfide structures as models for alumoxanes in Ziegler   polymerization.  The fundamental chemistry of Group 13-16 chalcogenides is less well   developed than the corresponding oxides  This research will define the   structural and kinetic requirements for the design and synthesis of new   solid phases for applications in compound semiconductors, catalysis, and   porous zeolite-like materials.",
