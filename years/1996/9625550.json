During the last decade it  was discovered that a wave mechanics approach must be adopted when  describing the propagation of an electron through any small  conductor, including insulators and dirty metals as well as nearly  perfect crystals. Electron interference effects, which are  responsible for many of the large fluctuations observed in  transport experiments, can be traced to the existence of large  phase coherence times for the wave function of the electron. These  large times in turn have lead to the discovery of persistent  currents in normal metals, Universal Conductance Fluctuations  (UCF), h/e & h2e Aharonov-Bohm effects, non-local quantum effects,  length-independent conductance fluctuations, and an understanding  of how these new quantum effects ensemble average to their  classical values.  Very little is known about the properties of  the wavefunction which describes  systems on time scales comparable to the coherence time (t~10-9  sec).  The recent discovery that it is possible to make two  terminal mesoscopic devices through which we can control the  passage of electrons, one at a time, by using a third capacitively  coupled gate electrode to the sample has generated much hope that  these devices might be the transistors of the future.  The  frequency at which these single electrons pass through the device  is f=IDc/e and is on the order of lx109 Hz for most samples  studied to date.  The applications of such a technology are quite  extensive.  They range from transistors to ultra-sensitive  electrometers and current standards.  In this project we will  systematically explore the high frequency properties of these  types of mesoscopic systems by using a new instrument that will  allow us to directly measure the high frequency transport and  magnetic properties of our samples.  We believe that attemp ts to  probe mesoscopic systems on a time scale comparable to the  coherence time of the wavefunction will almost certainly produce a  better understanding of the true nature of the quantum physics of  these systems.  %%%   Since the physics of small structures provides the foundation  upon which future electronic industry technologies may be based,  it is extremely important that we identify and understand all the  potentially relevant physical properties that these systems  exhibit.  Only after these properties are reasonably well  understood can we attempt to propose to use any one of them in a  new or improved technology.  The work described here is a  relatively new direction for the studies of mesoscopic structures:  we believe experiments in the area of magnetic and transport  properties of mesoscopic structures are likely to discover new  phenomena which have yet to be anticipated and expand our  fundamental knowledge of condensed matter science.  ***",
