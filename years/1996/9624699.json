 "awd_abstract_narration": "9624699 Santos  This research project aims to advance the materials science of InSb/AlInSb heteroepitaxy, and to explore the properties of two-dimensional electron systems confined within InSb quantum wells.  The extreme properties of InSb--small energy gap, high intrinsic electron mobility, small electron effective mass, large g-factor, and non-parabolic conduction band--are expected to lead to novel magneto-optical and magnetotransport behavior of electrons in InSb quantum wells at low temperatures.  MBE growth of fully strained heterostructures on InSb substrates will be pursued and growth conditions optimized to achieve higher crystal quality than obtainable with GaAs substrates; growth conditions will also be studied to achieve high quality InSb/AlInSb heterostructures.  Far IR laser spectroscopy will be used to assess effects of non-parabolicity on electron confinement.  By combining results of magneto-optical and magneto-transport measurements, the conduction and valence band offsets in InSb/AlInSb heterojunctions will also be addressed.  The freedom to change quantum well width, barrier composition, and strain will be employed to study mechanisms of spin splitting.  Because of the low disorder anticipated in these materials combinations there is expected to be an unusual opportunity to explore the possibility of electron correlation effects in narrow-gap semiconductors. %%% The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level of technological relevance to several aspects of advanced electronic, photonic and magnetic devices and integrated circuitry.  Additionally, the knowledge and understanding gained from this research project is expected to contribute in a general way to improving the performance of advanced devices and circuits by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved materials.  An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fund amentally and technologically significant area. ***",
