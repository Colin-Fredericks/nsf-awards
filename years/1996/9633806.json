 "awd_abstract_narration": "DORTCH  9633806           Understanding the relationship between environmental  conditions and Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) in coastal  areas is essential for predicting blooms, protecting human  health, and preventing economic losses.  Recently,  considerable interest has focused on Pseudo-nitzschia, a  diatom genus in which some species produce domoic acid, a  potent neurotoxin, causing, among other things, death or  short-term memory loss (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning; ASP).  Preliminary data from the Louisiana coastal zone show that  Pseudo-nitzschia spp. (including potentially toxic  species) reach very high abundances every spring in the  plumes of the Mississippi and Atchafalya Rivers, and high  abundances occur frequently, but less predictably in a  Louisiana estuary. The hypothesized link between HABs and  eutrophication will be tested by 1) comparing the highly  eutrophic shelf environment with the less eutrophic  estuary and 2) examining changes in Pseudo-nitzschia  preserved in cores taken from the shelf where increasing  eutrophication over time is well documented.  Through a  combination of new sampling and analysis of archived  samples, a nearly ten year record of Pseudo-nitzschia  species composition at a shelf site and a four year  database of species composition and toxin production at  both the estuarine and shelf sites will be related to a  suite of environmental factors measured at the same time.  New biotechnological methods for measuring toxin  concentration, using a competitive receptor binding assay,  and identifying Pseudo-nitzschia species, using molecular  probes, will be tested in comparison with other more  standard methods. The new techniques were developed as  rapid and accurate screening methods which will ultimately  be used for a wide range of applications in both the  public and private sectors. Using these methods as part of  this research represents a mutually beneficial  collaboration between academic and government researchers  and private industry.",
