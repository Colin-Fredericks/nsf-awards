Multiple imputation methodology is  the most   effective inferential method available for handling the common   and complex problem of nonresponse in sample surveys, especially  those that produce public-use data files shared by many users.    The multiple imputation framework was established under the  Bayesian perspective, mainly because the Bayesian approach  provides a coherent and flexible general framework for  constructing sophisticated imputation models that incorporate all  available information.  However, the fact that the public-use  data files are designed to be shared by many users requires that  the procedures used for creating multiple imputations, and for  analyzing the multiply-imputed data sets, must have good  frequentist properties.  Thus, the study and use of multiple  imputation highlights and requires the melding of the Bayesian  and frequentist perspectives, thus posing many challenging and  intriguing research problems at the intersection of these two  perspectives.  To effectively tackle these problems, this  research is conducted simultaneously at two levels. At the  general level, the research examines new robust frequentist  properties of Bayesian procedures.  At the specific level, the  research studies the use of these properties in multiple  imputation, with a focus on constructing new procedures as well  as justifying existing ones under more general conditions.  Specific topics include confidence validity under uncongenial  multiple imputation inferences, frequentist properties of   posterior predictive p-values, and unbiased imputations with  single observation unbiased priors.  This research studies the important and complicated problem of  nonresponse, a problem inherent to all  sample surveys. The most  serious problem caused by nonresponse is nonresponse bias, that  is, those people who do not respond are systematically different  from those who do respond.  Su ch systematic differences have been  repeatedly documented in the social, economic, and statistical  literature, for example, on self-reporting of income.  If the  bias is not corrected and only the answers from respondents are  used, a very distorted picture of the characteristics (e.g.,  average annual income of households) of the underlying population  is likely to be obtained. Correcting for such systematic  distortion, especially for large public-data files, is a  very complex and demanding task.  The basic task is to reduce the  nonresponse bias by using available information (e.g.,  demographic information) on the nonrespondents to predict their  missing values.  Since we have uncertainty in our prediction, we  need more than one prediction, i.e. imputation, to honestly  display the uncertainty. With more than one imputation, it  becomes straightforward for an individual user to estimate   the loss of information due to nonresponse and thus obtain valid  statistical inference using only standard complete-data analysis  procedures.  It is obvious that the quality of the imputation  model has direct impact on the quality of the subsequent  statistical analyses. A main aim of this research is to provide  better and more flexible methodologies for constructing  imputation models; the significance of such a research is  highlighted by the fact that the analyses of public-use data  files typically have a profound impact on our society because the  conclusions from these analyses are typically used to answer  questions in economics, education, demographic studies, public  health and policy, sociology, political science, among others.   Another aim of this research is to explore the possible use of  the methodologies developed for multiple imputation to  missing-data problems in other content areas, such as the problem  of handling the missing observations in ultraviolet radiation  measurements, which are crucial for accessing global atmospheric  changes due to ozone depletion.",
