 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a 12 month Research Planning Grant award under the Research Planning Grants and Career Advancement Awards for Women Scientists and Engineers Program. The goal of this planning grant is to perform preliminary investigations and experiments into the integration of multiple autonomous agents in solving resource-constrained project scheduling problems, with the aim of developing a competitive NSF proposal. The core problem is how to effectively build a schedule for a project comprising a number of activities that are linked by precedence relations and multiple resource restrictions. When cash flows exist in the form of initiation expenses and progress payments, the development of schedules that maximize the net present value of the project is of considerable practical importance. This research explores the potential for integrating a probabilistic combination model and a meta-heuristic search control strategy in solving the practical problem of project scheduling with cash flows. It also investigates the potential for researching how multiple intelligent agents interact in a decision support environment for combinatorially difficult problems.",
