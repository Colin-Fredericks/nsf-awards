The excitations are formed in  single  events  by energetic UV photons and electrons,  and  in  dense  cascades  induced by keV and MeV ions. The goal is to  understand  the  dynamics  of  energy  transport in the form  of  holes,  excitons  and  excited electrons in the femtosecond to nanosecond time scale, and  to  understand  the  mechanisms for converting the  electronic  energy  in  atomic motion (molecular dissociation, formation of new molecules, the  ejection of particles from the surface, and creation of stable defects  and  phonons).   The  strategy is to study condensed  gases  as  model  systems,  for which basic cross sections are well known. The  research  involves a collaboration with scientists from Bell Labs and the  Univ.  of  Uppsala.  It  combines experiments that detect the ejected  atoms,  molecules, electrons, ions, and photons, and changes in the  bombarded  solids, together with molecular dynamics simulations.  %%%  This  project is a university-industry investigation of the  processes  of  energy  dissipation  in solids which are  bombarded  by  energetic  particles  or ultraviolet light. The goal is to understand how  energy  flows  into different channels, like emission of  light or  damage  of  the material, that will allow to find ways to modify the behavior. The  research  has  applications in many areas, like radiation  effects  in  biological   tissue,  lithography  for  manufacturing  microelectronic  circuits,  radiation detectors and future generations  of  flat  panel  displays  and  lasers in the far ultraviolet. The studies  incorporate  laboratory work and computer simulations.  ***",
