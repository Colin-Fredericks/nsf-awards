 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  research is primarily aimed at robustly locating deformable  structures/objects  of  approximately known  shape  from  natural  images.   The  problem  of  locating and  recognizing  underlying  object  structures  in an image is of importance  in  many  image  analysis and computer vision applications including robot vision,  pattern  recognition and biomedical image processing.  Algorithms  that can reliably perform these basis tasks are at the core of  a  variety  of  systems that will permit humans to more  effectively  interact  with  pictorial data for the purposes of visualization,  analysis,  control or, as in the case of image database  systems,  retrieval  of task-specific information within these applications  areas.   The  robust  identification  and  measurement  of   such  structure  is  not  always  achievable using  a  single  analysis  technique  that  depends  on a single  image  derived  source  of  information.  This is especially true when one is dealing with  a  wide  range of images obtained under different conditions  having  different  image content.  The approach in this research  project  utilizes two different sources of image-derived information:  1.)  gray-level gradients and ii.) homogeneity of intensity or texture  elements,   etc.,   as  well  as  model-based  information   (i.e  approximate    object   shape).    Furthermore,   two   different  processing  methods are combined in this approach,  in  order  to  integrate the above-mentioned information sources: a) regionbased  methods, which are primarily based on homogeneity properties  and  b.)   boundary   methods  which  capitalize  on   both   gradient  (imagederived)  and  shape  (model  based)  properties.   A  game  theoretic  framework  will  be used,  where,  unlike  the  global  objective approach which is widely used as an integration  method  in  computer vision, the modularity of the underlying  objectives  are retained.  The integration problem is then framed as a family  of  coupled and coex isting objectives whereby the output  of  one  module  depends  upon the previous outputs of the other  modules.  This  effort  will build on initial work which has been  able  to  locate  structure in two dimensional images.  It will also extend  the  concept  to  analyzing three dimensional image  data.   Both  theoretical  and experimental investigations will be carried  out  regarding the applicability and the limits of the approach.",
