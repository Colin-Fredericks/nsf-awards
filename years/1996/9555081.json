 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes to design and teach a course on modern  techniques for cryptographic protocols and their  ramifications. The course would be accessible to students  with no special mathematical background or talent. The  primary goal of the course is to expose students to  fundamental concepts in mathematics and theoretical computer  science, using cryptography as a vehicle. A second goal is  to give students a background in an area that will be  increasingly important as use of the Internet grows and as  our economy becomes more heavily based on trade in  information (including software, audio, video and film,  marketing data, etc.). Finally, the potential for widespread  use of cryptography and digital signatures brings into focus  such controversial and important issues as the conflict  between privacy and law enforcement; the course would  provide a forum for discussion of such issues. The intention  is that the course would serve both to educate non-science  majors and to attract prospective majors to the sciences.  Because there is currently no textbook that addresses the  subject at a level accessible to students that are not  mathematically oriented, this project will develop suitable  course materials. Such materials include course notes and  homework assignments. In addition, the PI will develop a  small programming language and visual environment in which  even a novice programmer can develop and experiment with  cryptographic protocols. As part of the course, students  will have \"lab assignments\" in which they are led through  such experimentation. The PI wil make the course materials,  the programming language and environment, and the lab  assignments widely available to prospective teachers of  similar courses at other colleges.",
