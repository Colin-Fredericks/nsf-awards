In Phase I, Leadership Teams (one physics teacher and one Tech pre teacher) and project staff will develop workshop materials for a 3-wekk workshop, Learning Through Manufacturing Experiences.  This will be done during a five-week program which includes a 3-week internship with Peavey Electronics Corporation and two week of materials adaptation and content reinforcement at Mississippi State University.  During the second, third and fourth years of the project two cohorts of 24 physics and tech prep teachers will participate in these workshops designed to equip them with knowledge and experience of the skills necessary for students to enter the world of manufacturing and the content knowledge to develop those skills.  Academic year follow-up includes site visits to schools of participants, Internet communication and one-day workshops in association with professional teachers' conferences.",
