 "awd_abstract_narration": "A group member who is especially salient in the group because of a distinctive characteristic is referred to as a solo.  Women and minorities who occupy senior positions within organizations often do so as solos.  Researchers have suggested a number of ways in which solo status may have important long term consequences for the ultimate success or failure of the solo individual in an organization.  For example, solos often attract increased attention from observers, and they are often evaluated negatively and on the basis of stereotypes rather than actual performance.  The proposed research will examine two basic issues.  First, whether solo status increases the likelihood for solos to emerge as leaders in task groups.  Second, whether observed solo effects vary as a function of the perceived salience of the solo.  The proposed research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the psychological processes that characterize solo arrangements in group settings.  Results of the proposed research should also clarify how such effects occur in race contexts.",
