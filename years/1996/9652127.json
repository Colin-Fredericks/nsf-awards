 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditional teaching of math and science to non-majors through disciplinary breadth courses does not address new realities.  These courses lack connectivity and fail to cover a broad scope of relevant scientific issues or to adequately educate students, particularly the significant population of average students, in the analytical and quantitative skills needed to function competently in a technological world.  These critical parts of general education should be totally reformulated with courses specifically designed to provide basic but broad scientific, technical and quantitative skills to a diverse student body.  St. Andrews, with a highly regarded interdisciplinary general education program and a strong math/science program, has designed and is pilot testing the concepts of a visionary two-course sequence that combines quantitative skills with scientific and technological  material of public interest selected from the natural and social sciences.  Pedagogy capitalizes on the enormous potential of technology including networked computers and Internet.  Math/science majors will participate in the courses as student assistants/mentors.  The goal is to have the program institution-wide by Fall 1998.  Pembroke State University will work jointly with St. Andrews on the project.  Over 500 students and 23 faculty will be directly involved in the project (800+ students/yr beyond).  Intensive and objective assessment will measure student learning outcomes to compare with results from traditional breadth courses.  Such pervasive changes require substantial faculty development to deliver the curricula effectively since faculty are not prepared to each the multi-disciplines needed.  NSF funding would catalyze faculty training and reallocation necessary for institution-wide reform.  A private liberal arts and sciences college collaborating with a large public university will provide a broad base for assessment and dissemination of the program.",
