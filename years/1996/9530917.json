 "awd_abstract_narration": "9530917  Mohler         The aim of this research is to develop a new global  controllability and stabilization methodology for  multidimensional nonhomogeneous time-invariant bilinear systems  (BLS) with applications to large power transmission networks,  particularly Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS).       A through understanding of the qualitative behavior of a  dynamic system is the foundation of all the methods for  controllability and stabilization studies.  To this end, the  basis for this proposal is formed by a new method recently  introduced by the proposers to study the global qualitative  behavior of BLS.  Its core is a nonlinear decomposition technique  converting the study into the analysis of the qualitative  behavior of a finite number of the corresponding \"basic\"  uncontrolled systems. The work assumes the unboundedness of  (otherwise finite) control.  One of the goals of this proposal is  to refine this technique and to distinguish the conditions under  which the goal controllability can be achieved (in infinite time)  by bounded finite controls (which is the main practical  requirement).  The intent here is to focus on the 3-D case and to  give its complete solution in terms of eigenvectors and  eigenfunctions of the matrices involved.       In turns out that the aforementioned qualitative method fits  quite nicely to the analysis of some multidimensional nonlinear  dynamic systems controlled via multipliers (coefficients),    9530917  including large power transmission networks. The latter systems  are of great practical importance and were the subject of  intensive studies for numerous researchers and practical  engineers from the turn of the century. On the other hand, in  relation to the topic of this proposal, mostly additive damping  and local controllability were considered. The emphasis of this  proposed research is given to the global aspects of reachability  and controllability, and stabilization (these are closely  related) via multipliers/coefficients. This  type of control  structure is motivated by numerous adaptive system applications  such as FACTS, which play an important role in enhancing dynamic  performance of modern power systems and can increase transient  stability margins.  To our knowledge, very little is known about  the questions which this proposal addresses.       The research proposed here can be split into two parts.  We  start, on the other hand, with the analysis making use of  unbounded controls as traditionally assumed unavoidable in  general global studies.  On the other hand, taking into account  that practical controls are normally finite and may be even of a  certain sign, we also introduce these assumptions for the  aforementioned unbounded controls.  The idea of this approach is  that if a global controllability/reachability/stabilization  result holds for unbounded (but finite, say nonnegative)  controls, then one can expect/show it to be true in the local  aspect (not necessarily small) for the real device of restricted  capability.  Yet it is of particular interest, however, to  distinguish, based on the proposed methodology, the cases when  the global result can be achieved by bounded controls.  ***",
