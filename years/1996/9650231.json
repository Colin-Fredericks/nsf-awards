 "awd_abstract_narration": "Introductory astronomy students frequently have difficulty connecting the theoretical knowledge presented in lectures with astronomical observations. Another difficulty is in making the connection between the `Copernican` view of astronomy, dominant in lecture courses, with the `Ptolemaic` view of the sky manifest to the Earth-bound observer. This course combines interactive planetarium simulations with telescopic observation in order to bridge these gaps in understanding. With modern technology, planetarium simulations are devised in which students mark significant events in the sky with light pens and trace out important sky motions. These movements are measured against simulation time which is provided by computer to each student group. The astronomical observations emphasize simplicity and complement the planetarium simulations. The primary objective is to provide students the means to connect a thorough observing experience with the wealth of astronomical knowledge presented in the companion lecture course. The techniques and instrumentation developed are readily transferable to other institutions.",
