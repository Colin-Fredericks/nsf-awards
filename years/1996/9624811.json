 "awd_abstract_narration": "9624811, PI-Hrabak:  Trichomes of Arabidopsis are differentiated epidermal cells found on leaves and petioles, stems or bolts, and sepals.The development of Arabidopsis trichomes has been studied genetically by the isolation of mutants blocked at different steps in the developmental pathway. Two of the early genes in this pathway (GL1 and GL2) have been cloned and encode putative regulatory proteins containing a myb DNA binding motif and a homeodomain motif respectively. The expression pattern of GL1 and GL2, as assessed by promoter-GUS fusions or in situ hybridization studies, is very similar to the expression pattern observed with GUS fusions with the gene that is the subject of this proposal, CPK2. CDK2 is an isoform of the family of calmodulin-domain protein kinases. The hypothesis here is that CPK2 is involved in determination of epidermal cell fates or in the process of trichome development. The following questions will be addressed to test this hypothesis: Is CPK expressed in trichome mutant backgrounds? Does increasing or decreasing the amount of CPK2 mRNA and protein affect trichome developmen t? Other isoforms of CPK genes have been cloned but there is a lack of information on their function. The above studies may help provide clues to function for one member of this family.",
