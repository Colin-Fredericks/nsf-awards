 "awd_abstract_narration": "9602259  This award renews support for a Research Training Group in  Signal Transduction at Iowa State University first  established in 1991.  During the term of this second award ,  NSF support will be phased out; it is expected that other  sources of funding will be secured during this period. The  13 member faculty group is a mixture of outstanding senior  and junior investigators who come from a variety of  disciplinary backgrounds, but share a common interest in  intra- and extracellular signal transduction.  In its  initial year, the renewal award will provide stipends for  graduate students and postdoctoral trainees at levels  similar to the previous award and, in combination with  institutional funds will significantly increase the number  of undergraduate students sponsored for a summer research  program. and will defray part of the cost of the trainees'  research.  In addition, funds will be used to bring  outstanding investigators from other research and academic  institutions to the campus for seminars and symposia.  Signal transduction within and between cells is fundamental  to all types of cells and plays a crucial role in normal  cell development and function.  Examples of signal  transduction might include the cell-cell interactions  involved in development and function of the nervous system,  and the molecular mechanisms by which extracellular signals  effect temporary or permanent changes in the metabolism,  gene expression or structure of individual cells.  Typically, studies of signal transduction are directed at  any of a number of levels of cell organization, from the  atomic to the organismal.  The faculty participating in this  training group study a variety of organisms using a variety  of biophyisical and molecular biological techniques.  By  integrating their research programs and training activities  in these various areas, the group promotes a cross  fertilization of intellectual and experimental approaches  that should provide a superb experience for faculty and  s tudents alike.  ***",
