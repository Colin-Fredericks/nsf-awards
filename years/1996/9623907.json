 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this Career Development plan is the development of a new broad-based  program in the design of integrated analog systems at Northeastern University.   The research component of this plan involves the development of analog processing  circuits to be used in integrated circuits containing arrays of sensors or  display elements.  The main focus of this research is on applications related to  electronic imaging.  The two main thrusts are; (1) to develop high quality  imaging arrays with CMOS technology and (2) to devise focal-plane computational  imagers for extracting useful information from the image data.  The functions  performed by the focal plane processors, which include temporal and spatial  differencing and spatial filtering, will have applications in fields ranging from  image compression and enhancement to machine vision problems such as tracking and  inspection.    The educational component of this plan addresses the need to interest and train  more engineers in the field of analog design.  The major initiatives of this plan  include developing an extended analog design project for second and third year  undergraduates; incorporating more undergraduates into on-going research;  creating a seminar series bringing outside speakers on campus to increase  students' awareness of the importance of analog design in real world systems; and  developing an advanced graduate course in analog systems aimed both at our  graduate research students as well as at engineers in industry who need to deepen  their understanding of design principles and techniques.",
