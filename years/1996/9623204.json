The EWING is a 230'  general purpose research vessel with specialized capability in  marine geology and geophysics.  The vessel is owned by the National  Science Foundation and operated by Lamont-Doherty through a 5-year  charter agreement.  The EWING is capable of operating world wide  and will support cruises in the south Pacific Ocean and the north  Atlantic Ocean in 1996.  The ship is scheduled for 319 operational  days in 1996, of which 315 are in support of NSF-sponsored marine  geology and geophysics programs.        This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National Science  Foundation in support of oceanographic research.  Most  oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment and  extensive support from the ship's crew members.  Increasingly  research projects require equipment which must be permanently  installed on the vessel, thus requiring specialized vessels.  These  vessels do not operate the same as general cargo/fishing vessels,  therefore NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels  specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated  by universities and research institutes around the country.     ***",
