 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  Thole  9624591    This work was awarded under the CAREER program and includes objectives for both research and education. The research plan addresses the effects of free-stream turbulence on turbine blade heat transfer.  Experimental study of a up-scaled version of a first row stator vane will yield information on the flow field and the heat transport.  Optimization of film cooling of the turbine blade, using both numerical simulation and experimental measurements will then follow.    The educational plan includes recruiting women engineering students, retaining women engineering students and restructuring courses in the thermal sciences area.  Seminars at rural high schools in southern Illinois will be aimed at attracting women and at informing guidance counselors of opportunities in engineering. In addition, an optional all-women engineering design course will be offered at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.",
