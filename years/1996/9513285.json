Trowell of  the Australian CSIRO Division of Entomology, Black Mountain  Laboratory, in Canberra.  The focus of the research is on  technology transfer gained in the analysis of Drosophila  cytochrome P450 to the economically important pest Helicoverpa,  species of which show P450 mediated resistance to pyrethroid  insecticides.    The more specific objectives of this collaborative study are: 1)  to document cytochrome P450's role in insecticide resistant  strains of Drosophila; 2) to clone homologous P450's from  resistant strains of Helicoverpa; and,  3) to examine the role of  resistance conferring P450's from both Helicoverpa and   Drosophila in insecticide metabolism following functional  expression of recombinant clones.  The budworm, Helicoverpa, is  the primary pest of cotton in both the United States and  Australia.  The pest is currently being controlled using  pyrethroids, but the mechanism of pyrethroid resistance is not  known.  This collaborative study aims to define the precise  mechanisms of pyrethroid metabolism in resistant strains in order  to look for selective P450 inhibitors or synergists, and to  enable a rational choice of effective pyrethroid compounds and  alternative pesticides.  The collaboration is supported in   Australia through the Department of Industry, Science and  Tourism (DIST).",
