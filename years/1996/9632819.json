 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632819  Huber  This project will prepare and characterize supercooled hydrogen  in small volumes.  Molecular hydrogen is a composite boson,  lighter than helium, for which a superfluid phase has been  predicted if the material can be supercooled below 5 K.  Experiments will be conducted to prepare supercooled hydrogen  micro volumes and study them by spectroscopic techniques.  The  work is of general interest since bosonic materials display  unusual behavior such as superconductivity or Bose-Einstein  condensation, as well as superfluidity.  The challenge in this  project is to supercool molecular hydrogen substantially below  its crystallization temperature of 13.8 K.  Hydrogen in  microporous media and unsupported clusters of hydrogen will be  investigated.  The research is of fundamental interest in  condensed matter and materials physics.  %%%  This project deals with molecular hydrogen confined to small  volumes as in aerosol droplets or in microporous media.  When so  constrained, the hydrogen is more likely to supercool.  If  supercooled hydrogen liquid can be obtained at temperatures below  5 K, theoretical arguments suggest that a superfluid state may be  obtained.  Achievement of molecular hydrogen in a new superfluid  state would represent a major discovery in condensed matter  physics.  This project will develop techniques to obtain micro  volumes of molecular hydrogen at low temperatures, study the  micro volumes by spectroscopic techniques, and search for  superfluidity of hydrogen in the microvolumes.  ***",
