The  project   emphasized   studies  of  novel   quasi-two-dimensional  electron  and hole systems with an additional degree of  freedom.  These  include  systems  which contain  two  or  more  layers  of  electrons   in   close  proximity  so  that  interlayer   Coulomb  interactions  are  strong,  and  electron  systems  in  aluminum-  arsenide  quantum wells where the conduction band  has  a  multi-  valley  degeneracy.  The additional degree of  freedom  in  these  structures is expected to lead to new collective states which  we  plan to probe via low temperature magnetotransport measurements.  %%%  An  experimental investigation of electron interaction physics in  quantum-confined semi-conductor hetero-structures will  be  made.  The  emphasis of the program is on both the fabrication, via  the  molecular  beam  epitaxy technique, and the electronic  transport  measurements  at low temperatures and high magnetic fields  where  electron  correlation  effects dominate.  The  proposed  systems,  name, novel high-quality electron and hole systems in selectively-  doped  gallium-arsenide/aluminum-gallium-arsenide hetero-junction  structures,  are  among  the  cleanest (lowest-disorder)  carrier  systems   available.  Such  structures  provide  a  crucial   and  important  test-bed for new many-body physics.  The  results  can  also  have  an  impact on the realization of  new  devices  whose  fabrication and/or operation is based on semiconductor structures  of similar type.  ***",
