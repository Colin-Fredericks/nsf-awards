 "awd_abstract_narration": "Borgens  9631560  Spinal cord injuries are devastating to those that survive  them, producing lifelong losses in important bodily  functions.  The loss of function is in part due to a break  in the nerve fibers from the spinal cord to the brain, and  those that carry impulses from the brain to various parts of  the body.  One possible means to restore this \"two-way\"  impulse conduction is to induce and guide the regeneration  of nerve fibers around or through the area of injury.  Such  regeneration does not normally happen in mammals, but occurs  naturally in other vertebrates, usually leading to  functional recovery after spinal cord injury.    A novel means to accomplish this task is to impose a weak  voltage across the injury site.  This approach arises from  very clear evidence that  the application of this electrical  field can both initiate and direct the growth of fibers;  this has been shown in studies of nerve cells grown in  culture, as well as in various \"whole animal\" studies (for  example in the spinal cord of primitive fish and guinea  pigs).  Nerve processes grow towards the negative pole, and  degenerate away from the positive pole of the applied  voltage.  Weak applied voltages may also induce a  predictable orientation of other cells important to the  injury process such as astrocytes, that form scar tissue in  the spinal cord, and macrophages, which also play a  prominent role in acute injury.  To be clinically useful, an  applied voltage must influence nerve processes projecting in  both directions within the spinal cord.  Since growth  response towards the negative pole are immediate, and  degenerative responses occurring at the positive pole occur  much later, the direction of the applied voltage can be  reversed every 15 to 30 minutes to produce nerve growth in  both directions.  This is called oscillating field  stimulation (OFS).  OFS has produced significant levels of  functional recovery in naturally injured paraplegic dogs in  veterinary clinical trials.  An implantab le OFS unit is now  in development for the first trial in human patients;  however, before human clinical trials may begin, more  information must be gathered on the effects of OFS in other  mammals.  Up to this point, experiments involving laboratory  rats and guinea pigs have been limited due to the large size  of the prototype OFS device.  In this study, the  investigators will use a recently developed miniaturized OFS  device, combined with a hand-held sensor to test the  function of the unit from outside the body, to determine the  mechanisms of action, target cells and critical aspects of  this new technology.",
