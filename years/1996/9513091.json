 "awd_abstract_narration": "9513091  Sellin  This award supports a three-year cooperative research  project between Prof. Ivan A. Sellin of the University of  Tennessee at Knoxville, and Prof. Yoshiro Azuma of the  Photon Factory, KEK National Laboratory for High Energy  Physics, Tsukuba, Japan.  The collaborators assembled also  include other faculty, postdocs, and graduate students from  the University of Tennessee as well as from the Photon  Factory, the University of Tokyo, and Meisei University.  Initially, the joint research will concentrate on  interpreting new data on the properties of multiply excited,  \"hollow\" atomic states of lithium and other simple atoms  resonantly excited by synchrotron radiation at the Photon  Factory, the first among which was obtained just before the  submission of the present proposal.  Subsequently, studies  of the corresponding photoelectron production and their  energy and angular distributions will be undertaken,  utilizing new time-of-flight spectrometers and a cylindrical  mirror analyzer equipped with position-sensitive detection  electronics and associated software newly developed at the  University of Tennessee. As it is anticipated that a  significant fraction of the proposed studies will be carried  out at the Brookhaven, Lawrence Berkeley, and Argonne  National Laboratories in the US in addition to further work  at the Photon Factory utilizing dye laser equipment recently  acquired there for use in joint laser- and synchrotron-  radiation excitation experiments, the objectives of the US-  Japan program in facilitating the exchange and transfer of  scientific knowledge through genuinely bilateral  international collaboration are likely.  ***",
