 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of South Alabama will conduct during the summers of  1996 and 1997 a series of four four-day hands-on workshops for two  and four-year college faculty on the appropriate use of the Texas  Instruments TI-85 and TI-92 graphics calculators in collegiate  mathematics.  Two of the workshops will take place during the  Summer of 1996 and two will be scheduled for the Summer of 1997.   The purpose of the workshops is to engage participants in  developing an intellectual framework for the appropriate use of the  graphing calculator in the study and teaching of precalculus,  calculus, differential equations, matrix theory and elementary  statistics. This will be accomplished both by having participants  work through material developed by the PIs and also by having  participants create their own materials. Upon completion of one of  these workshops participants will be able to:  1) make appropriate  use of the graphing calculator, and address the technical and  pedagogical issues such usage involves; 2) return to their home  institutions and take the lead in the appropriate introduction of  the graphing calculator into their curricula; and 3) help build a  coalition between two and four-year institutions so as to foster a  more coordinated effort in the teaching of collegiate mathematics  courses.",
