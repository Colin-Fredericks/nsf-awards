The  conference,  to be held June 23-28, 1996 at the New  England  College  in Henniker, NH, is organized by Margaret B.  Stern  of  MIT Lincoln Laboratory (Chairman) and John N. Randall of  Texas   Instruments  (Chairman-Elect).    The   science   of  nanostructure  fabrication  is vital  not  only  to  today's  information  revolution but to the  fields  of  imaging  and  manipulation of chemical and biological structures.   Future  progress  in  all these disciplines is paced by advances  in  the  science and technology of nanofabrication that will  be  discussed  at this conference.  The conference  format  -  a  week  of continuous interaction with experts in interrelated  fields   in  a  casual  setting -  provides  a  particularly  rewarding  opportunity  for graduate  students  to  exchange  ideas  with  and  to  learn from this gathering  of  leading  researchers.  %%%  This  award  integrates  science and education  by  enabling  graduate  students  to  interact  directly  with   forefront  researcher in the field of nanostructure fabrication.  ***",
