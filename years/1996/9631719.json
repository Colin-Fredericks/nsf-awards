 "awd_abstract_narration": "9631719  Petersilia  Public opinion polls have indicated that the public's fear of crime is rising and people are taking behavioral precautions to avoid being victimized by serious crime. According to police reports, gang-related crime is also escalating and becoming more violent. However, crime rates are not increasing at a level to warrant the degree of fear currently being seen in the public. This research proposes to study the congruence between levels of gang-related crime, community characteristics (i.e., social and physical \"disorder,\" community decline, racial heterogeneity) and the public's fear of gangs in Orange County, California. Methods will include analysis of officially-recorded crime statistics, focus group discussions on the fear of gangs, and videotaping of actual community characteristics which may predict gang-related fear (e.g., graffiti the presence of loitering youths). At the completion of the project, there will likely be a deeper understanding of the factors that drive fear of crime, and the research will likely have immediate theoretical and practical importance. Specifically, it will attempt to further refine the four dominant theories in the fear of crime literature and will inform those who are attempting to devise sensible justice policies.  %%%%",
