 "awd_abstract_narration": "A group of faculty in the Departments of Ecology and Evolutionary  Biology (EEB), Molecular and Cellular Biology and Biochemistry (MCB)  and Molecular Pharmacology and Biotechnology (MPB) at Brown Uliversity  seeks funds for the purchase of an Applied Biosystems, Inc. ABI 377  Automated DNA Sequencer and dedicated thermal cycler for use with the  ABI 377. This equipment will be operated as a multi-user facility with  four major users (Hawrot, Hendrickson, Rand, Zaret) and eight minor  users (Biggins, Cane, Gerbi, Landy, Marshal, Mowry, Wessel, Wharton).  The research conducted with this Sequencer ranges from the analysis of  mutants of known genes (Biggins, Cane, Hawrot, Landy, Mowry, Wharton,  Zaret) to the characterization of new genomic sequences (Cane, Gerbi,  Hendrickson, Marshal, Wessel Wharton) to studies of genetic variation  and evolution of well-characterized loci (Rand). This piece of  equipment will provide a significant increase in research productivity  and competitiveness as each of the users currently does sequencing by  \"hand.\" At present, there is no automated DNA sequencer at Brown  University, nor in the entire state of Rhode Island. For most of the  major users, acquiring the DNA sequence of cloned or amplified genes is  a major burden to research progress. A substantial proportion of  sequencing effort falls on the shoulders of graduate students. Hence,  an automated DNA sequencer will have a significant impact on graduate  education by allowing students to focus on more intellectually  challenging research and direct more effort towards creative  experimental design. Brown University will provide 48.8% of the funds  for the purchase of the ABI 377, and will pay the salary of the staff  member (Charles Setterlund) who will be the dedicated person  responsible for operating this equipment.",
