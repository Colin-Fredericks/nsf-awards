Very little is understood about the social, economic and industrial implications of this societal transformation effecting virtually everyone.  Research is necessary to provide information in the innovation, design, evaluation and support of product and services, provide guidelines to user organizations in the adoption, investment and application decisions; and data of value to policy makers in guiding and controlling this explosive growth.  This planning grant is studying the economic viability of forming an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Information Technology and Organizations at the University of California, Irvine.    The research projects to be proposed for industrial support in the proposed Center are:  Online Information Resources and Interorganization Relationships; Computers and Multimedia: The Impact on American Households; Business Value of Information Technology; A Cost-Benefit Investigation of Groupware Usage by Financial Statement Auditors; Information Technology and Organizational Form; Enhancing End User Computing for Knowledge; Mapping Organizational Memory; Deployment of IT for Competitive Advantage; Scheduling and Patters of Meetings in large Organizations; High-Level Requirements Analysis for Information Systems Design.",
