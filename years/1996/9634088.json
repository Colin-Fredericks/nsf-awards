 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louisiana Systemic Improvement Program (LaSIP) proposes to capitalize on its first five years of NSF funding, by aligning recent reform projects with LaSIP goals and strategies.  New reform efforts include the Learn Commission, and a USDE Technology Challenge award.  LaSIP will use its position of strong influence in the stateOs educational framework to implement systemic reform strategies at the local district level, through the auspices of local Learn Commission funding and the networking capabilities operationalized by the Challenge award.    LaSIP will further its inroads into the stateOs reform of education by continuing and expanding its professional development opportunities for teachers and administrators; by providing guidance for local curriculum development; and by changing the way teacher education is structured in the state.  Local efforts will focus on leadership development among teachers; working with teams of teachers and administrators; and using professional societies and organizations as the bridge between state curriculum frameworks, and the development of local curricula.    The initiative will deploy its efforts through 8 Regional Partnership Initiatives, which will be determined through a competitive grant process, as well as the traditional and expanded professional development activities through a competitive grant process.  ***",
