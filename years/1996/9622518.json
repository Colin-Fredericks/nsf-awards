 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMI-9622518      Malshe         Chemical Vapor Deposited (CVD) diamond deposition has enhanced the operating performance  of many existing technological systems for the electronics, optical, computer and mechanical industries.  Previously, energy sources such as ions, abrasive, and chemical was considered for post-synthesis finishing and machining of CVD-diamond films.  These techniques inevitably lead to contamination and damage to the surfaces and subsurface layers as residual stresses, chemicals residues, and defects.  Many of these techniques were based on applying a solid, liquid, or gas polish directly on the substrate.  The results of these techniques are slow, thereby resulting in damage and deterioration.          This research develops and investigates a novel femtosecond (fs) pulse laser processing  technique for ultrafine machining of CVD-diamond films and other CVD-diamond based components.  The investigators proposes that the right combination of ultraviolet (UV) wavelength, pulse width, and processing environment with this novel approach will not only refine existing laser-processing techniques, but also surpass all other existing processing techniques in their physico-chemical machining performances.  The research task is in collaboration with the Iowa State University.",
