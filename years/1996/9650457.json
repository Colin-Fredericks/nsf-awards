 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project represents an effort to integrate basic technical equipment to furbish a photo-optical lighting and electrical systems laboratory. This laboratory is the physical resource needed to provide the experiential aspect of a recently established Illumination Engineering minor which is open to all majors in the College of Engineering.   The new laboratory enables more than 700 students, over the next 5 years, to become proficient with the latest technology in lighting systems measurement, control techniques, and design modeling. It also serves as a resource for a network of participating community colleges.   Recent Federal and state studies indicate that lighting accounts for 30 percent of all energy consumed annually in the United States. About 50 percent of this energy is wasted as a result of a work force that is improperly educated with respect to the recent dynamic advances in light sources, control systems, luminaires, and corresponding computer-assisted design technologies. The National Energy Policy Act, as well as State Acts, has mandated that energy-saving equipment and energy management systems be implemented in the near future. However, lighting education availability is extremely limited.   The department has enlisted the cooperation of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Lighting System Research Division to design a unique modular workstation laboratory, recommend equipment, and design experiments and projects.",
