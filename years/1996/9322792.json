 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9322792  Lally      This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop new structural-acoustic sensors and improved control strategies which will result in active control systems which are more efficient, have greater reliability, better global noise reduction capability and are less costly than present systems.  While the past two decades have seen striking progress in active control technology, commercialization of active systems has been hindered by the performance of  the \"working end\" of the active system: the sensors and actuators. This research will develop, test and demonstrate an acoustic intensity sensor and acoustic impedance probe in an active panel.   The key to the anticipated advancements is the ability of these new sensors to obtain real-time measurements of structurally-radiated sound power. To facilitate communication of sensor arrays and improve system reliability, smart electronics will be developed and incorporated into the sensors as an IC micro-chip.  Automobiles, trucks and aircraft which incorporate such active control systems can be quieter, lighter and more fuel efficient than today's vehicles. The sensors also have important applications in engineering test laboratories. Used as a design tool, the sensor measurements will enable engineers to design quieter automobiles, appliances, fans, compressors, air conditioners and other machinery.  Architects can use the design technology to improve the acoustics of concert halls, lecture halls, meeting rooms and auditoriums.  ***",
