The technique used is electrostatic  charging,  in  which  the  carrier density is changed electrically in  a  field-  effect  transistor-like structure without  introducing  disorder,  lattice   distortion  or  a  structural  phase  transition.   One  objective of the project is to induce superconductivity  in  high  temperature superconducting cuprate samples which are  originally  not  superconducting and study the carrier density dependence  of  the  insulator-super-conductor  phase  transition  and  transport  properties  in this process. A long-term goal of this project  is  to  establish electrostatic charging as an important tool in  the  research  of  doping  effects in perovskite  oxide  systems  with  strong electron-electron correlations.  %%%  Metal  oxides  are a class of materials with a  wide  variety  of  novel  properties such as high temperature superconductivity  and  colossal  magneto-resistivity. Electron charge carrier doping  in  these  materials, in which electrons interact strongly with  each  other,  is  the  key  to the understanding of  these  properties.  However,  the  usual  approach  of  chemical  doping  is   always  accompanied   by   disorder   and  sometimes   structural   phase  transitions.  This  project studies the doping  effects  using  a  different  approach,  i.e.  the  electrostatic  charging,   which  changes  the  carrier  density electrically  without  introducing  other  effects.  One objective of the project is to  transform  a  nonsuperconducting cuprate sample into a superconductor by adding  charge  carriers  into  it. The long-term goal  is  to  establish  electrostatic  charging as an important tool in the  research  of  metal oxides with strong el ectron-electron correlations, which is  potentially  of  great scientific and technological  significance  for  advanced  superconducting  and  magnetoresistive  electronic  devices.  ***",
