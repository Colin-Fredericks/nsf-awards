 "awd_abstract_narration": "The number field sieve is the latest algorithm for factoring  integers into primes. The investigator will continue his research  into the speed of the number field sieve. The plan is first, to  study the precise distribution of certain vectors constructed in  the number field sieve; second, to  develop tools to analyze the  probability that vectors chosen from a  non-uniform distributimn  will be independent; third, combine these results to sharpen the  known heuristics for the time taken by the number field sieve.  The investigator will also consider various problems in  multiprecision arithmetic from a geometric viewpoint.  This  research falls into the general mathematical field of Number  Theory.  Number theory has its historical roots in the study of  the whole numbers,  addressing such questions as those dealing  with the divisibility of one  whole number by another. It is  among the oldest branches of mathematics and  was pursued for  many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within  the  last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse   applications in areas such as data transmission and processing,  and  communication systems.",
