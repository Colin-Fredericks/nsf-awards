 "awd_abstract_narration": "9624921  Law  The soaring increase in network traffic has overwhelmed the transmission  capacity of current communications systems that use electronic switches and  copper wires. The use of optical fibers, switches and modulators,  components of all-optical networks, could equalize not only this disparity  but also provide a gigantic increase in the speed of the information  superhighway. This proposal describes novel approaches to build these  optical components. All-optical switching and modulation enable one light  beam to control the orientation as well as intensity of another light beam,  and are hundreds of times faster than electronic processes. What is more, a  light beam can guide another light beam, which follows the guiding beam's  \"footprints\"-a process called light-induced waveguiding. These waveguides  are produced by special nonlinear waves called optical vortex solitons.  These solitons are peculiar vortex-like pulses that retain their shape and  height after traveling long distances. Vortex solitons form in  selfdefocusing Kerr nonlinear media when their tendency to spread  (diffraction) is counterbalanced by their ability to change the refractive  index of the media (Kerr nonlinearity). Recent experiment has demonstrated  the light guiding capability of vortex soliton in this kind of medium.  Optical transistor effect is another recent experimental result that  reveals the potential application of vortex solitons in optical switching  and modulation. Manipulating the size of a vortex soliton, another light  beam (gate signal) can control the guiding efficiency and sensitivity of  light-induced waveguide. As a result, a guided beam is modulated as well as  amplified by the gate and guiding beams. The proposed study will establish  the theoretical basis for light-induced waveguides, modulators and switches  as well as simulate their actions computationally. Particularly, the  propagation dynamics of vortex solitons in a CW laser beam as well as in a  laser pulse will be investiga ted. This study will concentrate on the  interactions among vortex solitons themselves as well as vortex solitons  with other light pulses. These interactions are crucial to practical  applications, such as optical interconnections. Vortex solitons not only  have tremendous application potential, but also constitute a new frontier  for the exploration of vortex physics. This may lead to discovery of novel  phenomena that will find applications in other areas. The outcomes of this  project will result in a general simulation package for designing nonlinear  devices. Simulation results will be verified by various numerical methods  as well as experimental data provided by co-works at Worcester Polytechnic  Institute, Naval Research Laboratory and Wright Laboratory.    A well-balanced education for engineering students should consist of  computational and experimental training. One of the proposed educational  activities involves the use of computer as a tool for learning and  communication in the undergraduate Electromagnetics class. Computer can  enlighten students on those abstract theories by presenting results on  visual display. As a communication tool, computer becomes another channel  for a two-way discussion between an instructor and students. This will be  achieved by setting up an electronic bulletin board and a home page for the  class. The role of computer in graduate research is even more sign)ficant.  Graduate training will include extensive exposure to different numerical  techniques and development of analytic sense. Graduate student, as a  researcher, should be capable of searching for information and  disseminating research results timely. Again graduate students will receive  in-depth training on using computers for communication.    For experimental training, a graduate student exchange program will be set  up with Worcester Polytechnic Institute which has a nonlinear optics  laboratory with state-of-the-art equipment. At UWM, an optics laboratory  will be set up for three opti cs courses-optical communication, laser and  nonlinear optics-with the help of graduate students who participate in the  exchange program. This laboratory will also be used to verify numerical  results for the research project. Experiments for the three courses will  focus on practical issues and design techniques as well as current research  topics. The list of experiments will be updated to keep abreast with  technology.    The proposed optics laboratory will be a magnet for attracting students to  involve in optical research. The intent of the experiments in the three  optics courses is to introduce research activities to undergraduate  students. Computational training is another component in the proposed  research and education plans. Computer will be used heavily as  communication tool and learning aid for both education and research.  ***",
