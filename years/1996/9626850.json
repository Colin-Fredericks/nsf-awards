The main goal of this work is to examine and  develop a sliding mode control for its application to civil  structures.  The mathematical structure of this method  permits its application to linear and non-linear systems.  To this end several basic research question will be  addressed analytically and experimentally by the project  which is divided into several tasks.  The first task is to  develop optimal sliding mode controllers, including  frequency shaping and frequency domain approaches, both for  linear and non-linear systems; next task is to integrate  active control; and finally to verify experimentally the  developed control algorithms.  Results from this research  will lead to the development of experimentally verified  active and semi-active control methods to be applied to  civil structures for improving their performance and safety  under seismic and wind forces.  ***",
