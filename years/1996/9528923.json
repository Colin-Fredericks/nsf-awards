 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Stuart A. Rice is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his studies of quasi-two   dimensional systems.  Rice will use a combination of theory and   experiment to perform studies of: 1) polymer spheres and dimers in very   thin cells or adsorbed on liquid surfaces; 2) Langmuir monolayers; and 3)   the liquid-vapor interfaces of mixtures of metals.   Experimental   techniques to be employed include evanescent wave dynamic light   scattering, digital video microscopy, and  grazing incidence X-ray   diffraction and X-ray reflectivity.  Simulations will involve the use of   Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo techniques as well as Car-Parinello   theory.   Very little is known about the structure of the interface between two   immiscible phases.  Many chemical and biological phenomena depend on the   nature of this interface.  For example, the interface between long chain   amphiphiles and water is a model for biological membranes found in the   cell wall. Rice is using a combination of theoretical and experimental   methods that have only recently become available to explore the detailed   structure of these phase boundaries and the factors that influence their   structure.",
