 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project improves the curriculum of biology courses by establishing an innovative system of Mycobacterium classification that uses a modern method of statistical analysis based on the fatty acid content.  This system, which uses the liquid chromatograph, is being linked to the local network in order to service a greater number of students.  The project introduces a new Mycobacterium characterization method, updates the chromatographic techniques in the Microbiology Laboratory, and increases the knowledge and skills of the biology students through the practical operation of high-technology instruments.  The teaching-learning process can be improved because the results can be more precise and the student can be more involved in the analysis, evaluation, and application of the results.  These objectives can be achieved through the design and development of new experiments that improve the biology courses affected by the project.   The utilization of the liquid chromatograph system and the related software for the biochemical analysis of micro-organisms can be duplicated in other undergraduate settings.  The new experiments can help the students acquire and/or improve the following skills:  (1) relating structures and chromatographs, (2) analyzing statistical data and using the system, (3) managing and operating the chromatograph, (4) comprehending the complex nature of the components of micro-organisms, and (5) learning new taxonomic criteria based on molecular composition.  The courses that the new technology benefits, in terms of their curricular content, are General Microbiology, Cellular and Molecular Biology, Medical Biology, and Research Methods.",
