 "awd_abstract_narration": "The core of the present project is a focused, in-depth  comparative study of tone and associated prosodic phenomena in a  number of Kwa languages of Ivory Coast, with Baule at the center  of the investigation. In joint work on Baule over the past year,  the investigators have uncovered new evidence for two prosodic  constituents that have already received much attention in the  literature, the prosodic word and the phonological phrase.  Several tonal puzzles were solved by positing prosodic domains  that were independently justified on the basis of a variety of  other facts in the language. The resulting framework provides a  much better motivated analysis than other devices that are  commonly used.    The project directors expect that the effects of the project will  extend to the following areas:    Prosodic Phonology  The comprehensive coverage of eight related languages promises to  provide clear, empirically motivated definitions of the prosodic  domains.    Comparative Kwa   The data, because they will be gathered in a well coordinated  fashion from several dozen dialects of the eight languages to be  studied, promise to be of great use to comparativists.    Methodology  The project is expected to demonstrate the benefits of  cross-dialect and cross-language study for synchronic analysis.    Typology of tonal systems   The languages to be studied are full tone languages, with between  two and four phonological tones and complex tonal rules. They are  likely to shed further light on a variety of questions in the  theory of tone that previous investigations in West African  languages have asked.     Training of graduate students   A key component of the project is the training of linguists to  carry out research in their native language and related dialects  and languages.     Documentation of Ivoirian languages   The project will help to assure the continued survival of the  languages to be studied by creating a body of material that can  be drawn on in literacy-related and literary-related  work.",
