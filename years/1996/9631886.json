 "awd_abstract_narration": "Girls RISE (Raising Interest in Science & Engineering) is a model  program that will showcase how an informal, non-competitive  learning environment that includes hands-on, reality-based  applications of engineering principles and teamwork, can build  confidence and encourage girls to develop an interest in science,  engineering and mathematics and related careers.  Project  objectives are:  (1) to build competent, confident, enthusiastic  learners equipped with an array of advanced computer and technology  skills; (2) to expose girls to a variety of engineering careers  through interaction with professional women employed in science and  engineering related fields; (3) to increase girls confidence in  their ability to perform in traditionally male dominated technical  and engineering arenas while improving their problem solving and  information processing skills; (4) to foster sustained  participation in engineering-related studies, reducing the  attrition that occurs as girls move from the middle school to the  high school level.    The project builds upon the work the Miami Museum of Science  conducted with under-represented youth, and includes several key  components that have proven successful in related projects.  These  include:  the acquisition of advanced computer skills; the use of  college level mentors as instructors; interaction with  professionals in their workplace; project based, active learning;  and paid internships.",
