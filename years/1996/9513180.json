 "awd_abstract_narration": "9513180  Macalady      This award will partially support the travel of   Dr. Donald Macalady of the Department of Chemistry and  Geochemistry at the Colorado School of Mines to conduct   collaborative research with Prof. Keith Hunter, Department  of Chemistry, at the University of Otago in Dunedin,  New Zealand.  The research will focus on the role of natural  organic matter (NOM) as an electron transport mediator in a  variety of chemical reactions of natural and anthropogenic  substances.    The research will be guided by the hypothesis that NOM can serve  as a general electron transfer mediator for oxidation/reduction  reactions in aqueous systems and that the mechanisms of these  reactions involve a specific set of reaction centers within the  structure of NOH.  Southern New Zealand provides an excellent  environment for such investigations.  Few other locations provide  as many types of aquatic environments from pristine oligotropic  lakes through estuarine marshes to the oceanic environments  within short distances.  The combination of the experience of the  American investigator in redox chemistry of NOM and the interests  and facilities of the New Zealand collaborator are ideal for   conducting this multidisciplinary study.",
