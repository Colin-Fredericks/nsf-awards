Free, Department of Materials Science and  Engineering, University of Florida, and Drs. N.C. Chaudhuri,  Pradip of the Tata Research Development & Design Centre  (TRDDC), Pune, India.  The objective of this research is to  understand the basic mechanism involved in selective adsorption of  hydroxamate and fatty acid reagents in the iron oxide-titania  systems.  Physical and surface chemical characterization would  involve x-rays, SEM, pore size distribution and electrokinetic  measurements.  Adsorption, FT-IR and microflotation tests would  be conducted to identify the conditions for achieving the desired  separation.  Selectivity observed would be explained on the basis of  conditional stability constants, crystal structure specificity and  molecular orbital considerations.  It is expected that the  fundamental knowledge base generated in this study would be  useful in scientific design of reagent schemes for processing of low  grade complex ores.         Scope:  This project allows cooperation between two well known  scientists whose capabilities complement each other and who work  in institutions with complementary facilities for the proposed  research.  Dr. Moudgil is the director of the newly established  Engineering Research Center for Particle Science and Technology,  University of Florida.  He has published extensively, including  several co-publications with Pradip.  The collaboration with Dr.  Chaudhuri is new and likely to benefit both institutions.  This  project meets a number of important objectives of the Division of  International Programs, especially the inclusion of a postdoctoral  fellow and a new Indian participant in the collaboration.",
