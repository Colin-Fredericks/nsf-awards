Gordon Conferences have occurred for over 60 years and are important vehicles for fostering education and science among researchers with common interests in the fields of biological, chemical and physical sciences.  The specific aim of the conference on Molecular Evolution is to stimulate discussion and interactions among a broad spectrum of scientists interested in evolution at the molecular level.  The study of molecular evolution is fundamental to the life sciences and integrates research from molecular biology, genetics, developmental biology, cell biology, ecology, biochemistry, virology, biophysics, paleontology, biogeography, statistics, mathematics, computer science and medicine.  Twenty-nine invited speakers from North America, Europe and Japan will speak on topics as diverse as the origin and evolution of the AIDS virus, the mammalian Y chromosome, the evolution of gene networks, and mathematical models of change at the molecular level.  Gordon Conferences are noted for their capability to determine the direction of research in a given discipline for the next 5 to 10 years.",
