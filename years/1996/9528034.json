Many important technological advances are occurring in the  biophysical understanding of foods. This conference will help to  consider these advances by combining engineering fundamentals  with the basic principles of food science.  This will be  accomplished by inviting leading researchers in different areas,  including both industry and academia.  The program includes  sessions on: (1) the physical chemistry of foods, covering the  topics of emulsions and foams, protein adsorption,  physical/chemical properties, and moisture relations in foods;  (2) transport processes and unit operations, covering the topics  of rheology, frying/dehydration, extrusion, thermal and non-  thermal processing, and separations/packaging; and (3) innovative  food manufacturing processes, covering the topics of pilot plants  and scale-up, research in food engineering, innovative concepts  in food processing and manufacturing processes, and engineering  issues in food manufacture.  Participation at this conference  will be international and will include food engineers, food  scientists, chemical and biochemical engineers, food chemists,  and food microbiologists.  ***",
