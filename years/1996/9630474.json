 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630474  Karplus  A question central to flavoenzyme studies is how the binding  of FMN or FAD to various protein scaffolds controls the  redox potential and chemical reactivity of the flavin,  allowing it to catalyse an astounding diversity of  reactions.  High resolution structural information, combined  with extensive enzymatic and spectroscopic data is the most  effective way to gain insight into the mechanisms  controlling flavin reactivity.  This project extends studies  of recombinant forms of the flavoenzymes ferredoxin-NADP+  reductase (FNR), old yellow enzyme (OYE), and Mycobacterium  smegmatis lactate monooxygenase (LMO).  Studies on OYE  include high resolution analyses of the wild type and mutant  OYE structures and, in particular, determining how NADPH  binds to OYE and how much charge transfer interactions  contribute to ligand affinity.  Other studies include the  structural analyses of wild type and mutant forms of spinach  FNR, pea FNR and corn root FNR, as well as LMO.  %%%  Enzymes  which require riboflavin are widely involved in  metabilic processes.  A question central to understanding  these enzymes is how the binding of riboflavin derivatives  (FMN and FAD) to various protein scaffolds controls the  redox potential and chemical reactivity of the flavin, and  allows the catalysis an astounding diversity of reactions.  High resolution structural information, combined with  extensive enzymatic and spectroscopic data is the most  effective way to gain insight into the mechanisms  controlling flavin reactivity.  This project uses  crystallographic and other biophysical studies to further  the understanding of structure-function relations for the  flavin dependent enzymes ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase, old  yellow enzyme, and lactate monooxygenase.  ***",
