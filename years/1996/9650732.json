 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Physics Department offers several sections of an algebra-based introductory physics course to a total of about 200 students each semester. The course is taught using a traditional large lecture and separate lab format. Research has shown that this format is not effective in motivating students and producing significant learning results. This finding has led to the need to redesign the introductory physics courses. The purpose of these changes is to increase student comprehension, interest, and performance in introductory physics classes; better integrate labs and lectures; and tailor the class to the needs of the students' major fields of study.   Participants in this project are accomplishing these objectives by implementing a 'studio' instructional format. This format is an interactive instructional system based on networked computer workstations linked to a server controlled by the instructor. Between short lecture segments, students can perform experiments or run computer simulations at their desks. The instructors can videotape demonstrations, digitize the data, and pass those data directly to the students for analysis. For each physical concept, students at different workstations can study different applications relevant to their respective majors. The studio replaces traditional lectures and labs by combining both into a single learning experience.   Most technology programs and several science curricula require introductory algebra-based physics. Making it into an exciting discovery course, adapted to the students' respective fields of study, can have a great impact on many programs throughout the university. Software modules developed for this project can be disseminated through the Internet and possibly a workshop.",
