 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623808  Li    The purpose of this project is to examine several techniques  that can be employed in studying micromechanical  deformation.  Included within this group are the atomic  force microscope, continuous indentation testing, the  impression creep machine, and the scratch tester.  Continuous indentation testing experiments are employed as a  new technique to determine the adhesion strength between a  deposited thin film and the substrate, as well as measuring  Young's modulus and PoissonOs ratio of the film itself.  Impression creep machine tests of grain boundaries and  triple junctions in zinc are analyzed.  Scratch testing of  glass and polymers is performed to understand the stick/slip  process.  The atomic force microscope looks at shear bands  in amorphous metals (with a magnetic indenter) as well as  micro shear bands and crazes in polymers.  Continuous  indentation testing  of amorphous metals on the wheel side  and the air side are compared.  Theoretical analysis  involves finite element computation, analytical methods,  molecular dynamics and modeling of critical steps in all of  the tests.  The studies are aimed at answering questions  associated with the employment of these techniques and the  micromechanical deformation behavior of the selected  materials.  %%%  The results should impact techniques used for  micromechanical measurements, polishing and grinding of  glasses, and improved adhesion of thin films and coatings to  substrates.  ***",
