 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wake Technical Community College seeks National Science Foundation funding to expand the capstone project currently required in three engineering technology departments.  A capstone project demonstrating student skills will help resolve the problems of students graduating who are unable to integrate curriculum components into the high-tech workplace.  Today employers hire those capable of assimilating their technical and general education to perform with competence in the workplace.   Expanding the project from there A. A. S. curricula to 27 A. A. S. curricula demands revision and development of required courses to emphasize an integrated, practical approach to learning, one in which students are active participants in the educational process.  The objective of the reform initiative include :  (a) requiring a team of students to complete an applications-oriented capstone project, (b) integrating mathematics, engineering technology, science, and communications skills early in their education, (c) creating a partnership with workforce representatives to assure validity of the projects, (d) establishing an annual Presentation Day, (e) and collaborating with other community colleges to spread the initiative using the College's project as a model.  The reform effort will be evaluated at each stage including:  instructor evaluation of classroom performance, evaluation of each student team's written reports, evaluation of the team presentation, assessment of the program by graduates, and an evaluation of their training by employers.    The special features of the reform initiative include integrated, participatory approach to education culminating in the team presentation of the capstone project to an evaluation panel and to invited guests.  Additionally, integrating curricula early in a student's curriculum will provide a broad-based practical education.  Finally, requiring the capstone project as a culmination to the students' education will showcase their knowledge to their peers, instructors, admin istration, and prospective employers; it will also showcase the programs offered at the College.",
