 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extraordinary advances in speech coding have been achieved in the past few  years, with the ITU and digital cellular industries producing voice coding  standards for telephony and videoconferencing with performance perhaps  unimaginable even ten years ago.  At rates below 12 kbits/s, however, these  coders are sometimes criticized for their implementation complexity and for  their difficulty in coding speech in the presence of extraneous background  impairments.  The complexity issue is omnipresent, but becomes increasingly  important in the mobile communications environment, both in digital  cellular and emerging personal communications systems, where battery power  is a dominating issue. Furthermore, there are many applications being  developed and proposed for packet-switched videoconferencing at various  rates, where it is desirable to have voice coders implemented either wholly  in software on standard platforms (Macs, PCs, Sparcs) or whose  implementations do not usurp large portions of the capabilities of a DSP  chip.  Being able to code speech in the presence of background impairments  has always been of interest, but has recently moved to the fore because of  the mobile environments encountered in digital cellular mobile radio and  evolving personal communications systems.  Desktop applications also  present a challenge for coding with background impairments, since  hands-free interaction is critical and thus even some relatively quiet  office environments do not have the handset to aid in rejecting the  background noise.  The challenge is therefore to achieve communications  quality speech at 8 kbits/s with medium-to-low complexity for a variety of  implementation approaches without changing background impairments into  annoying artifacts. This research approaches this problem by starting with  a low delay waveform following coder, called a tree coder, removing the low  delay requirement and employing frequency domain based variable rate  techniques, forward adaptation ideas, code tr ee adaptivity innovations, and  improved perceptual weighting to reduce implementation complexity while  retaining reconstructed speech quality.",
