 "awd_abstract_narration": "Unprecedented growth in the use of molecular methods by the  ecology, population genetics, and plant molecular genetics  groups in Hull Gourt, representing three biology departments,  motivates this proposal for support of automated equipment for  DNA sequencing and molecular genotyping. This growth has been  propelled by three forces, the exciting scientific  possibilities made accessible with sequence data - many of  which are being charted for the first time by the proposed  users, technological innovations in automated sequencing, and  the strategic growth of the three biology groups at the  University of Chicago. To further enhance research excellence  and leadership, and to provide research training opportunities  we have developed a plan for a \"hands-on\" multi-user facility  that will contain equipment needed to carry out all steps in  DNA sequencing and genotyping. The facility will include two  new DNA sequencers and a workstation for automated sample  processing, in addition to an existing ABI 373A sequencer. The  facility will also have high capacity temperature cycling  machines for carrying out sequencing reactions, centrifuges,  and other equipment needed for this work. To accommodate the  requirements for data editing, statistical analysis and  database comparisons generated by the research, the facility  will house four Macintosh PowerPC and two Silicon Graphics  workstations. The computing speed afforded by these  workstations will assure the group's leadership in the rapidly  growing field of simulating molecular population genetics and  evolutionary processes. It will also promote the synergistic  interaction of complementing strengths - computation  (population geneticists) and informatics (molecular  geneticists). The facility will be managed by Dr. L-W Zen,  under the supervision of Dr. M. Kreitman and a three person  Instrument Policy Committee.      These modern instruments will have broad impact on the  University community. The 13 primary faculty users belong to  si x graduate training programs, and currently have 22  postdoctoral research associates, 39 graduate students, and 26  undergraduates working in their labs, including 34 women and  eight members of minority groups. The nine secondary users have  14 postdoctoral research associates, 28 graduate students and  13 undergraduates. All qualified users will have access to the  sequencing facility 24 hours a day. More than one hundred  undergraduates, over half of whom are women, will use the  instrumentation annually through required courses, independent  research, and other training opportunities. The University is  an NSF REU site, and also supports summer undergraduate  research with grants from Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the  Pew Foundation, and the Biological Sciences Division. The  Biological Sciences Division also participates in the Summer  Research Opportunities Program (SROP) and the DBS Minority  Summer Fellowship Program, both of which provide research  opportunities for minorities.      The use of naturally occurring DNA sequence variation in  the analysis of biological processes is a common theme that  unites the three areas of research represented by the primary  users - molecular population genetics, molecular ecology, and  plant molecular genetics. The ability to automate data  acquisition is leading to dramatic scientific advances in all  three areas of research, and at the same time is promoting  interdisciplinary interaction on an unprecedented scale.  Interdisciplinary research and graduate training have been  hallmarks of the University of Chicago's educational  philosophy. The recent growth of interdisciplinary evolutionary  genetics and ecology groups in the Department of Ecology and  Evolution, the creation of a developmental evolutionary  genetics group in the Department of Organismal Biology and  Anatomy, and the joint expansion of plant genetics by the  departments of E&E and Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology  (MGCB), all build on this philosophical foundation, and pro vide  strategic opportunities for innovative new research.      The successful recruitment of two senior faculty in  molecular evolutionary genetics by the E&E department several  years ago, M Kreitman and C-I Wu, have catalyzed the conversion  of research by other groups to incorportate molecular  approaches. At the same time, E&E has embarked on a strategic  plan to develop research excellence in ecology by recruiting  six faculty members, S PruettJones, M Leibold, E Simms, C  Pfister, T Wootton and J Bergelson. Several are using molecular  methods in their research, and J Bergelson's work is being  acknowledged as defining a new field of molecular ecology. At  the same time, MGCB has recruited into Hull Court two excellent  plant molecular geneticists, B Keith and D Preuss, and is  currently searching for a senior plant developmental  geneticist, who will also be housed in Hull Court. Crucial to  the fulfillment of research potential of these expanding groups  is the development of a Genotyping and DNA Sequencing Facility,  a point of convergence for all these research groups.",
