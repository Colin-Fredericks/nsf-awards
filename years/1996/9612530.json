 "awd_abstract_narration": "OCE-9612530    This NASA and NSF sponsored conference will explore ideas related  to Europa's possible ocean, submarine volcanism, and biological  activity.    Europa is one of the four large Galilean satellites of Jupiter.   Data and theory have suggested (though not proven) that Europa has  an ocean of liquid water beneath its icy crust.  Europa undergoes  tidal heating similar to that driving the spectacular volcanism on  the Jovian moon Io, and this heating may have been sufficient to  melt the ice and maintain an ocean.  Among the topics the  conference will address are geologic and geophysical evidence  concerning an ocean, and what its physical state might be.    If an ocean exists on Europa, the question of whether it could  support life immediately arises.  The first detailed examination of  Europa by the Voyager spacecraft (in 1979) coincided very closely  with the first detailed investigation by oceanographers of volcano-  hydrothermal sites on the Earth's seafloor.  That work has shown  that in the presence of liquid water, volcanoes can sustain life  without energy from the sun.  Submarine volcanism is also a  possibility on Europa.  A major purpose of the conference, then,  will be to examine critically the arguments for and against  submarine volcanism on Europa, and the likelihood that such  activity could support biological activity there as well.  A  related and controversial topic is the issue of whether life can  have originated at submarine volcanic systems, on Earth and on  planets in general.  The conference will bring together the  planetary science, oceanography, and exobiology communities to  explore these topics.    The conference, jointly supported by NASA's Solar System  Exploration Division (Exobiology Program Office) and NSF's Ocean  Science Program, will also deal with ongoing and future robotic  exploration of Europa.  The Galileo spacecraft is now in orbit  around Jupiter, and will make multiple flyby examinations of Europa  during its mission.  Follow-on missio ns could be flown to Europa  that would address the existence of an ocean in detail, and that  would explore the ocean the ocean if it were found to be present.   The conference will address the measurement techniques that could  be used on such missions, and their implications for further solar  system exploration.",
