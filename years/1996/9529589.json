 "awd_abstract_narration": "9529589  Cox    This U.S.-Polish Cooperative Research award will study  \"Electroanalytical Chemistry in the Absence of a Bulk Solution  Phase.\"  The principal researchers are Dr. James A. Cox of Miami  University, Ohio, and Dr. Pawel J. Kulesza of the University of  Warsaw.  The general goal of this program is to characterize  certain ionically-conducting solids in terms of their ability to  serve as media for electrochemical studies in the absence of a  contacting solution phase.  Of particular interest would be to  establish conditions where electrolyses of gas-phase components  can be performed at cells using these electrolytes under  conditions where the rates and mechanisms of the electrode  reaction are not influenced by concomitants in the gas phase.   The components of interest in this study are generally  electrochemically silent at conventional, bare electrodes, so the  investigation of catalysis in the environment of these solids is  a required part of this program.  The researchers will  investigate two general materials as solid electrolytes, glassy  substances prepared by sol-gel processes and polyoxometallate  powders.  The former will be xerogels with known or predicted  ionic conductivity such as polymeric vanadium, ruthenium, and  iridium oxides.  The catalysts will be in the form of surface  layers on electrodes coated with films of the xerogels or  dispersions with these films.  In addition, conversion of  selected xerogels into redox mediators by electrochemically  generating lower oxides of the metal centers will be explored.   Keggin-type heteropoly-12-tungstates will comprise the primary  polyoxometallates investigated.  The test systems will be  selected on the basis of formation of mixed-valent systems.  The  kinetics of electron self-exchange will be determined along with  the effective transport coefficient.  Once characterized, the  polyoxometallates will be encapsulated in xerogels.  Here, the  objective is to exploit the catalytic activity of the former in  an envi ronment that permits the selected redox reaction to  proceed without interference from other components, including  water, of the surrounding atmosphere.  The studies will be  performed with conventional electrochemical instrumentation,  including voltammetric and a.c. impedance methodology.  The  results of this investigation will guide the development of  amperometric sensors for hazardous components in air and for the  presence of targeted solids or liquids with finite vapor  pressures.  In addition, these electrochemical systems are  projected to be suited to purifying the atmosphere of small  environments.  Other possible applications include the design of  energy-storage devices and microscale electronic components such  as bilayer switches.    This research in chemistry fulfills the program objectives of  bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to  combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong  mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality,  reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.",
