 "awd_abstract_narration": "9554168  McLaren    This four-year project, sponsored by the National Center for  Atmospheric Research, teaches those teachers, primarily from grades  6-8, in seven selected rural school districts in Western Colorado,  the basic concepts of atmospheric science.  The project will start  out first with the district outreach component.  Then in the next  years of funding the project will bring 35 teachers (five from each  district) for three consecutive three-week summer workshops for  intensive content, pedagogical and leadership training.  The  workshops will increase the teachers' knowledge of the atmospheric  sciences and mathematics, enable them to develop aativity-based  teaching strategies, show them how to use current educational  technologies, increase their leadership skills and provide them  with laboratory and field experiences as they work with NCAR  scientists.  During the school year these teams of lead teachers  will work with 21 teachers in their district (for a total of 182)  to implement atmospheric science in the schools.  These lead  teachers will be aided by NCAR scientists, instructors from  Colorado's Science Discovery Program and the Annenberg/CPB Internet  training program.  The atmospheric science curriculum will be based  upon the materials developed by the original Project LEARN program  and includes modules entitled Atmospheric Dynamics, Ozone in Our  Atmosphere and Cycles of the Earth and Atmosphere.    Matching funds account for 51% of the NSF award.",
