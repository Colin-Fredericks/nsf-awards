 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630452  Kohn  This grant supports the work of  a senior, emeritus PI with  a long record of distinguished contributions to the theory  of materials.  The grant contains work in three different  areas: The first project contains further development and  applications of O(N) computational algorithms for general  many atom problems.  It also includes work on the inclusion  of Van der Waal's forces and of time dependent response in  the local density functional calculations.  In the second  part consists of the study of dynamics of Hamiltonian  systems subject to finite time-periodic perturbations.  The  third project includes continuation of PI's work on atom-  surface interactions and properties of Copper-Gold alloys at  finite temperatures.  %%%  This grant supports work by one of the founders of the  modern many-body materials theory.  After a wonderfully  productive career spanning over 40 year, the PI continues to  be an active participant in detailed research in many-body  theory.  The proposed work  includes further exploration and  application of sophisticated computational methods devised  recently by the PI.  It also includes a proposal to consider  a long-standing mathematical problem in the response of  systems to time dependent forces.  This work, like much of  the prior work  of the PI, is timely in bridging  the gap in  system sizes between small devices and the largest size that  the computers can reliably handle.  ***",
