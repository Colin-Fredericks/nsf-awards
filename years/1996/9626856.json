 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626856  Marker       In studying the real numbers with exponentiation, van den Dries,  Macintyre and Marker gave an algebraic construction of a nonstandard  model.  This model has proved useful in understanding the asymptotic  behavior of functions.  Marker's work concentrates on the relationship  between formally solving differential equations in this model and the  problem of finding actual solutions at infinity.  Marker will also  work on problems in the model theory of differential fields.  This is  a fascinating area, requiring a sophisticated mixture of ideas from  model theory, differential algebra and algebraic geometry.  (Through  the work of Buium and Hrushovski, differential algebra has had  significant number theoretic applications.)  Marker studies the  geometry of solutions to algebraic differential equations,  concentrating on the use of model theoretic dimensions to develop  intersection theory.       Model theory is a branch of mathematical logic where one studies  mathematical structures by looking at their properties expressed in  formal languages.  For example, in the real numbers one can say that  every number is a cube, but one cannot say that every bounded set has  a least upper bound.  Nonstandard models of the real numbers share all  their formal properties.  Studying nonstandard models often leads to  fresh insights into the real numbers themselves.  Recently, model  theorists have been studying the exponential function.  These  investigations have led to important new insights into the geometry of  solution sets of equations involving exponentials.  This work has  already found applications in analysis, control theory and neural  networks.  ***",
