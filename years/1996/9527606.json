 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kamb  Raymond  9527606    Abstract    This award supports a project to establish a Global Positioning  System geodetic network in the Transantarctic Mountains of  Antarctica to measure vertical and horizontal crustal velocities.  The vertical crustal velocities measured by GPS reflect the  viscoelastic response of the solid Earth to Antarctic  deglaciation.  Data from this GPS network will be used to test  models of late Pleistocene-early Holocene versus late Holocene  deglaciation of Antarctica.  These data will also constrain the  length of time over which the Antarctic ice sheet disintegrated,  and the distribution of the peak glacial load.  A mid-Holocene  deglaciation model produces a predicted uplift pattern in the  vicinity of the Transantarctic Mountains that can be measured by  high-precision GPS geodetic measurements within a time span of  four years.  Horizontal deformation induced by rebound will also  be measured. These data will also help constrain present-day  changes in Antarctic ice mass by monitoring the elastic  deformation of the lithosphere resulting from ongoing glacial  loading and unloading.  The lithospheric response to ongoing ice  mass changes is predicted to be an order of magnitude less than  the viscoelastic response to late-Pleistocene-Holocene  deglaciation.  Tectonic uplift rates are also predicted to be  very small compared to the predicted rebound signal for this  region.  Baselines across faults in the Transantarctics may  capture co-seismic motion if an earthquake were to occur, or  aseismic slip.   The first year of the project will be spent in  technology development for, and a proof-of-concept demonstration  of, a prototype autonomous GPS station (AGS) under joint funding  with JPL.  This prototype station will be powered by solar panels  and will collect data continuously during the deployment period.  Data transmission via long-range Radio Frequency (RF)  transceivers acting as modems will also be tested.  The prototype  station will be modified as neede d to implement a reliable,  operational network of four autonomous GPS stations in the  following year of the project, contingetn upon joint funding by  NASA.  The AGS network will send daily data reports McMurdo.  The  network will be a permanent installation that will continue to  monitor motion in the region beyond the term of this project.  Advanced processing techniques will be employed to increase the  accuracy of the crustal velocity measurements, especially for the  vertical component.  These include orbit modeling, troposphere  correction, ionosphere correction, and extraction of annual and  seasonal solid Earth and ocean tidal signals.",
