 "awd_abstract_narration": "This purpose of this project is to hold two conferences on the  state of empirical economics organized around chapters written  for Volume V of the Handbook of Econometrics, the empirical and  applied complement to the recently-published Volume IV.  The goal  of the volume is to provide an up-to-date account of views of  best practice empirical research in economics.  The target  audience is the applied econometrics community.  The first  function of this targeting is to improve the practice of  econometrics by demonstrating to this wider audience how advanced  methods of econometrics can be used to advantage to address real  problems.  The second function is to improve the theory of  econometrics by communicating to theorists what is working out in  practice, what is not, and what needs to be done.  These two  conferences are a very important step in achieving these goals.  Issues of judgment and interpretation always characterize  empirical research, and it is essential to have a dialogue that  will improve the quality of the papers in the published volume,  and that will allow dissenting views both at the conference and  in the published volume.",
