Blume  Earthquake Engineering Center, Stanford University.  The  table  which was built in 1972 has been in continuous use  for testing of variety of structures and components and  significant results have been obtained over that period of  time.  Many of the important components of the shaking table  facility have deteriorated while others have become  obsolete.    This project to modernize and upgrade key components of the  shaking table facility.  The replacement components to be  purchased and installed include: hydrostatic Bearings with  Suction Pump, and PC-Based Control System for Table  Programming and Data Acquisition.    The shaking table facility upgrading is a part of the on-  going University's program seismically to seismicaly  retrofit and expand the Center at a cost of $3.5 million.  This modernization is a unique opportunity to renovate and  update the key laboratory equipment, its shaking table,  consistent with CMS/ENG's concept and long-term plans to  upgrade and network the nation's earthquake experiment  research capability.  ***",
