 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9631589  Ban   PD-LD, Inc. in cooperation with the ATC/POEM (Advanced Technology Center/Princeton Opto Electronic Materials) of Princeton University, has recently developed a totally new method for the growth of thin films of complex organic compounds, called Organic Vapor Phase Deposition, OVPD. This new method was successfully used to deposit thin films of chemically pure DAST, a material with optical nonlinear properties among best reported.   On the basis of these results, PD-LD, Inc. with its President, Dr. Vladimir S. Ban as the Principal Investigator and ATC/POEM with its Director, Professor Stephen R. Forrest as the Chief Adviser, propose to develop a prototype fiber optic modulator, based on thin films of DAST deposited by OVPD on a silicon optical bench configured for efficient coupling to optical fibers.           This proposal addresses for the first time the integration of waveguides of highly non linear organic materials with silicon optical benches, which might be populated with standard fiber optic components, such as laser diodes, detectors, optical fibers, etc. Thus, this proposal represents an important step toward the fully integrated optoelectronic integrated circuits (OEIC), where different materials will be combined for the optimal performance of various functions, such as light generation, light guiding, light modulating and light detection.    ***",
