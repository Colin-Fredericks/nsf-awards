 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1994, the The International Society for Plant Molecular  Biology's Commission on Plant Gene Nomenclature (CPGN)  opened a Registry of Sequenced Plant Genes to serve as an  international clearing house for reviewing and assigning  gene designations for sequenced plant genes.  The  nomenclature developed by the CPGN is based on the  function of gene products and is common across the plant  kingdom. The project has been supported with funds from  the USDA and from the European Commission which  underwrites the operations of the CPGN in Europe,  including a Registry Office in Norwich, UK. The \"Mendel\"  database implemented in the ACEDB database management  system is currently accessible over the WWW at:  http://probe.nalusda.gov:8300/.    In this project, the International Society for Plant  Molecular Biology through the CPGN will continue to  provide standardized common designations for sequenced  plant genes and to re-evaluate the technology support  infrastructure for the project.  Advisory committees of  scientific users and of bioinformaticians will undertake a  needs analysis, the production of a data model and design  planning for the project in order to increase the level of  automation and efficiency of data acquisition and  verification.  The current system of collecting data in a  flat file system will be examined and re-implemented based  on the recommendations of the technical and scientific  advisory committees. The specific objectives of the  project are to: 1) Expand the system of working groups to  include all shared categories of plant genes plus certain  categories of special scientific, industrial, or  pharmaceutical importance, 2) Develop plant-wide  designations for 4,000 plant-wide families of genes by the  end od 1999. These designations will correspond to 90  percent of all isolated plant genes and for most genes  expected on the basis of known proteins and metabolic  pathways, 3) Re-design Mendel from its present system of  linked flat files to a single database on the A CEDB  platform (http://probe.nalusda.gov:8000/acedocs), 4)  Organize a system for reciprocal updates of Mendel between  the American and European registry offices of the CPGN and  5) Organize an on-line, real-time system of communication  with EMBL/GenBank.",
