 "awd_abstract_narration": "9631040  O'BRIEN    In order to fully comprehend a text, the reader must be able to  understand continually how each currently read sentence fits with  the information presented earlier in the text.  This often  involves recognizing connections between sentences that are  currently being read and information that occurred much earlier  in the text.  Readers are generally able to make these kinds of  connections quickly and easily, even when the related ideas span  relatively large distances in the text.  This research will  investigate the processes involved in relating and connecting  each new idea to what has been read before.  Specifically, the  research will test a computer simulation model which assumes that  these processes are largely automatic, that is, occurring quickly  and with very little effort on the part of the reader.  The  research will also test the model's predictions about factors  that influence the kinds of connections readers are likely to  make and how those connections influence their understanding and  memory of the text.  Such factors include readers' goals and  perspectives, the organization of the text, the syntax of the  sentence being read, the nature of the relation between currently  read ideas and related information read earlier, the distance  between currently read ideas and related information, and the  extent to which the text elaborates upon various topics.   Although the primary goal of the research is to test a model of  how readers understand and remember text, another important  result of the research will be a better understanding of the  factors that make texts easier to understand and remember.  Such  an understanding should prove helpful in writing textbooks and  manuals that present information clearly, and in a way that  improves readers' memory for the most important points.    ***",
