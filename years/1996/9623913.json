 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  research  addresses object recognition from  controlled  industrial  environments to less restricted  domains.   This  will  require  object  representation that  can  encode  the  prototypical shape of an object without requiring its  exact  geometry.  Furthermore, object recognition is not  a  single  isolated task, but rather a complex interaction of a set  of  closely-related behaviors, including both bottom-up and  top  down    recognition,   localization,   active   recognition,  quantitative shape recovery, and object tracking.  Not  only  must  these  individual problems be  solved,  they  must  be  integrated within a common representational framework, since  a  complex  recognition task may involve  rapid  transitions  from  one behavior to another.  Earlier research in the PI's  laboratory  began with the introduction of  a  novel  object  representation      integrating     object-centered      and  viewercentered models, this representation, a  probabilistic  partbased  aspect hierarchy, has formed the  foundation  for  novel  approaches to each of the above recognition problems.  The  new  research will extend the work along each of  these  behaviors,  supporting  their application  to  more  complex  domains,  including that of visual aids for the disabled  as  well  as  content-based image retrieval.  In addition,  this  research will address the task of determining, for  a  given  set  of  3-D objects, the decomposition of the objects  into  parts which is optimal in terms of recognition performance.",
