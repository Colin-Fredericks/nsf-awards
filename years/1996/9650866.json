 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project introduces improved organic laboratory experiments, new analytical laboratory projects, and enhanced undergraduate research experiences through the use of hyphenated gas chromatography/Fourier-transform infrared (GC/FTIR) spectrometry. Traditional macro- and micro-scale lab projects in organic chemistry can benefit from shorter analysis times, reduced chemical waste, and higher sensitivity when GC/FTIR replaces the traditional, sequential application of these techniques. New lab projects are being developed for analytical chemistry laboratories which examine both fundamental and applied aspects of this important hyphenated technique. Finally, ongoing and planned research projects involving undergraduate students also benefit from the use of GC/FTIR.   The implementation of this project can yield a meaningful enhancement of the laboratory experiences for students. Beyond the practical benefits of time efficiency and waste minimization, the use of such a modern, computer-controlled analytical system provides valuable training to undergraduates, better qualifying them for entry into the chemical workforce or advanced study programs.",
