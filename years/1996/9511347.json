 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511347  Kremer    There have been many retrospective statistical studies of the  effect of educational inputs on school performance.  However,  these retrospective studies will be biased if schools with  different educational inputs systematically differ in other,  unmeasured ways which are correlated with school performance.   For example, schools with better physical facilities may also  typically have parents who are more advantaged or more committed   to education, and this parental input, rather than the physical  facilities themselves, may be responsible for the correlation  between test scores and physical facilities.  This project  conducts a randomized trial which can overcome many of the  statistical problems of past studies.    The project carries out one of the first randomized trials on  educational inputs and school performance.  The trial is based on  the work of International Christian Humanitarian Services, (ITS),  a Kenyan GO.  ITS provides selected rural primary schools with  textbooks, exercise books, uniforms, classroom construction,  desks, and medical services.  The investigator will randomly  assign a group of candidate schools to either a control group or   treatment group.  Schools in the treatment group will receive  both educational and medical services from ITS.  Schools in the  control group will receive medical services in return for  participating in the program and cooperating with their  monitoring and evaluation efforts.  The project compares the  change in text scores and dropout rates between the two groups.    Since different components of the assistance package will be  provided in different years, and will affect different classes of  students, the investigator should be able to separately assess  the impact of the different inputs.  The project also examines  whether the impact of the additional resources differs with  students  gender or socio-economic status, or with teachers   training and pedagogic techniques.",
