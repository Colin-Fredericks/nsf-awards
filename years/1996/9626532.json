 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS 96-26532  Ren     The objective of this research is to investigate a new resampling   method, called the Leveraged Bootstrap. The Leveraged Bootstrap facilitates   research in a broad class of nonparametric and semiparametric    statistics using various types of censored data, including right censored   data, doubly censored data, interval censored data, etc.. This method does   not depend on the extensions of the usual statistics for complete data to   incomplete data, and is simple, computationally efficient and easily    applicable to a wide of variety of statistical inference problems with    different types of censored data. In this research, the following issues   are considered: (i) how the leveraged bootstrap should be applied in   practice; (ii) the efficiency of the leveraged bootstrap; (iii) comparison   with other methods. Specifically, the investigator studies the application   of the leveraged bootstrap in some statistical inference problems such as the   empirical likelihood methods in constructing confidence bands and tests,    and the hypothesis testing problems which are associated with several   statistical models.   %%%   Various types of censored data are generally referred to as   incomplete data in statistics literature. For instance, a patient who has   died from heart disease cannot go on to die from lung cancer. In such a   case, the survival time of lung cancer of the patient is incomplete.   Recently, doubly censored data and interval censored data have been   encountered in some very important clinical trials such as breast cancer   research and AIDS research. The statistical research on these types of   censored data still generally lags behind that on right censored data.   The principle difficulties in statistical analysis using these complicated    types of censored data are that the usual methods developed for complete   data often do not have direct extensions to incomplete data, and that the   usual nonparametric bootstrap can be quite computationally time  consuming   in certain cases. This research is to develop some new statistical methods   which are accurate, computationally efficient and easily applicable for   different types of censored data.  ***",
