 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accurate 3D reconstruction of biological tissue is technologically  challenging. The proposed project will fund acquisition of an  instrument to accommodate high-resolution reconstruction of large  tissue samples and would support histology of very hard bone samples.  The system is based on a Leica Cryopolycut, a large horizontal  cryostat. Modification of the basic system will permit imaging the  tissue block face at unprecedented resolution. Using already available  techniques, these block face images would guide accurate registration  of consecutive tissue sections.     The proposed instrument will be housed in the Computer Vision Center  for Vertebrate Brain Mapping (CVCVBM), a NIH Biomedical Technology  Resource. Three neuroimaging projects of the Center would directly  benefit from this grant. A fourth project to be supported by the  proposed instrument is in the field of mechanical and material  engineering.     The central objective of the CVCVBM is to develop the technology to  support multimodal fusion of brain histological data. The specific  focus is on the rat and mouse nervous system. The approach being  developed involves computer algorithms to map experimental data into  high-resolution, 20 m/voxel, 3D atlases. The proposed instrument would  support both construction of the rat and mouse atlas and critical tests  of the mapping algorithms.     The fourth project discussed in this proposal examines bone  remodeling activity in the vicinity of a new class of swelling type  composite materials for orthopaedic implant application. Here, the  critical feature offered by the Cryopolycut is its ability to section  through untreated bone.     The impact of the proposed infrastructure enhancement extends beyond  these projects. The CVCVBM research program is an instrumentation  development research program. Tools built at the Center are widely  distributed to other laboratories. Success in construction of the  multimodal fusion engine would likely enhance neurobiological research  at l arge. Furthermore, the facilities at the center are open to the  research community and the proposed instrumentation would compliment  currently available shared equipment to support construction of other  high resolution 3D digital atlases.",
