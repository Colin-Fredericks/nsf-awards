 "awd_abstract_narration": "9529949  Kochar    While poverty is generally associated with low rates of saving, a  striking feature of a number of developing countries is the  coexistence of extreme poverty with high savings rates.  In the  South Asian economies, for example, poverty coexists with  household savings rates which average 16% of disposable income.   In such economies income growth appears to be constrained not so  much by the rate of savings but by the apparent willingness of  households to hold their savings in relatively low yielding  forms.  Understanding why this is so is critical for designing  policy which enhances the productivity of savings, and,  correspondingly, increases income.  Surprisingly, there is little  empirical research on this topic, despite its obvious importance.   This research planning grant will permit the investigator to  develop an empirical research program on the relative importance  of expected marriage payments and the variability in earnings as  motives for household savings in south Asian economies.    This research carries important policy implications.  The belief  that income uncertainty and credit constraints motivate household  savings and contribute to the poverty of households has resulted  in an influential literature which advocates interventions in  credit and insurance markets.  In contrast, if households save  for consumption expenses and if it is this which diverts assets  from income-enhancing investments, the more effective policy  would target investments in areas such as women's education and  employment which may have the effect of reducing dowry payments.",
