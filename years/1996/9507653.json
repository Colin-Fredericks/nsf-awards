 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507653  Ritchie    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Robert O. Ritchie, Department of  Materials Science and Mineral Engineering, University of California,  Berkeley, to pursue with Dr. Do Kyung Kim, Department of Ceramic Science  and Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology  (KAIST), for 24 months, a program of cooperative research on microstructural  development and characterization of cyclic fatigue crack behavior of in situ  toughened monolithic silicon carbide (SiC) ceramics.  The joint research will  focus on the microstructural development of SiC ceramics sintered with oxide  additives in order to promote optimal mechanical properties, especially, fatigue  crack-growth behavior at elevated temperatures.  The Korean collaborator will  work primarily on the processing of recently developed in situ toughened SiC  (including microstructural control), characterization of the microstructure, and  determination of the role of additives on sintering behavior and mechanical  properties, including toughness and flexural strength.  SiC materials prepared  at KAIST will be sent to the PI's laboratory where cyclic fatigue behavior will  be characterized.  Fatigue-crack propagation behavior will be evaluated over  temperatures ranging from ambient to 1,800 C.  This phase of the work will  involve both macroscopic growth-rate measurements and characterization of  microstructural damage mechanisms.    Monolithic SiC-based ceramics are promising candidate materials for ultra-high  temperature structural components in heat engines, heat exchangers, and many  other devices because of their excellent oxidation resistance, strength retention  at high temperatures, high wear resistance, good thermal conductivity, and  relatively low coefficient of thermal expansion.  Considerable expertise has  been developed at KAIST in the production of these monolithic ceramics with  improved microstructures.  The PI's research group has developed  considerable expertise in the characteriza tion of such ceramics at ambient and  elevated temperatures.  The PI and his Korean collaborator are highly  respected researchers in the field of this proposal.  This project is relevant to  the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to  increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and  engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and  techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  This  project is related to the PI's research supported under  NSF Grant No. DMR-  9123279 and provides an international research experience for a U.S. graduate  student.  ***",
