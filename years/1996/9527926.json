Support for International Travel to Workshop on Loop  Parallelization    The International Workshop on Loop Parallelization, being held in  April 1966 in Wadern, Germany, has as its purpose bringing  together two research communities which are both working on Loop  Parallelization, but applying differing models and criteria.  One  of these communities has concentrated on parallelizing compilers  for sequential loops, pragmatically developing heuristic methods  that may work at high speed for a variety of loops, but are not  provably optimal, while the other community works on regular  array design, identifying optimal parallelizations for highly  regular loop nests.  The purpose of the Workshop is to get the  groups working together on a variety of common problems.  Researchers from the USA, Europe, and Japan are going to be  present.  This grant will guarantee a strong representation of  American scientists from the two relevant communities working on  this important aspect of parallel computation.",
