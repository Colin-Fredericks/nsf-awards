 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Shubin    The research will be concerned with problems from mathematical physics.  Several of the proposed problems center around the spectral theory of   random Schrodinger operators on trees or graphs or in the continuum.   A problem from the study of integral equations which has applications   to models from physics is also discussed.     Some of the problems to be investigated arise from the field of   solid state physics. To form a rough idea, start by imagining the motion   of a particle such as an electron in a crystal with a perfectly regular   structure. It is well-known that an electron, with a certain energy (in a   band), will travel through the crystal. In other words, the crystal acts as   a conductor. Consider a crystal with impurities. Such a system is called   disordered. Will this disordered crystal also act as a conductor? In   order to begin to answer this question, a precise definition of disorder   needs to be given. However many types of disordered crystals are not   conductors; rather they are insulators. Since the seminal work of Nobel   Prize winner P. Anderson, disordered systems have been the object of   intense mathematical investigations. Although many questions have been   answered in the past forty years, many more problems remain open.  In particular, disordered systems with space dimension greater than one,   are not well understood.",
