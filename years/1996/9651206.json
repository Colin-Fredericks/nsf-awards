 "awd_abstract_narration": "The equipment requested is for two psychology and computer science cluster courses:  \"Neural and Machine Intelligence\" and \"Social Networks on an Electronic Network.\" Both cluster course pairs are addressed to the general sophomore/junior level student and must meet the needs of majors and non-majors alike.  Students enroll in both courses simultaneously.  Lectures are   coordinated or team taught, while labs are completely integrated.  Ideally, approximately 24 students (8 computer science, 8 psychology, and 8 other majors) enroll in each course, each semester.  In the laboratory components students combine psychology and computer science knowledge and skills to conduct experiments in neural, social and electronic networks.  The proposed UNIX server supports the preemptive multi-tasking operating system that is essential to support both clusters.  Integrating psychology and computer science in these courses promises to actively involve students with the course content and enable them to apply that content through meaningful laboratory experiments and simulation.
