 "awd_abstract_narration": "Water bound to proteins is a ubiquitous and integral component of  the  protein  surface,  as observed by X-ray  crystallography.  A  substantial  proportion of surface-bound water  is  required  for  protein  activity, and remains even under unfavorable  conditions  such  as  repeated rinsing in organic solvent. Bound  water  also  plays essential and diverse roles in protein-ligand interactions;  for  instance, water is required for the recognition of  operator  DNA  by  trp  repressor, and is essential not only for  inhibitor  binding by trypsin, but also for trypsin catalysis.    This  proposal addresses several outstanding questions concerning  protein-water and proteinwater-ligand interactions. What  is  the  chemistry,   beyond   hydrogen  bonding,  that   determines   the  favorability  of  water  binding  sites  and  their  conservation  between  structures? How can this knowledge be to used to  assess  the   favorability  of  sites  and  to  predict   hydration?   In  particular,  given  the uncomplexed structure  of  a  protein  or  ligand,  can  the bound water sites mediating the  protein-ligand  interaction  be predicted? Using the same techniques designed  to  answer  these  questions, advanced software  for  modeling  bound  water will be developed and distributed. Key applications of this  software  will  be  to  fill two major gaps  in  current  solvent  modeling,  by  providing a knowledge-based, uniform  approach  to  water  site  assignment for crystallography, and  by  identifying  active-site  hydration appropriate to include in  computer-guided  ligand design and docking.",
