 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will contribute to our understanding of two  economic phenomena, neither of which has been satisfactorily  explained to date.  The first is why the prices of primary  commodities such as rice, tin, copper, etc. have trended slowly  downward over time, in spite of vast increases in demand.  For  many of these goods, it is thought that supply disturbances are  the most important determinants of price; the coffee harvest  fails in Brazil, or there is a miners' strike in Zaire or Chile.  If so, it is hard to explain why it is that booms and slumps in  prices last so long, instead of coming and going with the  fluctuations in weather or political events that cause them.  Another widely canvassed explanation looks to the behavior of  speculators whichy can prolong slumps and booms.  However,  previous research has shown that speculative activity, even in  conjunction with supply shocks, cannot explain what is observed.   This project will focus on wage trends in developing countries as  a possible explanation for falling commodity prices and  industrial demand as an explanation for shorter-term  fluctuations.  If these explanations are correct, it will switch  attention away from speculators and storage as the main source of  commodity price fluctuations.    The second topic analyzes saving and wealth accumulation, with a  particular focus on explaining disparities between people in  their living standards and wealth.  Many industrialized economies  have experienced sharp increases in inequality during the 1980s.   There are many potential explanations for this increase including  technological shifts, demographic changes, and increasing  competition from developing countries, but the dynamics of  inequality remain mysterious.  Recent research has drawn a link  between asset accumulation, time, and inequality.  Because  different people are differentially lucky in their earnings and  income, and because differences in luck cumulate over time,  inequality in living standards is likely t o increase with time  for any given group of people.  This appears to be true for the  United States, with much greater earning and consumption  inequality among older than younger Americans.  This research  will look at whether this is also true for wealth, and whether,  as the theory suggests, wealth inequality increases particularly  rapidly over time.  More generally, the links between earnings  inequality and wealth inequality and the role played by saving  will be analyzed.",
