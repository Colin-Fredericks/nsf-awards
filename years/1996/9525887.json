 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project studies techniques for performing efficient  communication in parallel computers that have faulty components.   Parallel computers with a large number of identical processors have  a great potential for fault-tolerance.  The main challenge that  must be overcome in order to exploit this potential for fault-  tolerance is the fact that faults also affect communications  between processors.  Hardware faults in processors, routers, and  communication links force messages to take new paths that avoid the  faulty components.  In addition, the mapping of computations from  faulty processors to nonfaulty ones changes the pattern of  communication.  As a result, faults can have a major impact on the  performance, and even correctness, of the communication subsystem  in a parallel computer.  Specifically, the project focuses on the  following two key issues; creating efficient, deadlock-free routing  algorithms for parallel computers with faulty components, and  developing efficient mappings of communication-intensive real-time  applications to parallel computers that contain faults.  This  research will result in more efficient use of parallel computers  and a better understanding of how their inherent potential for  fault-tolerance can be utilized.",
