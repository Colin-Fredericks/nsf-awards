 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this project is to determine the time  complexity of solving various numerical computation problems on  parallel distributed-memory machines in general by abstracting  the common properties of these problems via dependency graphs. To  that effect, two important topics are considered: (1) the design  and analysis of parallel numerical algorithms and (2) the  derivation of lower bounds on complexity. Working within LogP, a  recently-introduced model for parallel computation, parallel  complexity will be analyzed by taking into account three  important factors: (i) initial data placement, (ii) communication  scheduling, and (iii) local operations. Algorithms which are  efficient on LogP are portable from one parallel machine to  another and will be efficient on any parallel machine. Initially  several different numerical computation problems will be  considered and the parallel complexity for each specific problem  will be determined. The overall results will be used to help  extract the important criteria of dependency graphs and thereby  classify numerical computation problems via these criteria.  Furthermore, the parallel complexity for each classification of  numerical computation problems will be determined. The importance  of the results obtained lies in the ability to pinpoint what  types of data placements and communication schedulings are needed  in order to achieve efficient or optimal running times for large  classes of numerical problems.    Clearly, this research potentially impacts a wide variety of  applications and computational problems from various domains  which are currently difficult to address. In order to  successfully accomplish this research and apply it to these  domains, there must be education and training of people in the  parallel and numerical computing field. To that effect, a program  in parallel and numerical computing will be developed beginning  with course preparation at the undergraduate level and  culminating in a research program at  the doctoral level.  ***",
