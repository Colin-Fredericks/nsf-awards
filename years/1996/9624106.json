 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to advance the state-of-the-art of  distributed  multimedia systems in both research and education. A novel  approach for managing heterogeneous resources in a shared distributed  multimedia network is presented, called multiclass relative Quality-of  Service.   The research agenda concentrates on the exploration od this  approach, the design and evaluation of traffic control algorithms, and  their implementation and  empirical evaluation in a testbed network.  The  education agenda is focused on the use of multimedia technology  to  innovate  education.  The research and education agenda will:    1) develop new approaches for resource management in distributed  multimedia  systems that can operate in a shared network environment. A new  service  model,  called  multi-class  relative Quality-of-Service, is  proposed. Different from existing service models for multimedia networks,  the proposed service model can satisfy service requirements of most  delay-sensitive multimedia applications, yet can be realized in the  current infrastructure of shared network resources.    2) design and analyze novel traffic control algorithms for resource  management in multimedia networks with multi-class relative Quality  of-Service. The proposed research includes development and  evaluation  of  flow control methods for relative Quality-of-Service, approaches to cope  with dynamically changing resource management policies, and new routing  algorithms.    3) design, implement, and experimentally evaluate new protocol  mechanisms  for resource management in distributed multimedia systems. By implementing  the mechanisms as extensions to currently used network protocols, existing  networks can gradually evolve  to  an  environment  with  Quality-of-Service guarantees.    4) gain insight in and evaluate the use of interactive  multimedia  for  education.  An interactive tele-tutoring tool, already partially realized  by the PI, that enables  teachers and students to interact over  a campus  network, will provide an experimental platform to study  the  use  of  interactive multimedia tools for teaching.    5) contribute to the establishment of `multimedia' as a main area of an  education in computer science. This includes the development of a  project-oriented senior level course in multimedia systems that uses  multimedia classrooms available at the institution.",
