 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wei Kong of Oregon State University has been awarded a CAREER grant in   the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to investigate ways of   orienting chemical reactants to achieve reaction selectivity.  The goal   is the ability to selectively cleave a designated chemical bond with   minimum effects from competitive pathways.  Using supersonic molecular   beams and moderate electric fields, orientation of polar reactants has   been observed.  The oriented chemical bond will then be selectively   dissociated by a linearly polarized laser.  Depending on the direction of   the transition dipole moment of the oriented molecules and the   polarization direction of the laser, one reaction coordinate will be   preferentially excited, resulting in selective cleavage of a chemical   bond.  Prof. Kong's educational plans include development of a new course   on chemical reaction dynamics emphasizing a `case studies` approach, and   the teaching of an existing quantum chemistry course from a historical   perspective.    Selectivity in a multiple-path reaction is one of the most fascinating   questions in chemical kinetics and reaction dynamics, and achieving   selectivity has been a major driving force in many scientific endeavors.    With selectivity, different reaction pathways can be isolated and   investigated in detail.  This ability will not only allow a deeper   understanding of each reaction path, but also enable investigations of   systems that would otherwise be too complicated to tackle.",
