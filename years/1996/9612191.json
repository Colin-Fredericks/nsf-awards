 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612191  Erim  The objective of this study is to investigate the usefulness  of two state-of-the-art methods in the analysis of  electrical signals recorded from human muscles.  These  techniques are wavelet and time-frequency transforms, which  have yielded favorable results in data compression,  nonstationary signal analysis and noise removal; and fuzzy  logic which has been successfully employed in decision-  making and control fields. These methods will be applied to  two main problems encountered in the analysis of signals  recorded from muscles:  a) the identification of the  activities of individual muscle units represented in signals  recorded via needle electrodes, and b) the analysis of the  time-varying nature of signals recorded during dynamic  contractions via surface electrodes attached to the skin  over the muscle.  The availability of powerful analysis  tools will enhance the research in these fields geared  toward gaining a better understanding of the control of  muscles by the central nervous system, as well as the  development of reliable diagnostic procedures to be used in  the clinical environment.  The initial year will be devoted  to the implementation of the techniques proposed to be  employed in the study, and to the application of these to  specific signals recorded from muscles.  It is hoped that  this year will serve to provide the principal investigator  with expertise in these new fields and help to establish her  as an independent researcher.  It is further hoped that the  work carried out during this year will produce the  preliminary results necessary to demonstrate the  applicability of the mentioned techniques to the  investigation of muscle signals, and that it will lead to  the proposal of at least one full-blown study structured  according to the findings and conclusions of the present  study.        ***",
