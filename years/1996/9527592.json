Despite this selection, the genes are variable within populations, which makes this an interesting system to study how genetic variation is maintained.  This project will quantify how genetic variation affects gamete competition in the fruitfly Drosophila.  This model organism allows examination of general questions that would be much harder to study in larger organisms.  Several aspects of gamete competition will be studied, including genetic variation among females in the tendency to use gametes from different males, and the opportunity for male by female interactions in the magnitude of gamete competition.  The genes that encode the male accessory gland proteins (Acps) have been identified as likely components of gamete competition.  Joint analysis of molecular sequence variation within species and variation in gamete competition will allow inferences of causal connections between Acp genes and gamete competition.  Experiments will pursue components of displacement from both directions:  from phenotypic variation in sperm displacement toward identifying the molecular basis for the difference, and from identifying molecular variants toward testing their effects on gamete competition.  Results of recent and proposed experiments raise several crucial theoretical questions about the maintenance of variation in genes that affect gamete competition.  Results from the theoretical work will suggest explanations for the maintenance of variation and the rapid evolution of Acp genes.",
