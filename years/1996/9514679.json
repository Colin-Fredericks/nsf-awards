This problem remains  unsolved, in human vision as in computer vision, because the  intensity of light reflected from any given surface in the visual  world, regardless of its actual shade of gray, can vary by a  factor of a billion to one, depending on lighting conditions.   Prior research has established that the perceived shade of gray  of a surface depends on the intensity of that surface relative to  that of neighboring surfaces, not its absolute intensity, and  that relative intensity is just what is encoded when light from  the world strikes the human retina.  But this brings into focus  what has been called the anchoring problem:  How is an absolute  or specific shade of gray assigned to these relative intensity  values?   The general approach of the work will be to formulate   alternative potential rules the visual system might use and then  to construct visual displays that produce retinal images capable  of testing among these rules.  For a given display, one rule  might predict that a particular surface will be seen as middle  gray while a competing rule might predict that the same surface  will be seen as white.  The display will be presented to a set of  naive human observers, from whom reports will be obtained as to  the apparent gray shade of the surface.  They will indicate the  appearance of the target surface by choosing a matching chip from  a standard scale of gray chips under standard lighting  conditions.  The work of this project will build upon a series of  findings from previous funding that have established the rules of  anchoring for relatively simple visual displays.  In short these  rules state that, for simple images, the surface with the highest  intensity will be seen as white and darker regions will be scaled  relative to this standard.  But relative size of regions has also   been shown to be important and can override the role of the  highest intensity in certain cases.  Prior work along these lines  has produced a model of visual functioning that has already  proven to account for much of the research literature in this  field.  The work of this research project will be guided by  contradictions and gaps in this model.  An important goal will be  the extension of the model to ever more complex images.  The  solution of this problem in human vision should make it easier to  solve the problem for computer vision.    ***",
