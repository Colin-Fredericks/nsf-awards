 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514225  Jorns  The area of flavins and flavoproteins is a broad, but clearly and simply defined one.  It covers all aspects of work pertaining to the chemistry  and biology of compounds based on the isoalloxazine nucleus and on  very closely related structures.  Because of the extraordinary versatility  of flavin as a prosthetic group and its  involvement in a variety of important  biological oxidation  and reduction processes, this area continues to expand rapidly.  Interest in flavins ranges from theoretical chemistry to medical aspects.  The 12th International Symposium on flavins and Flavoproteins is to be held at the University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada, June 30-July 6, 1996, as one of a series which has been organized at 3-year intervals since 1965,  The last symposium was held  in Nagoya, Japan in 1993.  Because of the continued and increasing pace of research in this area, it is important that regularly scheduled meetings be held.  Review lectures will cover the entire field and the meeting should bring together scientists from all over the world from a wide variety of disciplines, and promote valuable discussion and exchange of information.  In addition, it should serve the purposes of keeping existing workers fully up to date with all aspects of the subject and of initiating young investigators into this important area of research.",
