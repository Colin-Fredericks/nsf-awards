 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brooks Pate of the University of Virginia has been awarded a CAREER grant   in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to initiate studies of   laser control of molecular conformations for practical laser chemistry.    The goal of these investigations is to selectively populate a single   molecular conformational structure, resulting in an enhanced reaction   rate along the desired pathway.  In the two-laser experiment, molecules   are first excited to an energy region where the vibrational states   localized around the different conformational minima are coupled through   intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR).  Since the   vibrational frequencies depend on conformation, a second (resonant) laser   is then selected to stimulate emission to a lower state.  This lower   energy state lies below the onset energy for IVR, hence the final   structure is localized around the one desired conformation.   Little is   known about the conformations that a vibrationally excited molecule can   assume, yet reaction rates are strongly dependent on the conformational   structure.  These techniques will provide the first information of this   type and hence may lead to truly ground-breaking results.    The educational component of Prof. Pate's CAREER award will emphasize the   development of a physical chemistry course along the lines of a `research   training` course for those students interested in physical chemistry   careers, better utilization of computers in the curriculum, e.g.,   symbolic math software for problem manipulations, and incorporation of   modern research instrumentation in the laboratory courses.",
