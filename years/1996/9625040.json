 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625040  Nordin  There is a growing need for high capacity, rapid access data storage  systems for applications such as video-on-demand, multimedia, large scale  databases, and storage of huge sensor-derived data sets. As has been widely  recognized, volume holographic storage concepts offer the potential of  achieving such large data storage capacities in an extremely dense format  with rapid data access times. However, holographic materials issues  continue to pose challenges for the practical realization volume  holographic data storage systems. A key aspect of this situation is the  lack of suitable thick (-1 cm) permanent holographic media for read only  and write-once-read-many (WORM) systems. Such media are a critical  requirement for many potential applications in which dynamic storage is not  needed.    The primary goal of the research plan in this proposal is to solve this  problem by developing a method whereby currently available thin-film  holographic media with otherwise attractive properties can be used in  applications such as volume holographic data storage that require thick  holographic media. Specifically, stratified volume holographic optical  elements (SVHOE's) composed of thin holographic layers interleaved with  optically homogeneous buffer layers to form thick (~1 cm) structures will  be developed to emulate the properties of conventional bulk holographic  media. Previous studies of SVHOE's indicate the presence of a periodic  angular sensitivity, which is unsuitable for volume holographic data  storage in which the Bragg effect is used to minimize crosstalk between  superimposed pages of recorded information. We will investigate removing  this periodic angular sensitivity by modifying the SVHOE structure in two  ways; first, with random buffer layer thicknesses and, second, with thicker  holographic layers that themselves operate in the Bragg diffraction regime.  Critical issues to be addressed include: (1) generalization of SVHOE  diffraction models and analysis to the  case of highly multiplexed gratings,  (2) development of models of SVHOE diffraction behavior for random buffer  thicknesses and thick holographic layers, (3) experimental verification of  the predictions of such models, (4) determination of the fundamental and  practical limits of SVHOE data storage capacity, and (5) determination of  optical crosstalk and bit error rate performance both theoretically and  experimentally. The outcome of the proposed work will be a thorough  exploration of SVHOE diffraction properties and how such structures can be  configured and used for holographic data storage systems.    The education plan proposed herein is composed of three elements. The first  is a new interdisciplinary graduate course for both computer engineering  and optics students on the use of optics and photonics in electronic  digital parallel computing. It will be taught by a computer engineer and an  optical scientist, and will include both optics and parallel computing  topics. The intent is to provide optics and computer engineering students  with a broad enough background that they can investigate in a highly  practical manner the potential of enhancing electronic digital computers  through the employment of optical devices and subsystems. The second  element of the education plan is the development of a one credit hour  enrichment laboratory for undergraduate students on 3-D displays. During a  six-week summer term, students will be exposed to a wide range of 3-D  display topics, from basic concepts to state-of-the-art research and  development work. They will personally explore the effects of various 3-D  visual cues with special hardware available at UAH, and they will make  their own holograms. The third element is a K-12 outreach program targeted  at high school and elementary school students. High school students will be  involved in a one day hands-on holographic display seminar as part of UAH's  Introduction of Minorities to Engineering and Technology program. In  addition, a series  of science and engineering topics will be developed for  a half-day elementary school presentation that will include many  demonstrations and examples and one or two short projects. The aim of the  presentation will be to encourage inquisitiveness and curiosity about  physical phenomena, and to provide a sense of the purpose of science and  engineering activity. All of these educational activities will involve the  use of optics for practical applications, which is also the basic thrust of  the research project.  ***",
