 "awd_abstract_narration": "9513881  FRIEDMAN    This research is concerned with early development of temporal  knowledge in normal human infants.  The findings will tell us how  children come to adapt to an important feature of their  environment, its temporal regularities.  The results will  complement recent discoveries about infants' knowledge of other  fundamental domains, such as space, gravity, the continued  existence of objects when they are hidden, and causality.  As  part of a broader program of research on the developmental  psychology of time, this work can help us better understand the  growth of temporal knowledge in children.  Along with research on  the psychology of time in adults, this research will help us  understand how humans abstract a sense of time from the flow of  experience.  Knowledge of how children adapt to the temporal  features of their world will be useful to practitioners who  design preschool curricula and early childhood intervention  programs.  It will also provide comparative information about  normal development that can be used by clinicians who work with  children with disabilities.      The focus of this research is on humans' sensitivity to temporal  order in simple event sequences.  Adults are highly attuned to  forward vs. backward presentations of transformations that can  only happen in one temporal direction: A film of liquid pouring,  when viewed in reverse, is strikingly anomalous.  Adults must  have internalized, temporally-organized representations of how  thousands of such transformations normally unfold.  However, very  little is known about the origins and nature of this sensitivity.   Preliminary work has suggested that expectations about the  temporal direction of several transformations, such as pouring a  liquid or breaking an object, develop between 4 and 12 months of  age.  These experiments will add to these findings in a number of  ways.  All of the studies involve comparisons of infants' visual  attention to videotapes of temporally normal and reversed or  mi s-ordered events.  A first experiment is designed to illuminate  the role that learning plays in the development of temporal  expectations by teaching infants specific, novel transformations.   Two other studies will test the limits of competence in  4-month-olds, a group which has failed to show directional  preferences in some studies.  A fourth study will sample new  transformations in order to shed light on the breadth of  8-month-olds' knowledge and on the specific features of the films  that are responsible for their looking preferences.  A final  experiment will test whether 1-year-old infants have developed  expectations of the temporal order of familiar event sequences  made up of discrete actions. This evidence can reveal whether  infants in the first year of life have developed representations  of lengthier time patterns than have been tested to date.    ***",
