 "awd_abstract_narration": "9530592  Ergas  Biofiltration is a low cost and effective method for controlling  emissions of biodegradable volatile organic compounds (VOC's)  from chemical and process industries.  Studies and field  applications of these systems, however, have been limited to  inlet VOC concentrations of less than 1,000 ppmv.  At high inlet  concentrations, microbial growth results in plugging of biofilter  media pore spaces.  In addition, these systems are of limited use  where degradation results in the formation of acidic metabolites  or where cosubstrates must be added to induce enzymes required  for cometabolism.    To overcome the limitations described above, biological treatment  systems for VOC control must be developed which: 1) incorporate  mass transfer of VOCs across a media with high specific surface  area and low diffusion length, 2) incorporate high biomass  concentrations to maintain high biodegradation rates, 3) provide  a method for wasting biomass to prevent clogging, and 4) provide  a method for addition of pH buffers, nutrients, and/or co-  substrates to support the microbial population and neutralize  acidic metabolites.  A specially designed bioreactor is under  investigation which has the potential to meet these requirements  and achieve high VOC removal efficiencies in small reactor  volumes.  The reactor utilizes hydrophobic microporous hollow  fiber membranes for mass transfer.  Gases containing VOCs are  passed through bundles of hollow fiber membranes.  Soluble  compounds in the gas phase are transferred through the membranes  to the surrounding liquid nutrient media.  Compounds in the  liquid phase are then available for biodegradation.    The proposed project will further investigate the use of  microporous hydrophobic hollow fiber membrane systems for  biological treatment of gas phase VOCS.  Specific objectives  include: investigation of factors controlling mass transfer and  biodegradation; investigation of conditions for use in  cometabolism of the model chlorinated VOC, tr ichloroethene;  refinement and testing of mathematical models of mass transfer  and biodegradation.",
