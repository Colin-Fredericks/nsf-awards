 "awd_abstract_narration": "9624189  Wilkening    Unequivocally endorsed by the Chancellors and the UC Regents, CAMP  has become the standard bearer for ensuring diversity among our  student populations systemwide.  CAMP has come far in the first  four years, laying the groundwork for exiting new possibilities  that extend the program in various ways to further develop the  pipeline to baccalaureate degrees and beyond.  NSF funding phase II  will allow extending the project by strengthening the quality and  quantity of B.S. degree recipients among underrepresented students;  expanding curricular reforms; integrating and institutionalizing  programmatic components; linking with teacher preparation through  K-12 collaboration; continuing to disseminate successful efforts,  and extending the use of evaluation to decision-making.  Phase II  offers a set of experiences that engage the entire educational  continuum and also extend to the development of minority teachers  in science, mathematics, engineering and technology fields.   Through summer and academic year programs that have seen  unprecedented success, and through new bold plans that address the  transition to graduate and professional school, Phase II promises  to advance the faculty-driven momentum that the Alliance has  achieved.  New collaborations and synergy with related initiatives  will fuel our endeavors.  Similarly, linkages with business and  industry will be strengthened through the Statewide advancement  officer who will be dedicated to developing corporate partnerships  at each UC campus.",
