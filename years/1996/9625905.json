 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625905  Chan    This award provides support for development of a novel  method of eddy cement spectroscopy.  The sheet resistance of  a film is the product of the sheet carrier density and the  carrier mobility , each of physical and technological  interest.  The standard eddy current measurement can  determine the sheet resistance of a conducting film without  contacting it, but this measurement does not give  information about the carrier density or carrier mobility  separately.  Buy taking this technique to a regime of  microscopic sampling area, the sheet resistance will  fluctuate because of carrier Brownian motion in and out of  the sampling area.  The carrier density and the carrier  mobility can be separately determined by analyzing the  amplitude and the time dependence of these fluctuations.  A  magnetic field is not needed for the measurement, so  carriers confined to quantum wires can still be measured.  The eddy current spectroscopy (ECS) technique requires a  microfabricated coil to be placed near the sample.  A method  where the coil and sample together act as an amplitude  modulator that impresses the resistance fluctuations onto a  radio frequency carrier is described.  The amplitude  modulated radio frequency signal can then be analyzed by a  spectrum analyzer.  %%%  The ECS technique has many features that can significantly  advance electrical characterization of electronic materials  in either a research or a manufacturing environment.  These  features include:  It is a noncontact and a nondestructive  technique, so sample preparations is unnecessary;   it only  requires that a coil be near the sample, leaving room for  other probes, electrical properties then can be spatially  correlated with other properties of the sample;  it  intrinsically measures a small area, so high resolution  mobility and carrier density maps can be obtained;  it is  sensitive to the microstructure of the sample, and can help  elucidate microstructures; and it does not require any bulky  component,  such as a large magnet, and can potentially be  desktop size.    ***",
