 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project jointly funded by the Division of International Programs   and the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division, Professor Charles Wight of the University of Utah will   collaborate with E. Y. Misochko of the Institute of Chemical Physics in   Chernogolovka, Russia.   In this program Fourier Transform infrared   (FTIR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies will be   used to study photochemical reactions of F and H atoms with simple   molecules in low-temperature matrices.  The expertise of the   investigators is complementary, with Wight responsible for the FTIR   experiments and Misochko for the EPR.  Through this collaboration these   researchers will be able to formulate a comprehensive description of hot   atom mobility, diffusion of thermalized atoms, and atom-molecule   reactions that occur in the restrictive environment of low-temperature   solids.  Thin layers of solid `noble gas` matrices at very low-temperatures are an   ideal vehicle for containing highly reactive or transient chemical   species so that they can be studied using a technique called matrix   isolation spectroscopy.  Using this technique the mechanisms by which a   number of chemical transformations occur can be unravelled and examined.    Examples of such reactions are polymerization, explosive decomposition,   and combustion.  Through this international collaboration, the   complementary resources of a Russian and an American investigator will be   combined to produce a more complete picture of these types of processes   than might be obtained by either scientist working alone.",
