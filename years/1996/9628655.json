 "awd_abstract_narration": "Momoh  Howard University  HRD 9628655    Howard University has been involved in power systems research for over a decade and is now among the  top five schools in the United States for power research, attracting minority students (both undergraduate  and graduate), faculty and postdoctoral research associates from across the country as well as from abroad.   Recent outreach programs involving high school and pre-college minority students have created a strong  awareness and interest in electrical engineering concepts.    The Enhancement of Minority Power Research in the Development of Advanced Tools for Emerging needs  of Power Systems is designed to meet the challenges of today's power industry with the objective of  delivering an economic reliable power supply and enhancing research education for minority students an  faculty.  The following tasks outlined in this proposal build upon our current strengths:       (a)       Develop a program to build research of current interest to the US economy.       (b)       Develop a program to attract, retain and expose minority students (high school, college,                                         graduate and postdoctoral fellows and faculty and visiting professors.       (c)       Develop and maintain a first-class research center with modem state-of-the-art equipment.       (d) Conduct an outreach program via seminars and other activities for high school and pre-college      students.    The research component of the proposal focuses on investigating two of the top national needs in power  systems as identified by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), Department of Energy (DOE) and  the National Science Foundation (NSF).  The two topics are in the area of generation and transmission   planning and distribution automation.  In the generation and transmission planning area, two major  priorities are identified- incorporating unit commitment and transmission constraints in the medium term  operations planning models or the production costing mod els, and combining unit commitment, optimal   power flow and power brokerage functions in an integrated environment for analysis of power scheduling  and trading.  A multi-objective optimization-based dynamic security-constrained rescheduling model is   proposed as a means to guard against potential instability against dynamic contingencies.  In the area of  distribution automation two key problems, automatic fault location and network reconfiguration. have been  selected.  The core research involves designing and implementing fault location algorithms using a hybrid  expert system/fuzzy logic approach.  The network reconfiguration modeling involves use of the interior-  point-based mixed-integer-programming optimization algorithms coupled with artificial neural network and  a rule-based system for performing switching operations, VAR control and load curtailment.     The Electrifcal Engineering department s educational curriculum ensures proper dissemination of our   finds through seminars, visiting scientists  program and short courses.    This proposal will help increase the representation of minority engineers in the field of power  engineering by increasing the number of minority students entering graduate and undergraduate  programs.  It will help develop the infrastructure, thereby providing graduate and undergraduate  students state-of-the-art equipment for conducting research.  It will assist minority research faculty and  staff in conducting and assisting minority students in high level research.  Finally, it will provide  solutions to top priority research needs of the power industry.",
