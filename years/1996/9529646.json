 "awd_abstract_narration": "9529646  Johnson    This is a renewal proposal based on the results and  accomplishments of an ongoing NSF-DMR project, which  demonstrated that microwave and RF plasma heating enhanced  densification of -alumina with a significant reduction in  sintering temperature.  The PI will extend the previous work  to a fundamental investigation of rapid sintering and  microstructure development of -alumina utilizing microwave  excited plasmas.    Preliminary results show that plasma sintering will  alleviate the problems of loss of volatile components in -  alumina without costly encapsulation.  Moreover, the plasma  sintering configuration is ideally suited for the rapid and  continuous sintering of tubes, which should improve product  uniformity.  The proposed research is focused on the  scientific issues that govern the sintering characteristics  of ceramics containing volatile components, such as sodium  and lithium in -alumina, which limit the technological  feasibility of -alumina as an electrolyte for sodium-based  battery applications.    The following objectives will be pursued:       1.  Investigate sintering of -alumina under microwave  excited plasma, with and without grain boundary dopant  additions.       2.  Quantify the microstructure development under  plasma sintering conditions using an arsenal of ion,  electron, and photon beam techniques.       3.  Elucidate the role of grain boundary dopants used  to manipulate the microstructure and alter the grain  boundary ionic conductivity.  %%%  The outcome of the proposed research will shed light on the  potential for plasma sintering of ceramics containing  volatile components in general, and -alumina in particular.  The ultimate objective of our undertaking is to dramatically  reduce the processing cost and increase the performance and  reliability of -alumina to a point that it is attractive for  commercial application in sodium-based batteries and other  applications of sodium ionic conductors.  ***",
