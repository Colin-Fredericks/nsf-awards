 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on developing algorithms for a variety of problems  in the theory and practice of scheduling and resource allocation.   The  project concentrates on: (i) developing improved approximation  algorithms for problems in combinatorial scheduling theory; (ii)  developing on-line algorithms for resource allocation; and (iii)  implementing and testing these algorithms.   In particular, the first  goal of the project is to develop general techniques for the design of  approximation algorithms for NP-hard scheduling problems.  These  techniques are based on several classes of integer programming  formulations, and they have already been applied to yield approximation  algorithms for average weighted completion time for a number of  constrained scheduling problems.   The second goal in this area is to  better understand, from the prospective of worst-case analysis, the  strengths of these general techniques.  The third goal is to investigate  approximation algorithms for multi-criteria scheduling problems.   The  fourth goal is to study on-line scheduling and resource allocation  questions, focusing initially on algorithms that provide good average  service to a stream of jobs, of different types and priorities, that  arrive over time.  The outcome of this study is expected to be:  (a) a better theoretical understanding of a number of models and  optimality criteria and (b) algorithms for a network of workstations and  modern parallel computers (such as the IBM SP2).***",
