 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630091   Anderson   In this project, laboratory studies related to stratospheric ozone will be carried out. The focus will  be on two tasks: (1) an isotopic study of ozone production from the reaction between vibrationally excited and thermal oxygen molecules, and (2) the development of an ultra-sensitive diagnostic for detecting the absorption of light by ozone near the dissociation threshold.    For task (1), an apparatus will be constructed where mixtures containing ozone and isotopically labeled oxygen will be photolyzed. The products will be analyzed using mass spectrometry. The production of ozone through this channel has been hypothesized but as yet not demonstrated. If it occurs, it could constitute a significant source of ozone not currently included in stratospheric models.   In task (2), the feasibility of a photo-initiated chemiluminescence/ionization (PICL/I) diagnostic for the detection of weak ozone absorption in the near infrared will be investigated. A slow-flow photo-reactor will be constructed to mix ozone with selected reagent gases in the presence of near-IR radiation. Absorption by ozone will most likely yield dissociation to produce oxygen atoms, which in turn react with a reagent species to yield chemiluminescence or chemiionization. Detection of those emitted photons or ions will be exploited as a sensitive detector for ozone absorption.   If successfully developed, this technique will be used in the future to investigate the role of these low lying ozone states in oxygen atom/molecule recombination and other potentially important atmospheric processes.   ***",
