 "awd_abstract_narration": "9628749  Shimizu    This grant provides $538,966 as partial support of costs of  salaries, equipment and supplies associated with the continued  operation of the North East Regional Ion Microprobe Facility  (NERIMF) at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution over the next  three years.  Previous support of this facility was solely for the  operation and maintenance of a Cameca ims 3f ion microprobe.   Support for the development of operational techniques on their  newly acquired,state-of-the-art, Cameca ims 1270 ion microprobe  (EAR-9214641) is included in this awards for facility support.  The  two-machine operation will be under the direct supervision of  Nobumichi Shimizu at Woods Hole but the ims 1270 was purchased  through contributions from a partnership of institutions including,  Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), the American Museum of  Natural History (AMNH), Brown University, Lamont-Doherty Earth  Observatory (LDEO), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)  and Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) so that early technique  development on the ims 1270 will include PI's from these  institutions as well as WHOI.  This award represents a modest  increase (ca 9%) over their current level of support for operation  and maintenance of the ims 3f, yet development of techniques  utilizing the ims 1270 will be the primary thrust of this group  over the next three years.  Specifically, outside user access to  the ims 1270 will be restricted for the first 27 months to allow  the partnership to pursue technique developments including, in situ  measurement of U/Pb ratios in zircons for geochronologic  investigations, measurement of isotopic ratios of elements in the  U-series disequilibria in Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalts as indicators of  the petrologic history of these magmas and high precision  measurements of the Sr/Ca ratio recorded in corals at very high  resolutions (sub-annual to possibly sub-weekly) as proxies of paleo  sea surface temperatures in paleoclimatologic studies.  A dditional  work will focus on the development of standards for both U/Pb  zircon geochronology and for trace elemental analyses.  Analyses of  trace element ratios in biogenic carbonates at micro-scale spatial  resolution will allow unprecedented determination of records of  global change.  While the ims 1270,due to its high mass resolution  and high transmission is uniquely suited to studies of U-series  isotopic ratios as well as high spatial resolution elemental  analyses of environmentally important trace elements (i.e. Cu, Zn,  Pb) in biogenic carbonates, the ims 3f will continue to provide for  the analytical determination of trace elemental abundances in  geological samples where the high sensitivity of the ims 1270 is  not critical.  ***",
