 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past ten years DNA sequencing has become one of the  major cornerstones of biological and biomedical research.  Although more than 40 research groups on the Princeton campus  must sequence DNA as part of their ongoing research programs, the  procedures currently used by these groups are inefficient, time  consuming, and increasingly antiquated. For this reason, the  Department of Molecular Biology is requesting funds for the  purchase of automated DNA sequencing instrumentation. This  instrumentation includes the following items:   ABI Prism Automated DNA Sequencer, Model 377-01, including  installation and on-site training, data collection software,  Macintosh power Mac, two (2) Gel Cassettes, top and bottom gel  pouring mixtures (1 set), and user manual   Sequencing software module, including sequencing analysis  software, Manual and Chemistry Guide, two (2) 36 Well Sharkstooth  combs, and the sequencing installation kit   Fast sequencing or high resolution GeneScan glass plates/  spacers kit, including 36cm W-T-R Glass plates (2 front/2 back),  and 36cm Spacers   HP 1200c Printer   GeneAmp PCR System 9600, including user manual, Quick Reference  Manual, Instructional Video, Consumables Start-up kit   Auto Assembler, 5-pak, user installed, includes Factura and Auto  Assembler Application software, tutorial, User and Reference  Manuals, On-line animation software, reference mouse pad   Sequence Navigator 5-pak DNA and Protein Sequence Comparison  Software, including Factura and Sequence Navigator application  software, tutorial, User and Reference Manuals    This instrumentation will be housed in an existing Departmental  Service Facility, and it will be operated by specially trained  personnel in this facility.  The daily operation of the  instrumentation will be under the direct supervision of the  Syn/Seq Facility Director, Mr. S. Kyin. The automated DNA  sequencing instrumentation in the Syn/Seq Facility will be used  to achieve four major goals.  The first is to provide efficien t  and rapid DNA sequencing.  The second is to provide a DNA  sequencing service that will benefit the entire Princeton  biological and biomedical research community.  This will include  not only all members of the Molecular Biology Department, but  also biological and biomedical research scientists in several  other Departments on campus.  These departments include  Chemistry, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Physics and Material  Sciences.  The third is to substantially reduce the time and  effort that scientists and technicians must now devote to DNA  sequencing.  The aim here is to enable members of our research  community to direct their efforts along other potentially more  productive, technically difficult and/or innovative lines of  investigation.  Fourth, the DNA Sequencing Facility will also be  incorporated in our undergraduate training programs.",
