 "awd_abstract_narration": "Software distributed shared memory (DSM) systems provide the  abstraction of shared memory to networks of workstations and  distributed memory machines, such as the Paragon, CM-5, or SP-2.  Unfortunately, the latencies for global operations in either  environment are several orders of magnitude more expensive than  on tightly-coupled multiprocessors.  The result is that  current DSMs perform well for only a restricted class of  applications.  The Sparks project is designed to address this  restriction by providing a protocol construction library that  will allow DSM performance to be improved to within a few percent  of tightly-coupled multiprocessors.  Sparks' abstractions allow  the design space of high-level synchronization operations to be  explored cleanly and systematically, rather than in an ad hoc  fashion.  The emphasis is more on creating and investigating the  abstractions that make a broad variety of optimizations possible,  rather than on the individual optimizations themselves.  However,  the performance gains allowed by the synchronization types  created via the Sparks library will be thoroughly quantified. The  Sparks interface will be implemented in CVM, a new distributed  shared memory system.  In addition to providing support services  to Sparks, CVM implements novel coherence protocols and multi-  threading support.  ***",
