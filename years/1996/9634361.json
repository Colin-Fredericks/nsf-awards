 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN:  9634361  PI:  Baras    Timbre is the percept that allows one to distinguish between musical   instruments playing the same note, or between  different  vowels  spoken   in the same voice pitch.  Only complex sounds composed of many tones have   distinct timbres or sound qualities.  The most important physical   correlate of this percept is the distribution of energy in these tones.   This energy profile resembles intuitively the distribution of light in an   image.  The question addressed in this research is how the acoustic   profile (or image) is extracted in the auditory system and how is it   represented in the brain.  Specifically, we seek to clarify  what   features of this acoustic image are important in forming the timbre of   the sound, and which features are  redundant and can be ignored.The   results obtained from such a study can potentially lead to a better   understanding of how speech and musical sounds are preceived.  This in   turn has immediate applications in the development of effective automatic   speech recognition systems, in speech and music synthesis, in robust   communication channels, and in prosthetic devices for the deaf.",
