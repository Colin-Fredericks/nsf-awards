 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are important questions which refer to gravity on very  tiny scales--scales where quantum gravity reigns--and  therefore they implicitly raise the prior question whether  spacetime is ultimately continuous or discrete.  No matter  what the answer here, discrete models of spacetime are  needed for practical reasons: for the computer simulations  which will tell us how to interpret the data coming from  gravitational wave telescopes like LIGO.  This research would address the following specific topics  within this broad framework.  The methods would be both  analytic (paper and pencil computations and derivations) and  numerical (computer simulations).       properties of black holes: does the surface of the  black hole (its `horizon`) possess a `fractal` structure, as  Newtonian analysis indicates?       discrete spacetime: further development of Regge  Calculus as a practical tool for solving the Einstein  equations numerically; further development of causal set  theory, focusing on the issues of locality and the  cosmological constant.       spacetime topology and topology-change: what are the  properties of topological geons and what happens when they  are created and destroyed?       quantum cosmology: what are the observational effects  of the time varying cosmological constant indicated by  causal set theory?       sum-over-histories approach to quantum mechanics: how  can we continue to make predictions with quantum mechanics  in the presence of gravity?",
