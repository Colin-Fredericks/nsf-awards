 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600088  Skeel    The work involves the analysis, synthesis, and testing of efficient numerical   time stepping schemes for the long-time simulation of Hamiltonian systems   of differential equations.  This is motivated by the desire to improve the   performance of computer programs that simulate the dynamics of   biomolecules, with particular attention to the MDScope simulation program   NAMD/SIgMA.  Much of the proposed work is general and applies directly   to a variety of applications modeled by Hamiltonian systems, such as   astrophysics, some structural dynamics problems, and wave propagation.    Some of the work is less general but can be adapted to other applications.    Typically, the complicated dynamics of Hamiltonian systems is a combined   effect of many simple interactions, often having a range of time scales.  A   key emphasis of the research is the development of sound \"long-timestep\"   methods, which exploit the slowness present in many components of the   motion and the possible regularity present in other components.  More   specifically, such methods evaluate some interactions at time increments   that well exceed half the period of the fast modes of the system.  Another   emphasis is the design of time stepping schemes that can compute long   trajectories having the right qualities.  A specific goal is the construction of   a multiple time stepping scheme that can be used both with long timesteps   and for long-time simulations--existing schemes fail in one respect or the   other.  Another specific goal is to reduce the cost of certain calculations,   such as inverse-square-law forces, by reducing their accuracy without   sacrificing qualitative properties.    Mathematical formulas are being devised that can predict typical motions of   large molecules such as proteins and DNA.  The aim is find shortcuts that   enable very fast calculations on large computers.  These ideas are tested for   accuracy and speed, and the more useful ones are put into the software that   biologis ts and other scientists use to study the action of molecules.    Computer simulations can help the scientist to understand how molecules   perform biological functions, which can be very difficult to observe   experimentally. Such studies are also useful in the design of molecules for   agricultural and medical purposes.  Much of the proposed work is general   and extends to other applications in which dissipation is negligible, such as   astrophysics, some structural dynamics problems, and wave propagation.",
