 "awd_abstract_narration": "CMS-9622670    The deformation of soils in the field and laboratory are  commonly observed  to concentrate in shear bands formed during failure by  strain localization.  While this mechanism is widely appreciated by geotechnical  engineers, it  remains difficult to account for this in the numerical  solutions.  This  research is the analytical/computational component of a  collaborative  research project which includes the University of Southern  California  (USC), Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), and two  French engineering  institutions - the Institute Mecanique de Grenoble (IMG) and  the Ecole  Centrale de Paris (ECP).  The research will build on the  experimental  investigations at CWRU, IMG, and ECP to develop the  analytical/computational framework for strain localization  based on finite  element implementation of gradient-dependent plasticity, and  including  account of the diffusion of pore water during undrained  tests.    The experimental and analytical program will lead to a  better understanding  of the phenomenon of bifurcation and localization, and to  analytical  methods for analyzing strain localization not only in  laboratory specimens,  but also in practical boundary value problems in  geotechnical engineering.  ***",
