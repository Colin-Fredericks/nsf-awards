Fully developed turbulence  at high Reynolds  numbers is  a  challenging problem of  fundamental importance in nonlinear physics  and  is  of  great practical importance  in  engineering. While  there  are several ways of attaining high Reynolds  number numbers,  one  of  the more attractive ways is to  use  cryogenic  gaseous  and  liquid helium as the working fluid.  This  Workshop will  bring together a group of experts on various  facets of  the turbulence  problem:   theorists and  experimentalists  on  fluid turbulence, experts on low-  temperature physics, with emphasis  on instrumentation,  users of high Reynolds  number  flow  research, etc.  The  purpose  is to discuss the future  of  high  Peynolds  number turbulence research with some (though not exclusive)  focus on  helium  as  the working fluid.  The Workshop  will  emphasize fundamental  physics  issues, but the phenomena  have  long-range technical importance in the context of  practical testing of scale models for design of aircraft of  submarines.  %%%  This  project will fund the \"International Workshop on Ultra-  High Reynolds Number Flows at Brookhaven National  Laboratory, June 18-20,  1996\".
