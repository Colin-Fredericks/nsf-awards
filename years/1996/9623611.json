Muonium  is  formed when an implanted positive muon captures an electron,  and  mimics  the  behavior of isolated  hydrogen  impurities  which  are difficult to study directly.  Data on muonium  in  Si  has  revealed   three charge states and  two  structural  configurations, along with numerous transitions among  these  states.   A  model of the muonium transition  dynamics   and  state stabilities in Si is being generalized, and parameters  obtained for Ge, GaAs, and other III-V materials.  Muon spin  resonance  and  level-crossing   resonance  spectra  provide  state identifications and give structural details, while the  magnetic-field and temperature dependences of depolarization  rates    yield  information  on  diffusion  and   transition  dynamics.  Very similar dynamic  properties of the analogous  hydrogen  centers are crucial to the efficiency of  hydrogen  passivation of shallow dopants and its effect on the device-  related electrical and optical properties of a semiconductor  material.  %%%  This research exploits the similarities between hydrogen and  muonium  (an  atom  consisting of an  electron  bound  to  a  positive  muon,  an unstable particle) in  order  to  obtain  information about the behavior of hydrogen in semiconductors  which cannot be obtained from direct studies.  Of all of the  common  impurities  in semiconductors  such  as  silicon  or  gallium arsenide, hydrogen has the most  unusual properties.  Rather  than  forming  the donors or  acceptors  which  make  semiconductor-based electronics possible, hydrogen moves  to  existing   donors   or  acceptors  and   neutralizes   them.  Consequently  hydrogen  can  very  substantially   influence  device  characteristics.  Direct investigation  of  hydrogen  impurities has severe limitations; however, muonium  studies  supply  similar  information and have been most  informative  about those  questions which are hardest to  attack directly.  The  current project extends successful muonium  studies  to  obtain  an  understanding  of processes  active  in  devices  containing hydrogen.  ***",
