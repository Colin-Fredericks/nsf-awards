 "awd_abstract_narration": "This university attracts primarily African-American students. Many students come to this department with an interest in science but, as with most college freshmen, a limited understanding of what scientists actually do and what is required to become a professional scientist. As they discover the technical nature and rigorous demands of a career in biology, many become discouraged and seek a different career, unless they are given personal instruction and encouragement and allowed to experience the excitement of using current scientific equipment successfully at the introductory biology level.   The objective of this project is to increase student interest in pursuing a biological career by providing more effective personal instruction using the Socratic method, aided by a video/microscope system, and by providing more hands-on experiences that both provide excitement and build scientific skills through the use of different kinds of scientific instruments.   The target students are the freshmen who indicate an initial interest in a biological career.  The success of this project can be indicated by increased performance on General Biology I and II examinations and reports, a greater positive attitude toward the course as expressed on course evaluation instruments, reduced student attrition during the freshman year and beyond, a higher percentage of students graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology, and a higher percentage entering biological careers.  This will result in increased representation by African-Americans in the biological professions.  The outcomes of this project will be reported before the Education Section of The Ohio Academy of Science.",
