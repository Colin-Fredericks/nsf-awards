 "awd_abstract_narration": "Development of User-Friendly Microcomputer-Based Instructional Aids for Introductory Courses in Electrical Engineering    Issues concerning advanced technological education relating to quality of learning, retention of at-risk students, and the successful availability of such programs to traditionally underrepresented groups have received national attention. Such issues are of significant concern in New Mexico and other states where a substantial number of students come from backgrounds which often include neither role models nor incentives to pursue technical careers.    This project is addressing these concerns through development, implementation, and evaluation of a program of interactive, animated software aids for enhancement of two-year technological instruction. Primary areas of attention include vector analysis of AC circuits and demonstration of electromagnetic devices and principles, which form the basis of many courses taken not only by electrical technology students but also by those in mechanical, civil, and other branches of engineering, technology, and the sciences.    Based upon extensive experience in successfully applying these techniques to upper-division and industrially related instructional programs, the developers are extending these ideas to the lower-division undergraduate technology curriculum. The project is being conducted in partnership with five two-year New Mexico institutions and two national laboratories, with New Mexico State University (NMSU) servings as the lead partner. NMSU historically attracts many students from these partner schools and is the lead university in the NSF-sponsored New Mexico Alliance for Minority Participation (AMP) program.",
