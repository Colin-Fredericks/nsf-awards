Piezoelectric films are one example of \"smart materials\".  This work if successful will truly revolutionize imaging techniques in aperture antennas, with possible ramifications for medical imaging.  This is an excellent and carefully detailed proposal which focuses on a proof of concept theoretical and experimental design involving three steps:  (1) Modeling to correlate the surface shape with the radiation pattern. This will provide strong support for concept viability in future proposals. The proposed modeling is an extension of original work which the PI has already published.  (2) Active antenna fabrication:  The central problem involves bonding of the piezoelectric film to an acceptable substrate and this will be the focus of this section.  Methods which are scaleable to industry are emphasized.  (3) Antenna surface deflection testing.  This will provide strong experimental verification of concept viability.    Successful completion of the above three steps will provide a very strong foundation for a future proposal.   A good knowledge and selection of crucial topics is evidenced by the PI.   Resources provided by Ohio State University are also excellent.  I strongly recommend funding at the proposed amount of $17,970.00.",
