 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since its introduction in the early 1980's, capillary electrophoresis (CE) has grown to become an essential tool for high resolution separations of biological macromolecules. Continuing method development has extended applications to a wide variety of charged and neutral compounds of all sizes. To be prepared for future employment and advanced schooling, students should have more than textbook knowledge of this instrumental method. To provide this experience, experiments that involve use of a CE system are being developed for three upper-level chemistry laboratories. Students in instrumental analysis are analyzing a commercial cold/sinus remedy using both reversed-phase liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis. They are observing the differences in the two separation methods and the importance of eluent character and pH. Students in the standard physical chemistry laboratory are measuring several physical parameters fundamental to the electrophoresis process. A new physical chemistry laboratory, emphasizing the properties of biological and synthetic macromolecules is being offered as an alternate to the standard course. Students who choose that option use CE to follow the kinetics of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction.",
