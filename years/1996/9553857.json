The Eddie Files is designed to be integrated into the elementary mathematics curriculum by providing teachers with resources that will engage, motivate and involve their students.  Each episode is accompanied by a teacher's guide, student activities, a related teacher enhancement video, and a set of Math at Home activities.   On-line activities serve the dual purposes of facilitating interaction among teachers and students, as well as, providing an additional distribution avenue for new lesson plans.    Major national educational improvement efforts, including the Systemic Initiatives and the National Standards movement, place a high priority on making mathematics accessible to all.  As a result of this project, upper  elementary teachers will have exemplary models of how to increase their students'  interest in mathematics and their students' knowledge of careers, by engaging their students in meaningful, complex, and mathematically rich problems  as found in The Eddie Files video tapes and accompanying ancillary materials.     The Eddie Files is designed to be integrated into the elementary mathematics curriculum for children aged 8-11.  The Eddie Files is presented from the viewpoint of a lively sixth grader.  Eddie's character is established through voice-over narration and  point of view camera shots.  We never see him, only hear his voice. In the videotaped series, Eddie and his classmates discover real-world uses of the mathematics they are studying in the classroom of East Harlem teacher, Kay Toliver.  In each of the sixteen video tapes, Ms. Toliver presents a lesson to real students and presents a workplace visit.   Eddie's mathematics assignments take him into the world beyond the classroom, where he meets a variety of professionals whose varied and challenging careers involve mathematics and s cience.",
