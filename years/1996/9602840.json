 "awd_abstract_narration": "9602840  Vermaas    This award supports the participation of 15 US scientists in  a US-Japan seminar on Advances in the Molecular Biology of  Photosynthesis, to be held at Grand Canyon National Park  from November 21 until November 25, 1996. The co-organizers  are Professor Wim Vermaas of Arizona State University and  Professor Teruo Ogawa of Nagoya University.  The theme of  the seminar was chosen to highlight recent advances in the  US and in Japan in the use of molecular genetics and genetic  engineering to elucidate processes related to  photosynthesis.  Both the utilization of unicellular model  systems and the development of appropriate techniques to  study higher-plant systems have proven to be very fruitful  to elucidate the role of particular subunits in  photosynthetic complexes and to address questions regarding  gene expression as a function of developmental stage and  nutrient and light availability.  A particularly noteworthy  effort in this area is the sequencing of the genome of a  cyanobacterium in the group of Dr. S. Tabata, who will be a  Japanese participant in the workshop.  This is the first  example of a complete genomic DNA sequence of a  photosynthetic organism, and provides the basis for a wide  spectrum of research, including the determination of the  role of genes and open reading frames and their regulatory  mechanisms.   Participants are among the most active  researchers in the area of molecular biology of  photosynthesis, and this seminar is expected to establish  and nurture collaborative research between US and Japanese  scientists who will mutually benefit from these research  ties.  ***",
