 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant funds dissertation research on the syntax of  certain dialects spoken in Northern Italy. By field work in  Italy, the student will collect data on several different verb  types. The main dialect of interest is Borgomanerese, spoken in  the province of Piedmont. In this dialect certain intransitive  verbs which share similar meanings have distinct syntactic  properties which distinguish them from all other verbs. These  properties have gone previously unnoticed because Borgomanerese  is a very little studied dialect. The special properties that  this distinct class of verbs shares are of interest to  linguistics because they constitute evidence in favor of the  hypothesis, motivated by facts from other languages, which claims  that certain aspects of verb meaning are relevant to syntactic  structure.",
