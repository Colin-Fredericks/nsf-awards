 "awd_abstract_narration": "A remote evaluation system is characterized by a client that  sends a program to a compute server for execution on its  behalf. The server returns to the client the results of  executing the program.  This is in contrast to RPC and CGI  scripts which are examples of server-side programs, not  remote evaluation.    Remote evaluation appears to be gaining currency as  evidenced by new programming languages emerging to support  it.  Among them are Telescript, Tcl, Oblique and Java.  The  download-and-execute paradigm supported by Java and Java-  compatible Web browsers is an example of remote evaluation;  in this case, however, a Web server sends a Java-enhanced  HTML file to a browser which the browser then executes.    Server security is a major problem with remote evaluation.  A server's availability, privacy and integrity must not be  compromised.  Current techniques for ensuring server  security is ad hoc.  There is no precise characterization of  what kind of security properties these techniques can  guarantee. Consequently, the typical reaction is to limit,  or in most cases prohibit altogether, an application's  access to server resources. This greatly weakens the remote  evaluation paradigm.    This research investigates the role of programming language  design and type systems in ensuring the security of servers  in remote evaluation systems.  Specifically, the long-term  objective is to develop static analyses, within the context  of type systems, to ensure that remotely-evaluated programs  do not violate a server's privacy or integrity.  Type  soundness theorems are being developed and proved with  respect to a formal semantics for a core imperative  language.  They precisely characterize the security  properties of well-typed programs written in the language.  The impact of features such as concurrency and exceptions in  a programming language on security properties is also  investigated.  ***",
