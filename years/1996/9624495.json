 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award is made in the Office of Special Projects in support of   the research and teaching activities of Dr. David Kanis at Chicago State   University. The research will focus on two main objectives. First,   methods will be developed for the calculation of the third-order    response for nonlinear optical materials. Algorithms based on the   Fenske-Hall model Hamiltonian will be developed and compared to the ZINDO   methodology for computed third-order responses. These calculations are   expected to uncover generalities governing chromophore design and   identify specific molecular structures for synthesis and   characterization. The second element of the research will focus on the   use of neural networked based artificial intelligence to screen the   ZINDO-generated database for structure-activity relationships between   nonlinear optical response and electronic  and molecular structure.   Through the CAREER plan, undergraduates will be equipped and encouraged   to attend graduate school by involving them in challenging research   projects, implementing curricular reforms and encouraging student   participation at scientific meetings. A Physical  Science lecture class   will be transformed into a participatory, discovery-based course for   nonscience majors highlighting concepts rather than procedures. Outreach   activities toward the African-American community will bring outstanding   pre-college students and high school teachers to the university to   participate in laboratory studies. A `Science in the Hood` program will   provide outreach to a segment of the urban population not typically   served by science education programs.",
