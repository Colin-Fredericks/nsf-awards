 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks cost-sharing support for the purchase of an  ABI PRISM 377 Automated DNA Sequencer and necessary peripherals.  The Lewis B. and Dorothy Cullman Program for Molecular  Systematics Studies, which is a joint initiative of The New York  Botanical Garden and the American Museum of Natural History, was  formed through a charitable donation from the Lewis B. and  Dorothy Cullman Foundation. The New York Botanical Garden's  Cullman Program occupies laboratories at both locations, which  includes entitlement to user-fee based operation of the Museum's  ABI 377 sequencer. The Cullman Program resides primarily in newly  renovated laboratory space in the Garden's Harding Laboratory  building. A matching challenge grant of $116,000 from the Cullman  Foundation has been used toward the total costs of equipping the  new laboratories for molecular systematics research. This  proposal requests the balance of necessary funds from the NSF.         This proposal seeks matching funds from NSF to complete  the planned equipping of the Garden laboratories with automated  DNA sequencing and DNA fingerprinting capacities. DNA sequencing  is not currently possible at the Garden, although all other  relevant molecular techniques (e.g., DNA and RNA extraction and  purification, Southern and northern blot analyses, PCR  amplification of DNA, in situ hybridization and in situ PCR  against DNA or cDNA, visualization of fluorochrome labeled in  situ probes, and molecular cloning) are supported with the newly  purchased equipment. The sequencing facility at the American  Museum is crucial for present research initiatives, but it is no  long term substitute for in-house DNA sequence and DNA  fingerprint determination at the Garden. Aspects such as  cost-effectiveness, throughput, flexibility, and enhanced  research and educational development argue strongly for the  Garden's completion of its own automated DNA analysis facility,  as has been planned.         The general goal of the Cullman Program is to enr ich and  invigorate the Botanical Science Division of The New York  Botanical Garden with the modern tools of molecular systematics  research. Molecular systematics not only entails DNA sequence  production for use in phylogenetic analysis; it also encompasses  bold new attempts to link systematics reasoning with the  burgeoning field of plant molecular development. The Cullman  Program currently supports standard molecular systematics  projects as well as systematically oriented projects focusing on  flower and root development. Molecular systematic work in  Lecythidaceae, Arecaceae, Anacardiaceae, Neckeraceae,  Gentianaceae, and Cactaceae is proceeding in collaboration with  Cullman Program Adjunct Curators, other staff, and graduate  students. These projects are primarily oriented toward  classificatory, character evolutionary, and biogeographic issues.  Other projects focusing on population level issues will profit  from the ABI 377's capacity to perform rapid genotype analysis  (e.g., using the amplified fragment length polymorphism  AFLP   approach). Likewise, the evolutionary-oriented developmental  research of the Cullman Program requires active DNA sequencing  capacity. A Garden sequencing facility will act much like a local  workstation for plant molecular systematics activity, especially  given the Garden's academic collaborations with Columbia  University (The Center for Environmental Conservation and  Research--CERC), Cornell University, Lehman College--CUNY, New  York University, and Yale University. Immediate commitments for  use of an automated sequencer are substantial (16 investigators),  and installation of this instrumentation at The New York  Botanical Garden should permit a considerable molecular  systematics research capacity in the years to come.         The ABI PRISM 377 Automated DNA Sequencer (manufactured by  Perkin Elmer's Applied Biosystems Division) is a sophisticated  instrument representing the forefront of second-generation  sequencer technology. The instrument' s use of simultaneous,  scanning-laser detection of four different fluorescent dyes  permits samples to be resolved in single gel lanes (as opposed to  the four gel lanes occupied by other vendors' equipment, which  have a single-dye approach). Throughput time has been increased  by a factor four from earlier models through refinements to the  scanning procedure. Combined with appropriate software (some  software and hardware are included within the base purchase  price), gel-plate and loading comb combinations, apparatus for  PCR-based DNA labeling, and a dedicated water purification  system, the ABI 377 will complete the equipping of The New York  Botanical Garden's molecular laboratories.",
