The  MRSEC is a collaborative activity between researchers at a number  of institutions in the New York metropolitan area, including  Brookhaven National Laboratory, Polytechnic University, Queens  College, Lehman College, and two industrial research and  development centers.  The research is carried out in one  interdisciplinary research group.  The focus of the Center is the  design of polymer thin film properties through precise control of  interfacial structure.  A central goal of the Center is to  address technological problems related to polymer thin films, and  to develop cutting-edge enabling technologies that take existing  polymeric systems and markedly improve their properties. The  MRSEC supports the development, operation and maintenance of  shared experimental facilities for materials research.  It  provides seed funding for exploratory  research  and emerging  areas, and fosters research participation by undergraduates. The  MRSEC has strong industrial links and an educational outreach  program from the pre-college to the graduate level. The Center  currently  supports 12 senior investigators, 3 postdoctoral  research associates, 10 graduate students, and 6 undergraduates.  The MRSEC is directed by Professor Miriam Rafailovich.  %%%  This Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at  the University of New York at Stony Brook supports research in  the area of polymer thin films at engineered interfaces.
