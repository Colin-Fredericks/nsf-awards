 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Richard W. Pohl Conservatory is a resource facility that is central to the research and research training mission of the Botany Department and to basic Plant Biology programs at Iowa State University.  Located on the roof of Bessey Hall,  the Conservatory provides the primary plant growth facilities for research in ecology, evolutionary biology, molecular biology, and biotechnology. In addition, the facility houses the second largest greenhouse collection of plant species west of the Mississippi River. Funding from the National Science Foundation will be used to convert an outdated greenhouse containing inadequate and decaying facilities into a state-of-the-art research plant facility.  A portion of the space will be modified specifically for biotechnology and transgenic plant research.  Obsolete environmental controls and utility infrastructure will be updated with integrated regulators.  The leaky and precarious glass roof and side panels will be replaced with modern materials and will be reglazed.  A renovated facility will enhance the Department's ability to conduct transgenic plant research and training in a conducive and safe working environment.  The significance of this project extends beyond Iowa State to national and international levels by the numerous and varied research programs that involve collaborations which directly or indirectly use the facility.  It is anticipated that these collaborations will continue to increase as unique genetic plant materials are created and grown in the renovated greenhouse.  In conjunction to genetically engineered plants, the conservatory collection represents a unique source for plant species that is not available anyplace else in the world. Plant materials are regularly supplied to research laboratories around the world and this project will maintain this vital scientific resource and enhance the role of the conservatory in future years.",
