 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to better prepare the engineers for modern day technology, several enhancements are planned for the Mechanics of Deformable Bodies Laboratory.  The project has three goals: (a) to introduce the students to tests for dynamic loading, e.g. reversed cycle fatigue tests, (b) to simulate a real-life situation in the laboratory by tasking the students with the design and performance of their own tests that will characterize a new material or a product, and (c) to train the students in the use of industry standard testing equipment, and automatic data acquisition system. In order to successfully meet these goals, the lab will be augmented with a versatile material testing machine that is equipped with automatic control features, and a PC based data acquisition system for real-time data recording and analysis.                  The Mechanics of Deformable Bodies Lab is a requirement for both Mechanical and Civil Engineering majors.  Mechanical Engineering is the largest department in the college, and the combined student population of mechanical and Civil Engineering departments is more than 50 percent of all the engineering students enrolled.  Given the large number of students that are required to take this course and the fraction of them who are women (25 %) and minorities (15 %), the enhancement of the lab is imperative and its impact will be truly significant",
