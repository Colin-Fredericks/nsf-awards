It offers analytical descriptions and a typological classification of the forms of law and political organization in the Islamic Middle East before the impact of modern constitutionalism. It then focuses on the legal consequences of modernizing change and the undermining of constitutionalism in the legal and political traditions of the Islamic Middle East that resulted from these changes.  Public and constitutional law will be considered the critical link between political organization and the legal system. The modernizers' attempts at rational political reconstruction and legal reform invoked support, resistance and counter-proposals among different social forces and vested institutional interests which engaged in a political struggle that determined constitutional change at decisive turning points.  The method for this study is comparative, and uses a historically circumscribed typology to account for the variations, in time and across countries, of the constitutional outcomes and political regimes in the Islamic Middle East.",
