 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is expanding the education of undergraduate chemists, biochemists (BCMs), and nonmajors, starting with biochemistry/physical chemistry implementation. It enhances student independence and teamwork in advanced labs and capstone research courses. Outcomes include department seminars and presentations at scientific meetings. A very solid life science connection is shown by near-doubled numbers of majors since the 1991 beginning of the BCM program. The department hopes to pass students through a curriculum rich in blended physical, biological, and organic chemistry techniques. This approach stimulates student interest; interrelates the biological, physical, and organic components; gives students largely unavailable expertise in relevant modern chemistry techniques; and enlarges their desirability as higher education and employment candidates. The first use of the DNA sequencer, scanning calorimeter, and protein electrophoresis units will be biochemistry- and medicinal-chemistry-based DNA exploration; reinforcement of the thermodynamic and kinetic concepts related to polymers; and the study and purification of enzymes. Each planned study aspect is set into broad, integrated lab experiments. The project also trains undergraduates in related research methods. Other chemistry faculty can also use the equipment in their courses and training agendas. So, the program helps to enhance science infrastructure quality.",
