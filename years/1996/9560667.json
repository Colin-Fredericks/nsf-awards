 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will evaluate various fabrication techniques to develop a three layer `super thin film composite` membrane with both high selectivity and high flux. At present this firm has demonstrated an ability to fabricate thin films (less than .5 micron) of glassy fluoropolymer onto microporous supports. By placing a super thin layer (50A to 200A) of high selectivity polymer on top of our non-porous glass fluoropolymer, the firm expects to fabricate membranes with both high selectivity and high flux. Techniques to establish this super thin layer (50A to 200A) include (a) chemical modification of surface, (b) coating of ultrathin layer on surface and (c) densification of top layer. To date, this concept has been very limited in that stable, high flux, high free volume non-porous membranes did not exist. In Phase I the firm will demonstrate the concept of super thin film composites.  New glassy, high free volume fluoropolymers are described which show very high permeability to permeant gases, low permeability to volatile organics, good selectivity and excellent stability. The glassy nature allows easy fabrication into high flux non-porous thin film membranes. These unique fluoropolymers allow fabrication of novel and valuable membrane structures.  Based on the excellent film forming capability, excellent gas flux and high selectivity of this glassy fluoropolymer, applications include production of oxygen enriched air for (I) industrial applications (i.e. glass/steel), (2) enhanced automotive power, fuel efficiency and reduced pollution, and (3) enhanced heating efficiency. The excellent chemical stability will be used in harsh chemical gas separations like H2/Cl2 in chlor-alkali processes or HF-fluorine separations.",
