 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research component of this project will result in the  design and development of portable parallel software for  solving architectural-level optimization problems that arise  in the design of VLSI systems.  Several of these problems  can be formulated as very large scale integer programs that  can be solved in polynomial time using iterative relaxation  techniques. The practical running times of these algorithms  on serial computers can be prohibitively long, however,  especially for interactive design environments.  The  scaleable parallel software developed in this project will  be able to execute orders of magnitude faster than  conventional serial code.  It will thus enable VLSI  designers to interactively explore their design space at an  early stage in the design process and to efficiently  consider several architectural alternatives before  committing to any particular implementation.    The educational part of this project aims at the seamless  integration of parallel computation in the undergraduate and  graduate curriculum.  To that effect, two new courses will  be developed at Yale.  The first course will introduce  undergraduates to the basics of serial and parallel computer  systems organization.  The second course will cover  algorithms for computer-aided design of VLSI systems with a  research  focus on parallel electronic design  automation. ***",
