This will be the third in a series and will build on the FARNET/NTTF joint meeting on April 15 and16 in Washington, DC as well as the  Monterey workshop on the NII and Higher Education in Sept. 1995.  The earlier meetings convened members of leading higher education, research and supporting organizations to better understand the needs and requirements of higher education for  advanced networking.  The participants at the Monterey conference  in September of 1995, were in general agreement that    1) the requirements for communications for tomorrow1s university are not clearly articulated and    2) leadership, and perhaps services exclusively from the private sector are not likely to provide the solution.    These conclusions spawned a number activities addressing both issues.  A number of draft strategy documents addressing the fulfillment of those needs and requirements were presented at the April 15-16 Washington, DC meeting.  Our objectives at the  Colorado Springs-Cheyenne Mountain Resort workshop will be to further develop and evaluate those models, discuss and evaluate critical technical issues, and discuss alliances and organizational structure to implement the strategy.",
