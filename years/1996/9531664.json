 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  Smith  The Research Experiences for Undergraduates site at the Rice  Quantum Institute of Rice University will be continued.  The  main objective of the program is to provide undergraduate  students with an opportunity to observe and participate in  research in a highly-interdisciplinary university research  environment with strong faculty support.  The program has,  and will continue to focus on active participation in  research, but also strives to show the participants how the  research funding process works, give them insight into  applications of basic research, and provide them with an  understanding of the fundamental motivations for research  activity.  Each undergraduate becomes affiliated with one of  the 25 research groups at the Quantum Institute, and works  on an independent project that he/she can bring to  completion in the allotted ten-week time frame.  In addition  to research activities, a special seminar series for the  participants is organized in which invited speakers deal  with topics ranging from \"hot\" topics in research,  commercial applications of basic research, entrepreneurship,  graduate schools, opportunities for employment, and other  topics.  ***",
