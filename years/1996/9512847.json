 "awd_abstract_narration": "Purchase of an automated 15N, 13C analyzer for the University of Texas  Marine Science Institute to replace a >25 year old isotope ratio mass  spectrometer and associated high vacuum sample preparation lines is  proposed. Although tens of thousands of samples have been analyzed  using the present system, it is currently inoperable and requires a  major overhaul. However, because of the system's age, its relatively  primitive technology, and demand by several users, any repairs to the  instrument are unlikely to be cost effective over the long term or meet  the expectations of the scientific research staff at the Institute.  Instead, the purchase of a new analyzer represents a substantial  advance in technological capabilities which will open additional  avenues of research for the scientists at the Institute as well as  providing isotopic data for currently funded research programs. The  proposed and currently funded research avenues include microbiological,  ecological, physiological and chemical studies. This research will use  the stable isotope compositions of bioactive elements, such as C and N,  to delineate metabolic pathways, understand food webs in natural  environments, and determine the sources, transformations and fates of  these elements in ecosystems. The proposed analyzer is a compact  instrument which determines the carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios of  gases, solids and liquids in their natural state with minimal sample  preparation. Expensive and time consuming sample preparation on high  vacuum lines with subsequent transfer of purified sample gases to a  mass spectrometer is avoided in the proposed system since sample  processing and isotopic analysis are integrated into one unit. An  additional advantage of the proposed system over those presently  available to Institute scientists is that samples with natural  abundance of the 13C and 15N isotopes as well as isotopically amended  samples used in tracer studies can be analyzed on one instrument.",
