The research will study the variation of  spectroscopic signatures from high temperatures to low  temperatures.  Of particular interest is the onset of low  frequency dynamics at lower temperatures.  In addition,  tests will be made of the spectroscopic predictions of  several recent theories of the liquid-glass transition.  The  glasses to be studied will have different fragility  parameters because of composition or as a result of imposed  variations in hydrostatic pressure.  The project should lead  to a better understanding of the relationship between the  topology of connected, random networks, and the strength of  individual bonds and vibrational dynamics.  The research is  fundamental in character but the results are potentially of  great practical interest because of the many applications of  amorphous and glass-like materials.  %%%  Amorphous solids or glasses are challenging objects for  study because of their complex network structures.  They are  of great practical interest because of their many commercial  applications.  Glasses have many properties that differ from  those of ordered crystals.  This project will use  spectroscopic techniques to study the low frequency  vibrational properties of glasses and to relate these  measurements to the structural conformation of the  materials.  Because the atomic structure of the glass is  formed at high temperatures and because the glass is a  frozen liquid, the transition from the liquid to the glass  state will be followed as a  function of temperature - from  high temperature to low temperatures.  This should lead to a  better understanding of the vibrational dynamics of  disordered networks.  The results should have general  applicability to other more general disordered networks such  as the brain or as developed in economic models.  ***",
