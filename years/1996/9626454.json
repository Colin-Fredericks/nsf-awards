 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Wayne W. Lukens  has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research   Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Lukens received the doctoral degree from   the University of California at Berkeley under the supervision of   Professor Richard Andersen.  Dr. Lukens will continue research at the   University of California at Santa Barbara under the sponsorship of   Professor Galen Stucky.  The postdoctoral research will focus on the   study of transition metal substituted mesoporous silicates.  The goal is   to specifically substitute transition metals for framework silicon atoms   at the surface of the pores.  Because of the substitution, the spectra of   the metal center, especially the EXAFS spectra, may be more   straightforwardly interpreted in characterization of the mesoporous   materials.  The longterm goal is to prepare and characterize   organometallic catalysts which are able to perform sequential reactions   such as carbonylation followed by ring-closing metathesis.  The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as   an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge   and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in   contemporary chemical research and teaching.",
