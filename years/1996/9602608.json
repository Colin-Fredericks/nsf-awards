 "awd_abstract_narration": "Located in rural upstate New York near the Canadian broader, Clarkson University, founded 100 years ago, has earned a reputation for providing talented men and women with a  quality private education in engineering, science and management.  Although regarded as a small university, Clarkson has a large engineering program.  Presently, the School of Engineering is dispersed among two campuses in five different buildings.  This  arrangement has interfered with the development of interdisciplinary research opportunities. Sufficient space is now available to consolidate the entire School of Engineering in a single interconnected complex on one campus.  Funding from the National Science Foundation, with resources from the institution, will allow for the relocation to and renovation of research and training space in CAMP and Rowley Halls.  Underutilized laboratories will be renovated and remodeled to provide flexible and efficient usage of space.  Modern utilities systems will be installed, in addition to the replacement of workbenches and walls. The new building's configuration will maximize interdisciplinary contacts and collaborations, and establish shared equipment facilities.  This organization will eradicate any barriers that may have existed between faculty research, research training, and undergraduate education.  Creation of a multidisciplinary environment for research and research training will enable the institution to better prepare students to meet the engineering challenges of the next century.",
