Students will participate in the formation and  characterization of thin organic films and interfaces of  materials that are important for subsequent generations of  liquid crystal display, sensors, and lubricants for magnetic  recording.        This program will capitalize on the resources and  personnel of the Center on Polymer Interfaces and  Macromolecular Assemblies (CPIMA).  CPIMA is a partnership  of research groups from Stanford University, IBM Almaden  Research Center, and the University of California, Davis.  Undergraduate participants in the program will have the  unique opportunity to work in a world-class university or  corporate research laboratory.  The participants for this  program will primarily be recruited from national non  research oriented universities and colleges and regional  community colleges.  Distinct efforts will be made to  recruit women and minority students.  %%%      To give the students a well rounded experience and to  equip them with the practical skills needed to enter  graduate school or the corporate sector, several  professional enhancement programs, such as tours of global  R&D laboratories and seminars by scientists and graduate  students on their professional and personal experiences have  been incorporated into this program.  High-tech Silicon  Valley and the opportunities offered in the San Francisco  Bay Area are an added feature.  Social activities are also  planned to give the students a `flavor' for graduate student  life and to help them in forming a support network.  ***",
