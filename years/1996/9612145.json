 "awd_abstract_narration": "Williams  9612145    This proposal requests an award to continue the progress begun by the NSF/TRP award which established SCCEME and to institutionalize the Coalition as a close, symbiotic linkage between Southern California industries, the SCCEME universities, and local community colleges.  The emphasis will continue to be on manufacturing in the modern integrated product and process development environment.    The Southern California Coalition for Education in Manufacturing Engineering (SCCEME) proposes to disseminate and institutionalize the products and successes of the Coalition through a new, permanent non-profit (501c3) organization, the Foundation for the Advancement of Manufacturing Education (FAME), to continue and enhance its regional Southern California industry/university partnership for improving manufacturing education and training.  A primary mission of FAME is to continue to foster manufacturing excellence in the region through providing advanced manufacturing training and education at the factory floor through multimedia educational delivery.  The development of multimedia software and training programs for industry will continue to occur through a partnership between the California universities and community colleges in cooperation with industry.    FAME is controlled by a Board of Directors dominated by executives of industries that have participated with the SCCEME universities to establish SCCEME.  Under the direction of FAME, SCCEME will enhance manufacturing engineering education and provide engineering and technical training to the shop floor of manufacturing firms, primarily through multimedia-based courses and course modules and secondarily through remote classroom activities.  Multimedia delivery of manufacturing education and training to the factory floor will be both necessary and effective as a means of gaining and maintaining high quality, low cost manufacturing that is competitive in a global economy.  FAME will provide both industry and the higher educational i nstitutions in Southern California with the focus, capability and financing to carry out this major transformation in how manufacturing education and training is delivered.    The financing of FAME activities will be through federal and State support, industrial purchase of training activities, and other sources as appropriate.  The NSF is requested to provide support for SCCEME to facilitate the transition of SCCEME from NSF support to other sources of support under the direction of FAME.",
