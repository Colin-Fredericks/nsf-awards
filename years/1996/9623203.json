 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623203  Chen    This proposal is directed toward research on nonlinear problems in fluid   mechanics and related partial differential equations, along with the analysis   and development of efficient nonlinear methods. The objective of this   proposed research program is threefold: investigate important   multidimensional nonlinear problems such as geometric flows, transonic   flows, and the Riemann problem to find the correct function spaces in which   to pose the multidimensional hyperbolic conservation laws and in which to   develop the numerical algorithms that converge stably and rapidly; analyze   and develop existing shock capturing methods and related potential   techniques to formulate new, more efficient nonlinear methods and to solve   global solutions of the nonlinear systems; probe in the regularizing   mechanism for nonlinear partial differential equations to gain new physical   insights and to guide the formulation of the efficient nonlinear methods.    The nonlinear problems arise in all areas of science and engineering. In   particular, they arise in material sciences, biophysics, and environmental   and global change processes, in which fluid motions are essential features.   Such features are predominant in such areas as elasticity, plasticity,   semiconductor, biological transport of ions, phase transition, multi-phase   process, and combustion. The fluid motions are generally governed by the   principles of fluid mechanics and, in turn, by certain nonlinear systems of   partial differential equations.  Understanding solutions of such nonlinear   systems enables ones to understand the corresponding fluid motions, to gain   new physical insights, to discover the intrinsic laws in these areas. The   proposed nonlinear problems include the well-posedness of solutions of   these nonlinear systems and the qualitative behavior of new nonlinear   phenomena as well as the analysis and development of numerical   computational methods and related potential nonlinear methods.",
