Although the students had  very little knowledge of mathematics and physics, the approach  adopted was similar in all respects to that pioneered with second-  year physics students at an excellent suburban school during a  previous NSF-supported project. The results, too, were similar-a  striking finding given the disparity in preparation of the two  student populations. This indicates that the use of advanced  educational technology, coupled with research-based pedagogy, may  have an even more dramatic effect in inner-city schools than in the  suburban ones in which it has traditionally been applied. The aim  of the proposed project is to acquire and communicate hard evidence  bearing on this conclusion.  ***",
