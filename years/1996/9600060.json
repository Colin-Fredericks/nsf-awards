Unlike traditional homogeneous turbulence  theory, these models capture the essential features of the long-lived,  large-scale structures that form in the process of turbulent  relaxation.  Moreover, they furnish definite macroscopic equations for  the coherent structures that persist amidst the microscopic disorder.  The proposed investigations address the formulation, justification and  solution of these statistical equilibrium models.  The goal of the  work is to answer fundamental questions about prototype models drawn  from hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics.  Both analytical and  numerical methods are employed.  On the theoretical side, continuum  and lattice models are constructed, and their properties are  established using a synthesis of x-space and k-space methods.  This  approach is expected to yield new theories of turbulent relaxation for  uniform and stratified fluids, and incompressible magnetofluids in two  and three dimensions.  On the computational side, optimization methods  are designed to solve the constrained maximum entropy problems that  govern the various models.  These numerical methods are implemented to  reveal the predictions of the models, especially in settings where  experiments or simulations are available for comparison.    %%%    Turbulent fluid flow remains one of the unsolved puzzles of physical  science.  A satisfactory theoretical understanding of it would  provide much more powerful means of computing the behavior of fluid  motions than is presently available.  Such computations are needed in  numerous applied fields, from aerodynamic design to weather  prediction.  Similarly, the modeling of plasmas (hot, ionized gases),  such as arise in fusion energy research, requires a theory of  turbulence for electrically-conducting fluids in magnetic fields.  The  proposed work see ks to develop the mathematical tools necessary to  calculate the persistent, predominant states of these fluid and  magnetofluid systems without resolving the full complexity of their  detailed behavior.  Tools of this kind, which are built from basic  concepts in statistical physics, are currently available only   in some simplified systems.  The motivation for the investigations is to  extend the range of applications of these tools and to support them  by complete theories and effective computational methods.       ***",
