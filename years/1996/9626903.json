 "awd_abstract_narration": "Goldston 9626903  The distribution of primes in various sequences of integers is of  critical importance in Number Theory. The study of this distribution uses both multiplicative and additive number theory. Some of the tools  utilized include the circle method, exponential sums, sieves, and the zeta function methods. This project will continue earlier work on obtaining lower bounds for pairs of primes in various sequences. The method uses short divisor sums and has connections with all of the  aforementioned tools. The investigator will further develop and generalize this method. He will also examine applications to primes in arithmetic  progressions and multiple correlations of primes. A related topic is to obtain asymptotic results when averaging is available. In addition, the  investigator will study certain problems involving the power sum method; these problems are well suited to an undergraduate institution.     This research falls into the general mathematical field of Number Theory.  Number theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers,  addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one  whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and  was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within  the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse  applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and  communication systems.",
