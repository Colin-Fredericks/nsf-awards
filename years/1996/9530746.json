 "awd_abstract_narration": "95-30746  BENDER    This research project is part of the US Joint Global Ocean Flux  Study (JGOFS) Southern Ocean Program aimed at (1) a better  understanding of the fluxes of carbon, both organic and  inorganic, in the Southern Ocean, (2) identifying the physical,  ecological and biogeochemical factors and processes which  regulate the magnitude and variability of these fluxes, and (3)  placing these fluxes into the context of the contemporary global  carbon cycle.    One of the primary goals of the JGOFS program in general, and of  the Southern Ocean initiative in particular, is to constrain the  carbon flux in order to evaluate whether this region is a net  sink or source of carbon. Interest in this program is directed  towards gaining an understanding of the environmental factors  that affect rates of primary production and the extrapolation of  these rates over broad spatial and temporal scales.  Research will focus on using oxygen to constrain carbon fluxes on  three scales; large, meso and local.    1) For the large scale, air samples will be collected and the  O2/N2 ratio will be measured. Oxygen concentrations in the  atmosphere vary on seasonal time scales due to primary production  in the spring and summer months and ventilation of the ocean in  the fall and winter. Thus knowledge of the amplitude of the O2/N2  signal will provide a measure of the magnitude and timing of net  production for the Southern Ocean.  Air samples will be collected  daily from ships that will participate in the JGOFS experiment to  have high resolution records of zonal and temporal variations of  the atmospheric oxygen field over the Southern Ocean.    2) Similarly, net primary productivity will be determined from  the mesoscale oxygen field in two ways: first by measurement of  O2/Ar ratios and del 18O of O2 in seawater collected from the  mixed layer and second by continually measuring subsurface oxygen  concentrations along the cruise track. These two approaches,  together with the air sampling program, wi ll provide a temporally  and spatially integrated estimate of net production.    3) Carbon flow will be constrained by undertaking daily  measurements of gross and net oxygen production, and nitrate  assimilation. Gross oxygen production is calculated by spiking  and incubating seawater samples with 18O-labelled water and  measuring the del 18O of the photosynthetically produced oxygen.  Net oxygen production is measured by comparing the relative  change in the oxygen concentration between initial and incubated  samples by automated high precision Winkler titrations. These  measurements will provide daily depth integrated gross and net  production rates in addition to respiration rates. Furthermore,  photosynthesis-irradiance experiments will measure gross and net  production during cruises to extrapolate local measurements up to  meso and large scale using bio-optical data from moorings and  satellites.",
