The broad continental shelf of the Ross Sea is characterized by  relatively high biomass with large phytoplankton blooms in the  austral spring-summer.  This region has been designated as an  area for intensive process studies as part of the U.S. JGOFS  comprehensive investigative program of carbon and biogenic fluxes  in the Southern Ocean.  As part of that effort, this study is  designed to assess the rates of new and regenerated production in  the Ross Sea continental shelf regime during the productive  growing season in Antarctica (spring, summer, autumn).    The overall objectives of this study  are to obtain accurate and  quantitative estimates of the nitrogenous nutrition of the  planktonic assemblages in this dynamic system, and to understand  the factors which control the magnitude and variability of  primary production and the vertical flux of biogenic material  from the euphotic zone (i.e. export production).  A suite of core  measurements will be made to estimate new and regenerated  production over relevant spatial and temporal scales.  New  production in the Ross Sea is hypothesized as a function of the  evolution of the ecosystems' development and thus regulated by:  the hydrodynamic properties of the water column (i.e. vertical  stability from ice melt), the interaction of macronutrients  (ammonium and urea), and the availability  of the micronutrient  iron.  Core measurements include determining the uptake rates of  four nitrogen substrates (nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, and urea)  using the 15N-tracer technique; a t stations distributed along  transects from the ice-edge (marginal ice zone), across the  shelf, slope, and into the open ocean; with measurements at seven  depths ranging from 100% to 1% of surface irradiance; during  morning, mid-day and night.  The degree of isotopic dilution  will be quantified during nitrogen uptake experiments to more  accurately determine rates of uptake, and to estimate rates of  microheterotrophic nitrogen regeneration.    In addition to the core measurements additional experiments will  answer specific questions about the system, and will refine our  estimates of new and regenerated production.",
