The focus will be on structures located in environments where water can be as damaging as the fire, and typical chemical suppression systems is hazardous to occupant health or is polluting to the environment Phase I will demonstrate the proof-of-concept.  If approved, Phase II will optimize and field test the novel technology, while Phase III will commercialize the technology.       The proposed innovation can lead to fire suppression technology for structures where water and conventional chernical suppressants are unsuitable. Furthermore, the proposed technology can help reduce billions of dollars that is lost every year in fire and intangibles associated with the property. The technology also has applications in growing applications such as fire suppression for microelectronics products.",
