The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will fund a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit which will allow Dr. Nigatu Tadesse to work with Dr.  S. Rajaram at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement  Center (CIMMYT) in Mexico.    The goal of this research is to explain the inheritance of  osmoregulation, relative water content, and excised leaf  water retention (plant-water relations) as droughtresistance  mechanisms in wheat.  The objectives are:  1) to identify  and map the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) of plantwater  relations; and 2) to determine if there is a genetic  relationship between plant-water relations traits and yield  under water stress environments.  The long-term goals of the  project are to develop marker-based selection tools to  facilitate selection for drought-resistant wheat genotypes  and provide a linkage map that will enable map based cloning  for plant-water relations genes.    ***",
