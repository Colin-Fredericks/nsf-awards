Unfortunately, quantization is not a straightforward proposition, as  evidenced by the discovery, exactly fifty years ago, by Groenewold and Van  Hove of an ``obstruction'' to quantization. Their ``no-go theorem'' asserts  that in principle it is impossible to consistently quantize every classical  observable on a Euclidean phase space, regardless of which quantization  procedure is employed. Just this past year, the principal investigator  proved that a similar result holds for the sphere. But no-go theorems are  not  universally valid; the principal investigator has recently shown that  the torus admits a consistent full quantization. The goals of this proposal  are to delineate the circumstances under which such obstructions will  appear, and to study the underlying mechanisms which produce them. Another  problem, when an obstruction does exist, is to determine the maximal  subalgebras of observables that can be consistently quantized. Solutions to  these problems might be used to refine extant quantization procedures, or  design new ones, which are adapted to the obstruction in that they will be  able to quantize these maximal subalgebras. From a mathematical standpoint,  this research will lead to structural insights into the Poisson algebras of  classical systems and their representations.  %%%            Although the universe is quantum mechanical in nature, our  perceptions of it are rooted in classical physics. Thus one is often  confronted with the problem of constructing a quantum formulation of a  system from a knowledge of a classical approximation to it. This process is  called \"quantization,'' and over the years many different quantization  schemes have been developed. Unfortunately, quantization is not a  straightforward proposition, as ev idenced by the discovery, exactly fifty  years ago, of an \"obstruction'' to quantization. This \"no-go theorem''  asserts that in principle it is impossible to consistently quantize a  (nonrelativistic) particle, regardless of which quantization procedure is  employed. Just this past year, the principal investigator proved a similar  result for a spinning particle. But no-go theorems are not universally  valid; the principal investigator recently found a classical system which  admits a consistent quantization. The goals of this proposal are to  delineate the circumstances under which such obstructions will appear, and  to study the mechanisms which produce them. A solution to this problem  might be used to refine extant quantization procedures, or design new ones,  which are \"optimal\" in that they will be able to quantize systems to the  extent permitted by the obstruction.  ***",
