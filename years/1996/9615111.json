This is research empirically investigates  fundamental principles of how organizations and communities  emerge in large-scale networked computing environments.  The  dynamic structure of communities through time will be  revealed by capturing empirical data about growth and change  in links among nodes in regions of the Internet. These data  will be analyzed for structural and temporal patterns,  linked to explanatory phenomena, and used to develop new  theoretical models. In order to gather data and perform  measurements on community topology and dynamics, new probes  and instrumentation will be developed and deployed on the  Net. This research is especially innovative, first, in that  it will develop new tools for gathering and analyzing data  on organizational activity and network dynamics directly  from the Internet at large. This begins to provide a new  kind of research infrastructure that opens up the Internet  as a research tool, as a rich source of empirical data on  large-scale organizing phenomena, and as a source of data on  very-large-scale network dynamics in general. Second, it  will provide exciting empirically-derived models and  theories of dynamic phenomena such as communities and  organizations in very large scale electronic environments.  The phenomena uncovered in the data alone can serve as  valuable tests of and challenges to existing models derived  from analysis, simulation, or extrapolation from smaller-  scale models. The models built to explain that data promise  to drive empirical theories of network dynamics to new areas  and to inform other fields.  ***",
