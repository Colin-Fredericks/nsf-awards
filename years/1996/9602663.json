 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Physical Science (PS) complex houses the Departments of Chemistry and Physics on the campus of Oklahoma State University in Stillwater.  Built in two parts, 1958 (PS I) and 1969 (PS II) respectively, the structure has deteriorated badly from heavy service.  Some space is not suitable for research involving experimental chemistry because it does not meet current building and safety codes, and in general violates standards for chemical research laboratories.  Research laboratories are substandard in fume hood ventilation capability, HVAC service, electrical systems, explosion proof and hazardous chemical storage facilities, ventilated plumbing systems, and outdated laboratory casings.  The Chemistry Department is confronting a critical period regarding the maintenance of its present level of research productivity.  Senior faculty are retiring, and it will be difficult to replace them with young faculty  if modern and safe laboratory facilities are not available.  Renovated laboratories are necessary in order to attract and retain faculty needed to sustain the Department's current program status.  Funding from the ARI Program will assist OSU in its endeavor to renovate a portion of space in PS I and PS II to comply with standards required for personnel safety and scientific research.  In addition, renovations will entail removal of asbestos containing material, installation of new plumbing and electrical services,  new acoustical ceilings to reduce noise levels, and new solvent safety cabinets. Four research groups investigating the following will be affected:  inorganic chemistry and material science, organic and polymer chemistry, analytical chemistry, and bioanalytical chemistry.  Joint funding by the NSF and OSU will ensure that a safe research facility with markedly enhanced capabilities to conduct research and research training will be provided.  OSU and the Department of Chemistry seek to establish a basis for continued growth in quality and multidisciplinary research.  This ARI project will improve the institution's ability to provide the type of environment that will foster this growth.",
