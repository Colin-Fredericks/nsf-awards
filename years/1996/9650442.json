 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns the purchase of an atomic absorption spectrometer, which has the capability of both flame and graphite furnace atomization. This instrument can be used in a wide variety of introductory courses, both major and nonmajor, as well as in upper division courses and undergraduate research. Because atomic absorption is such a widely accepted method, students are learning how modern instruments are used in analytical and environmental laboratories in the 1990s, including computer interfacing and control.    Specifically, experiments are planned for the Environmental Chemistry and Perspectives in Nutrition nonmajor courses; Equilibrium and Analysis and General Chemistry (Accelerated) Laboratory science major introductory courses; and the Inorganic/Physical Chemistry Lab, Instrumental Analysis, and student/faculty research projects in the upper-division courses.    It is important that both introductory and advanced students get first-hand experience with this instrument in order to understand the advantages and limitations of the atomic absorption method. The graphite furnace enables detection of many elements in the parts per billion to trillion range, which is the level of occurrence of trace metals in many environmental and biological samples.",
