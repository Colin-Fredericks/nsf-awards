 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposal, funds are being requested for the  acquisition, setup, and maintenance of a number of pieces of  equipment used for the analysis of primary and secondary  chemicals found in plants. Specific items include a high-pressure  liquid chromatography HPLC) unit, accessories to a low-pressure  liquid column (LC) chromatography apparatus, a centrifuge, a  refrigerating/heating water bath, a ductless fume hood, a an  ultrafreezer, an analytical balance, a pH meter, a hot plate, a  vortex mixer, a Wiley mill, and a set of micropipetters. These  instruments will be used principally in a research program  designed to quantify a number of related secondary compounds  (glycoalkaloids) in fruits of Solanum species and to isolate  these compounds for use in bioassays with birds, mammals,  microbes, and insects. Such studies are critical for  understanding the role of secondary compounds of ripe fleshy  fruits in mediating interactions among plants and the organisms  that consume their fruits. Of particular interest is the apparent  evolutionary paradox of \"toxic\" fruits and the relative effects  of fruit toxins on organisms with contrasting effects upon seed  viability and seed dispersal.          This research was initiated at the University of Florida  under NSF grant DEB-9207920 (Douglas J. Levey, PI) and is being  continued by the co-PI of this grant and the project director of  the current proposal, Dr. Martin L. Cipollini, with financial  support for materials and supplies from Berry College. Dr.  Cipollini began a tenure-track faculty position at Berry College  in August 1995. Because of a historical lack of academic research  instrumentation at this college and because of the necessity of  leaving research equipment at the University of Florida upon his  leaving, it has been very difficult for Dr. Cipollini to resume  the laboratory-based components of his research. Acquisition of  the above items will allow the resumption of this research and  will allow this research to expand i n other directions in the  future.          Of particular concern is the desire to involve  undergraduates in Dr. Cipollini's research program. Berry College  has a guaranteed student work program, which gives faculty  researchers virtually unlimited access to qualified undergraduate  research assistants, generally two or three students per  semester. With the instrumentation to conduct the research,  undergraduates will be able to be fully involved in all aspects  of this research program. Students will have the opportunity of  acting as research assistants, of being involved in directed  studies (independent research for credit), and of conducting  honors-level research. Moreover, use of a number of these pieces  of equipment will be shared with at least three other faculty  researchers at Berry College, Drs. Chris Mowry, Bill Davin, and  Laura Fielden, who share an unimproved lab (Cook 302) with Dr.  Cipollini. Availability of these instruments to these researchers  will likewise enhance their research programs and their ability  to support undergraduate research and education at Berry College.",
