The Workshop celebrating the  10th  anniversary of the discovery of HTS will be held on March 12  through 16, 1996, in Houston, Texas.  The present status  of  HTS  will be reviewed, and the future of the field  will  be  contemplated  so that the HTS science can be  unraveled  and  the  technology developed.
