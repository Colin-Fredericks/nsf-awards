This magnitude 8.3 event occurred at a depth of 636 km, was the largest earthquake in the world since 1977 and the largest deep earthquake ever recorded.  Data from this origin of deep seismicity and the structure of one of the  most seismically active areas in the world.  This grant will support the construction of an event data base for the mainshock and 42 of the largest aftershocks that will immediately be made available to the general scientific community through the on-line IRIS data center.  Funding will also augment an intensive research program in the analysis of these close-in station recordings.  This grant is supported under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research Program and also is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.",
