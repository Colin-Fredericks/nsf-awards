 "awd_abstract_narration": "9529376  Lambrecht  Many of the  condensed matter systems (and also devices made  from materials) with applications in the mesoscopic region,  have a layered geometry.  This proposal consists of a plan  to calculate the electronic structure of these systems using  a sophisticated, efficient algorithm.  The computational  effort, based on a difference equation in the layer indices,  within the framework of the density functional theory using  muffin-tin orbitals, scales with the number of layers (as  opposed to the number of atoms).  Following calculation of  the one electron Green function for a mesoscopic system with  atomic level precision, one can derive the self-consistent  charge density, total energy, optical excitation energies  and transport properties.   The calculations will be carried  out for group-III nitrides, SiC polytypes and rare earth  based  semimetal/semiconductor layered structures.  %%%  The popular man-made materials, in a variety of applications  such as solid state lasers and magnetic memory devices, have  a layered look.  There is need for a calculation of their  electronic properties.  The novel approach to be used is  particularly efficient and allows an atomic level  understanding of the complex processes underlying the  optical and magnetic properties of these systems.",
