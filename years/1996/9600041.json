 "awd_abstract_narration": "After an initial buildup in the number of firms, new industries  commonly experience a ~shakeout~ in which the number of firms  declines sharply.  Shakeouts reflect an abrupt change in market  structure, and thus explaining them promises to illuminate the  forces shaping market structure.  Following a long tradition of  theorizing about the connections between market structure and  technological change, recent theories featuring technological  change have been proposed to explain shakeouts.  This project  focuses on the development and test of a new theory of shakeouts  featuring technological change that has quite different  implications regarding firm survival than the competing theories.    A preliminary version of the new model is developed and its  distinctive implications concerning firm survival are derived.  These are contrasted with the firm survival implications of the  competing theories.  In order to test the alterative theories,  data are collected on the entry and exit dates of all the  producers of five products that were subject to considerable  innovation and experienced severe shakeouts: autos, tires,  televisions, typewriters, and penicillin.  In addition to  studying products that experienced severe shakeouts, two  technologically progressive products that have not yet  experienced shakeouts are analyzed: lasers and petrochemical  styrene.  Hypotheses are advanced for why these products have not  experienced shakeouts and a plan is laid out to test these  hypotheses using detailed data on entry and firm survival for  lasers and styrene.",
