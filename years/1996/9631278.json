 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Statistics at Stanford University will enhance its research and research training programs by developing the following, interconnected, aspects of its infrastructure:  A.  Graduate Student Support with Interdisciplinary Orientation.   Building on a base of faculty joint appointments in application areas and prior experience, Stanford will expand its training of interdisciplinary Ph.D.s.  by supporting four additional students. There is an extensive network of faculty contacts in relevant departments at Stanford, and support in the curricular structure for building competence in the application area while acquiring a thorough research training in statistics.  B.  Summer Mentoring programs for Women and Minority faculty and for Post-doctoral scholars.   The department will continue and expand a highly successful program to help launch the careers of pre-tenure women and minority faculty and post-doctoral scholars by involving them in the already active program of visitors, seminars and research at Stanford each summer.  C. Computer Infrastructure.  The department aims to provide a research computing environment for its faculty, students and visitors that enables maximum productivity. The department will acquire hardware and software on a staged basis in support of the core equipment already in place. Examples include X terminals to maximize student and visitor access to computing, and extra disk and memory to support increasingly memory intensive research, such as in statistical image processing.",
