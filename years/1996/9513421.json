A dual approach is being taken:  to study in  depth structure function relationships in sperm lysin, for  which two high resolution crystal structures, an expression  system and a quantitative biological assay are all  available; and to initiate and carry out structure  determinations of three additional sperm and egg proteins.  To understand key steps during fertilization it is necessary  to solve the crystal structures of the molecules involved.  The proteins under investigation are involved in critical  steps of fertilization.  The only crystal structures of a  fertilization protein available are of the monomer and dimer  of sperm lysin.  Recently, an expression system has been  developed which yields milligrams of very pure and  biologically active material.  An outstanding opportunity  now exists to understand the function of this fertilization  protein.  These crystallographic experiments will enable  cell biologists to visualize and understand fertilization at  the molecular level.    Four proteins are under investigation: 16K and 18K sperm  lysins, ADP-ribosyl cyclase and sperm protein 56 (sp56).  sp56 mediates specific sperm-egg interaction in the mouse.  Abalone sperm 16K lysin dissolves a hole in the egg  vitelline envelope (VE) permitting the sperm to penetrate  the VE.  Fusion of the sperm and egg cytoplasmic membranes  is promoted by 18K lysin.  Cyclase from Aplysia ovotestis  synthesizes cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) from NAD.  cADPR  regulates the release of intracellular Ca2+ and induction of  the cortical reaction, resulting in the formation of the  fertilization envelope.  A model has been developed for the  mechanism of VE dissolution by lysin.  It proposes specific  functions for the novel surface features of the protein both  in the monomeric state, as it binds to the VE, and in t he  dimeric state, as it exists in solution and within the  acrosomal granule.  All aspects of the hypothesis for the  mechanism of VE dissolution can be tested with site-directed  mutagenesis.  Mutant proteins will be assayed for biological  activity and their crystal structures solved.  These  experiments promise to define for the first time the  activity of a fertilization protein at the level of  individual amino acids.  Diffraction quality crystals have  been obtained of ADP-ribosyl cyclase.  Crystallographic  analysis of ADP-ribosyl  cyclase will provide the first  insight into cADPR-receptor interaction and provide a basis  for modeling the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. Crystals  have been obtained of green abalone 18K lysin, and  recombinant sp56 will be used for crystallization  experiments.  ***",
