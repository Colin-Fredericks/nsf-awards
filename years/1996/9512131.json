The investigators  propose  to compare the integral, YIX and Monte Carlo solutions for a  rectangular and axisymmetric geometry.  Nonhomogeneous  distributions are the key element of this study.  The  objective of this project is to develop benchmark solutions  of radiative heat transfer. This proposal requests funds to  enable a U.S. Ph.D. graduate student to spend one semester  at the National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan to work with  Professor C.Y. Wu and for the  P.I.'s travel.  Benchmark  solutions for this system are important in view of  increasing trend toward high temperature manufacturing,  materials processing and energy production.  There is a  strong need for computation solutions taking into account  the effects of radiation on the total transport phenomena.  This project can advance a computation method for estimating  radiative transfer and provide opportunities for a U.S.  graduate student  international experience to research and  study at a university in Taiwan for one semester.",
