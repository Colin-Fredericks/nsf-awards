 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622961  Huang    This grant supports the research of Professor Y. Huang to work on various problems in the theory of vertex operators and conformal field theory. He wishes to study higher-genus conformal field theories, especially their applications to geometry and topology. He also hopes to study geometric constructions related to Virasoro algebras, sigma models, and the geometry of the monster sporadic group.     This is research that starts out in the field of algebra but moves beyond that to touch both number theory and theoretical physics.  The reasons for these connections are that algebra can be though of as the study of symmetry in the abstract. As such algebra has direct applications to areas of physics and chemistry. In particular the modern theory of gauge fields in physics uses this area of algebra extensively and this project will study some of these connections at length. There are also connections to coding theory and the transmission of data across communication lines.",
