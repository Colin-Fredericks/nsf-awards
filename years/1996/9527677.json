 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program is supporting   Schatz's research program which is concerned with using computational   methods to determine the rates of chemical reactions that are important   in combustion and atmospheric chemistry.  For certain kinds of reactions,   the current generation of computers has opened up new opportunities for   the use of theory to determine rate information at a level that is better   than or competitive with experiment.  A goal of the research program is   therefore to develop theoretical methods (quantum and classical dynamics   methods) that take advantage of the new computer power to characterize   important reactions.  Another component of this work is the   representation of potential energy surfaces that determine the forces   between the atoms while reaction takes place.  Such surfaces have proven   difficult to describe when simultaneous bond-breaking and bond-forming   occurs, or when there are multiple reaction pathways.  However the Schatz   group has developed several techniques for representing these surfaces   and the resulting surfaces have been widely used.        The theoretical dynamics methods and reactive potential energy   surfaces will together be used to study several specific chemical   reactions of interest to the combustion and atmospheric kinetics   community for the purpose of interpreting and predicting experiments.   Planned studies are aimed at understanding the role of reagent   vibrational excitation on chemical reactivity, including the importance   of mode-specific chemistry; at characterizing reactions in which there is   a change in electronic state while the reaction occurs (with emphasis on   the influence of spin-orbit excitation on chemical reactivity); and in   understanding reactions in which there is no reaction path that connects   reagents and products.  Other topics include the use of theory to   understand the spectroscopy of transition states of chemical reactions,   and the characterization of collisional relaxation rates that leads to   the stabilization of reaction intermediates.",
