 "awd_abstract_narration": "Friedberg 9531957  This investigation will deal with four main directions of research. First,  the principal investigator proposes to continue his work, joint with D. Bump and J. Hoffstein, to obtain information about automorphic L-functions through the systematic study of certain naturally  occurring Dirichlet series in two complex variables. These L-functions are not themselves Euler  products, but their individual coefficients are Eulerian. These series arise  as integrals of Rankin-Selberg type, possessing meromorphic continuation and functional equation.  The integrals may be analyzed by local representation- theoretic methods, and the Dirichlet series coefficients related to  L-functions.  The properties of the integral are then used to obtain  properties of the L-functions. The principal investigator will  investigate integrals on certain orthogonal and symplectic groups and on  their metaplectic covers, which should give analytic information concerning  such objects as twists of GL(2) automorphic forms by cubic characters, mean  squares of twists by ideal class characters of quadratic extensions, and the  nonvanishing and mean size of quadratic twists of the standard L-function  associated to an automorphic representation on GL(3).The study of more  general sums of L-functions, involving more than two complex variables, is  also anticipated. Second, the principal investigator proposes to investigate  the Euler products associated with higher degree metaplectic automorphic  forms.  The existence of such Euler products is predicted by the hypothetical correspondence between metaplectic forms and non-metaplectic ones; however,  they have only been exhibited in a few cases.  There are two such Euler  products known on covers of GSp(4), one on the double cover due to the  principal investigator and Wong, and the second on the triple cover due to  the principal investigator's student T. Goetze.  The principal investigator  proposes to first give these works less computational foundations by   connecting them  to the theory of non-unique models presented by Rallis and  Piatetski-Shapiro, and then to use this new approach to generalize them to  covers of degree higher than 3, and to groups other than GSp(4). This work  will probably be joint with D. Bump. Third, the principal investigator will  continue to work on the relative trace formula. This formula, which combines  period considerations arising from integral expressions of $L$-functions with Langlands functoriality, should ultimately allow one to establish in many  cases that L-packets contain generic members.In a recently completed massive  project, the principal investigator and Jacquet have proved the fundamental  lemma for one such formula. Fourth, in recent work with D. Goldberg, the  principal investigator has begun to use certain models which are not  Whittaker models to deal directly with non-generic representations on  orthogonal and unitary groups.  It is proposed to use these models to  establish both local results (e.g. Langlands conjecture on Plancherel  measure) and the global continuation of many L-functions arising from  Eisenstein series a la Langlands-Shahidi, even for non-generic  representations of these groups.    This research falls into the general mathematical field of Number Theory.  Number theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers,  addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one  whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and  was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within  the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse  applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and  communication systems.",
