 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering education often focuses on disseminating technical information, without helping students make the  connections between this information and both their own life experiences and the processes they will encounter in  their careers. This results in a lack of true understanding, excitement and motivation for the subject matter. Students  from non-traditional backgrounds and with non-traditional learning styles are particularly affected. The goals of this  project are to integrate exposure to chemical engineering processes into the curriculum, motivate students to become  actively involved in their education and view the world from a chemical engineering perspective, satisfy the variety of  learning styles of chemical engineering students, and assess the effectiveness of multimedia approaches in achieving  the above goals.  Interactive multimedia software will be developed. The software will be divided into three  components: Technical Content Modules, Chemical Engineering Case Studies, and an Encyclopedia of Chemical  Engineering Equipment. These components can be used together or individually in introductory chemical engineering  classes as well as in freshman design courses. This software will integrate graphics, animations, full color still images  and moving video clips into a multimedia package that will allow students to learn the basic concepts in chemical  engineering through exploration of actual situations ranging in scope from simple bench-scale experiments and day to  day experiences to chemical manufacturing plants. The effectiveness of these materials will be tested, and the  software will be disseminated nationally through the use of CD-ROMs suitable for both Macintosh and Windows  computers, and through the World Wide Web. In addition, it is likely that Prentice-Hall will distribute these materials.   N.SF Form 1295 (11/93)",
