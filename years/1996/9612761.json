 "awd_abstract_narration": "961-2761  Cochran         This research project is part of the US Joint Global Ocean  Flux Study (JGOFS) Southern Ocean Program aimed at (1) a better  understanding of the fluxes of carbon, both organic and  inorganic, in the Southern Ocean, (2) identifying the physical,  ecological and biogeochemical factors and processes which  regulate the magnitude and variability of these fluxes, and (3)  placing these fluxes into the context of the contemporary global  carbon cycle.       This work is one of forty-four projects that are  collaborating in the Southern Ocean Experiment, a three-year  effort south of the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone to track the  flow of carbon through its organic and inorganic pathways from  the air-ocean interface through the entire water column into the  bottom sediment.   The experiment will make use of the RVIB  Nathaniel B. Palmer and the R/V Thompson on six process cruises  between  Oct.-Nov., 1996, and March 1998.       This component focuses on the spatial and temporal  variations in the distributions and particulate fluxes of thorium  isotopes (thorium-234 and thorium-228).  These isotopes serve as  ocean tracers that yield fundamental information about the rates  of biogeochemical processes that govern the production and fate  of biogenic particles in the oceanic water column.  Measurements  of thorium-234 will be made at sea by beta and gamma-counting;  measurements of thorium-228 will be made ashore by alpha-  spectrometry.  The data will be interpreted within the context of  biological rate measurements and other data to be collected  during the study and will be used to provide estimates of export  fluxes of organic matter, carbonate, and silica from the euphotic  zone; to quantify transformation processes such as aggregation  and disaggregation in the water column; and to test  biogeochemical models.       Thorium is a particularly useful tracer in this context  because its mode of production is well known; it is taken up  quickly by biogenic particles, and it s concentration can be  measured quite precisely.  The removal of thorium by falling  particles can therefore be determined, and the inverse problem of  inferring the integrated mass of falling particles (the  particulate carbon flux) may be solved.  ***    .",
