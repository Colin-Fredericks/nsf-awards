 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Timothy Hughbanks, Department of Chemistry, Texas A & M University,   is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program   of the Chemistry Division for an investigation of the solution chemistry   of polymers and clusters containing metal-metal bonds and of ionic   liquids as media for the crystallization of cluster based compounds.   Group 3, 4, and lanthanide clusters, which are known to exist in the   solid state, will be extracted into solution using an   imidizolium/aluminum trichloride mixture, which is liquid at room   temperature.  The solution medium will permit these clusters to be   characterized as molecular species and to be manipulated in a more   controlled, rational fashion than is possible with purely solid state   phases. The project  will initially concentrate on a series of zirconium   based systems and will develop these as precursors to extended clusters   and polymers. As the project progresses, a systematic investigation will   be carried out on the use of ionic liquids as solvents for the   preparation and crystallization of a variety of cluster compounds.  This project aims at devising a new method of preparing and manipulating   polymers composed of metal atoms. While such metal species are known to   exist in the solid state, the syntheses are not simple and it is often   impossible to use these cluster and polymeric substances as, for example,   starting materials for more complex polymers or clusters. A new 'ionic'   solvent system has been devised and this will be used to dissolve the   materials from the solid. By obtaining them in solution, it will be   possible to both characterize them and utilize them to reproducibly form   new, presently unknown materials.",
