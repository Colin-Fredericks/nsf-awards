This project is motivated by the need for effective performance  analysis, optimization, and design of such systems.  There are  two integrated major research thrust we propose to pursue:  (A) Characterization and investigation of mechanism of ordinal  comparison.  Recent research as demonstrated that ordinal  comparison, or comparing relative orders of performances of  different designs, converges very fast despite possible presence  of large estimation errors.  The indicator process turns out  surprisingly to be a fundamental concept with several important  implications.  Based on the notion of indicator processes, the  ordinal comparison converges exponentially fast in many important  situations.  The indicator process also provides useful insight  on the dynamical behavior of ordinal comparison.  In this  project, we shall further investigate dynamic properties of the  indicator process and its impact on optimization, design, and  simulation of discrete event dynamic systems.  (B) A new ordinal approach to optimization and design of discrete  event dynamic systems. Discrete event dynamic systems are  complex, stochastic, and nonlinear.  System design has to cope  with difficulties such as complex structure, slow convergence of  performance value estimates, and large discrete search space.  We  shall (i) investigate simulation planning for efficient  comparison; (ii) establish new optimization and control  algorithms utilizing the fast convergence of ordinal comparison.  These algorithms can allocate quickly good designs with minimal  budget.    Education Plan:  The PI has (a) opened a new course in manufacturing systems which  draws students from business school and local industry; (b)  introduced computer into classroom; (c) mentored students.  In  this project, the PI will:        (1) develop a software for his manufacturing systems course;       (2) further refine a computer program he has written for a       course on matrix algebra;       (3) establish a partnership with local industry in          undergraduate and graduate education.  ***",
