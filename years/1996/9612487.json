Under this Program, the National Science  Foundation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are jointly  evaluating and supporting research of high priority to the USWRP.           It is well known that the atmosphere is a chaotic system.  As a consequence,  small errors in the initial conditions of any numerical weather prediction model  amplify as the forecast evolves.  Because the atmospheric state can never be  measured exactly, initial conditions will always contain errors whose magnitude and  structure can only be estimated.  Hence an infinite spectrum of plausible initial  conditions exists, all of which are consistent with analysis uncertainty.          A procedure for defining the scope of forecasting uncertainty and improving  forecasts is known as ensemble forecasting (EF).  EF involves running multiple  forecasts starting at the same time, but from different, equally-likely initial  conditions.  The Principal Investigator will address four fundamental aspects of  short-range EF of quantitative precipitation forecasting (QPF) at the mesoscale:    Estimate limits of predictability for QPF by current operational forecast models;       Investigate minimum number of ensembles needed to robustly estimate forecast     evolution of probability density function of QPF;       For QPF forecasts, determine relative importance of model differences verses     uncertainties in initial conditions;        Determine the relative merit of using short range ensemble forecast at a lower     resolution verses a single, high resolution deterministic forecast.    The Principal Investigator will collaborate in this effort with scientists within the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  Successful completion of this  research could lead to substantial improvements in abili ty to forecast precipitation.  ***",
