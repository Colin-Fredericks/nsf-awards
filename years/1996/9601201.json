 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    PI:  ASHLEY  PROPOSAL NUMBER:  9601201    Mating and Parasitic Behavior of Brown-headed Cowbirds    The breeding biology of the brown-headed cowbird, Molothrus  ater, will be investigated through a comprehensive field and  laboratory study.  Both the mating system and the parasitism  practices of individual female cowbirds will be studied by  assigning parentage to 450-500 cowbird eggs and nestlings  collected at a field site at the Morton Arboretum in Lisle  Illinois from mapped nest locations.  This will be done by  DNA microsatellite genotyping, which allows parentage to be  determined by exclusion.  The genetic data will be used to  determine whether cowbirds at this study site mate  monogamously, as has been previously reported, or  promiscuously.  Brood parasites such as the brown-headed  cowbird are freed from parental care, which makes monogamy  theoretically improbable.  If it is determined that cowbirds  are indeed monogamous, prevailing theories of avian mating  systems may need to be reevaluated.  The genetic analysis  will also be used to test the hypothesis that female  cowbirds restrict egg-laying to definable areas that are  largely non-overlapping. Non-overlapping reproductive areas  would suggest competition for a limited resource, host  nests.  This will be done by mapping the locations of  offspring assigned to an individual female and comparing  these to distributions of other femalesU offspring.  Previous field work at this study site demonstrates that  cowbirds differentially parasitize the nests of certain host  species when multiple hosts are available.  Several  ecological factors including habitat, nest type, host size,  and host defenses are strongly correlated with observed  rates of parasitism.  The proposed study will examine the  extent to which these patterns reflect behavioral  adaptations (e.g. host choice) of female cowbirds.  Two  related field studies will be conducted to determine if  fem ales preferentially parasitize the highest quality host  species and/or avoid low quality host species such as those  known to eject cowbird eggs from their nests (RrejectorsS).  The first field study will determine the relative abilities  of different commonly parasitized host species to  successfully foster cowbird nestlings. The relative  qualities of different hosts as cowbird surrogates will be  compared to observed patterns of parasitism to determine if  high-quality host species are selectively parasitized.  The  second field study will determine parasitism rates of  RrejectorS species.  At our study site we have observed  parasitism of three species of hosts known to eject cowbird  eggs,  indicating that female cowbirds are not completely  avoiding these host species.  By experimentally parasitizing  the nests of these species, the rate of egg-ejection will be  determined.  From this measure and the observed rate of  parasitism, we can ascertain whether cowbirds prefer  acceptor host species over rejectors, or alternatively, fail  to discriminate against these  low-quality  hosts.  Demonstrating patterns of host choice is important both for  understanding host-parasite coevolution and for developing  conservation strategies to protect host species threatened  by cowbirds.",
