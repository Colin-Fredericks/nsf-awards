 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632059  Redner  Theoretical studies will be done on non-linear transport  processes and related collective properties in heterogeneous  media.  Two general topics will be considered, including the  dynamics of inelastic gases and filtration processes.  A  primary goal will be to develop new models and new  qualitative methods to account for basic phenomena.  The  steady response of an inelastic gas in small temperature and  concentration gradients will be used to help develop basic  insights into the transient cooling and underlying  clustering phenomenon.  Investigations will be done on basic  aspects of filtration in which small suspended particles in  a fluid are removed by passing the suspension through a  porous matrix.  These removed particles gradually plug the  porous medium giving rise to feedback between transport and  filtration efficiency.  New models will be developed to  describe this non-steady response analytically and to  understand the underlying percolation problem induced by the  plugging network.    Investigations will also be done to understand coarsening  processes and related kinetic phenomena in simple models of  competitive and adaptive behavior.  The \"vicious  civilization\" model appears to account for some aspects of  the time development and relative strengths of real  civilizations.  A transition between a \"fair\" and a  \"superpower-dominated\" world is identified and studies will  be made to quantify the essential phenomena associated with  this transition.  Similarly, studies of \"adaptive\" voter  models will be done.  In these models new types of  transition rate rules are introduced to mimic several basic  elements of human behavior.  The long-time properties of  these systems will be investigated with particular emphasis  on the statistics of opinion changes.  %%%  This research involves theoretical studies of statistical  models which describe transport phenomena, such as the flow  of liquids, through filters and th eevolution of spatial  organization, such as p attern formation in fluids.  The  results will be of wide interest to the mathematics,  statistical mechanics and materials and processing  communities.  ***",
