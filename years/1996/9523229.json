 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will analyze the evolutionary relationships of Otavipithecus namibiensis, the recently  discovered Miocene hominoid species from Namibia.  The Miocene hominoids, a diverse  assemblage of fossil apes which occupied the Old World from roughly 22 to 5 million years  before present, gave rise both to humans and our closest living relatives, the African apes.   Consequently, understanding the evolutionary relationships of these early apes is crucial to the  study of human origins.  This study also will address a specific methodological problem in  hominoid studies:  the role of quantitative morphological characters in the reconstruction of  hominoid evolutionary relationships.  Current methods of coding quantitative characters into discrete character states for cladistic  analysis and several statistically-based methods new to primate systematics will be applied to  morphometric data taken from hominoid mandibles.  The relative effectiveness of these methods  will be compared.  The study sample will comprise fossil and extant hominoid mandibles housed  in collections in the U.S., Europe, and Africa, with an emphasis on constructing valid biological  samples and maximizing sample sizes.  Evolutionary analysis will be performed using current  computer-assisted methods of phylogeny reconstruction, and previously stated hypotheses  concerning the evolutionary relationships of Otavipithecus namibiensis will be examined in the  light of these results.  In addition to being a detailed investigation of the evolutionary affinities of Otavipithecus, this  study will provide the first rigorous examination of the role of quantitative character coding in  primate phylogeny reconstruction, the results of which ultimately may be generalized to additional  anatomical regions in hominoids, as well as to studies of other primate groups.",
