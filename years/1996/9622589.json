 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program provides support for research on synthesis of   organonitrile-bridged transition metal compounds by Dr. Kim R. Dunbar of   the Chemistry Department, Michigan State University.  Chain, layered and   three-dimensional assemblies will be constructed and crystallized, and   their magnetic and conducting properties determined.   Acetonitrile   compounds undergo facile substitution reactions so that a variety of   ligands can be added to moderate properties.  Solubility for extended   arrays will be enhanced by varying charge on metal precursors, varying   substituents on organic groups, and varying outer sphere ions present in   extended networks.   Compounds will be of two main types.  One type of   compound will contain transition metals sigma-bonded to the nitrogen atom   lone pairs of polynitrile acceptors.  Species such as tetracyanoethylene   (TCNE) will be used.  In these systems, paramagnetic metal centers are   assembled into the organic radical network.  The second type of compound   consists of transition metal cyanide complexes reacted to form extended   arrays of ferro- or ferrimangnetically coupled chains or two-dimensional   networks.   In this research, synthesis of transition metal nitrile compounds will be   controlled so that pure crystals of one-, two-, or three-dimensional   arrays will be formed.  The arrays are expected to exhibit unusual   magnetic properties which will be able to be correlated with structural   arrangement.  By manipulating the organic groups attached to the metals,   the solubility of the compounds will be controlled in order to build   specific types of molecular arrangements and crystal growth.",
