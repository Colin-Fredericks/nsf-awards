 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project develops an interactive environment  which allows a user to perform analysis, and synthesis of  interacting multi-energy domain systems (such as mechanical,  electrical, magnetic, fluidic, thermal, and hybrid systems  which may consist of a combination of the above mentioned  domains). The approach used addresses the multi-energy  domain feature by using an energy method for the system  representation, which is based on energy  methods and the  bond graph representation of physical systems. All  information pertaining to mass balance, momentum balance and  energy balance are included in this representation. The  system's structural information is also preserved under this  representation. Useful information is  extracted from bond  graphs representation of physical system. The energy method  relates the properties and the constraints from all energy  domains in a unified approach. The main results of this  research include modeling theory of multi-energy domain  interacting systems and a generic software package for  modeling, analysis and synthesis of components, machines and  processes. The tools allow the user to rapidly set up a  simulation for analysis and performance evaluation. This  interactive environment has the capability of suggesting  design alternatives thereby assisting in the synthesis  process and allowing the user to have a system's point of  view. The final product will result in an important impact  on both industries and academia by enhancing their efficient  analysis and synthesis capability.",
