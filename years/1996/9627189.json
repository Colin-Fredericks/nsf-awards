 "awd_abstract_narration": "Strogatz  9627189       Many populations of biological oscillators can exhibit  remarkable collective behavior.  Despite differences in their  individual natural frequencies, the oscillators spontaneously  synchronize to a common frequency.  Examples include chorusing  crickets, fireflies that flash in unison, and synchronous firing  of cardiac pacemaker cells.  The investigator and his colleagues  study the principles underlying these self-synchronizing systems,  using analytical, computational, and experimental methods.  The  mathematical investigations concern the dynamics and stability of  mutual synchronization, analyzed with techniques from  perturbation theory, nonlinear dynamics, and statistical  mechanics.  The experimental aspects of the project deal with the  chorusing behavior of the snowy tree cricket, regarded as a model  experimental system for studying mutual synchronization.  The  experiments quantify psychophysical aspects of individual male  responses as they relate to chorusing, and then extend to the  behavior of larger groups, based on empirical measures of  auditory perception, physiology, and signal propagation.  The  goal is to understand mutual synchronization in this biological  system, and to test the results quantitatively against the  predictions of mathematical models.       This study provides the first detailed experimental  investigation of mutual synchronization in a biological system.  Although the synchronized chirping of crickets is the phenomenon  being studied, the goals of the project are much broader.  How  does synchrony emerge in a group of dissimilar oscillators?  This  issue arises throughout all of science and technology, in such  problems as the synchronization of arrays of lasers to achieve  greater collective power, or the synchronization of pacemaker  cells in the heart to produce a coherent beat.  Theories of such  self-synchronizing systems have been considered mathematically  for almost thirty years, but they have never been checked  experime ntally against any real biological system.  This study is  the first step in that direction.  Benefits are expected not only  for our understanding of biological synchronization, but also for  spin-offs to technological applications involving arrays of  oscillators, such as superconducting Josephson junctions and  lasers.",
