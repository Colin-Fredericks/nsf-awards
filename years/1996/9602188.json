 "awd_abstract_narration": "9602188  Reddi    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Lakshmi N. Reddi,  Department of Civil Engineering, Kansas State University, to make  a short-term visit to Korea to finalize plans with Dr. In-Mo Lee,  Department of Civil Engineering, Korea University, for  cooperative research to assess the impact of particle transport  on filter performance under realistic in-situ conditions.  During  the one-week visit, the collaborators expect to (1) gather field  information on which to develop the experimental basis of future  research, (2) observe the placement of filters and overall  construction procedures as an aid to understanding discrepancies  between field observations and laboratory results, (3) formulate  assumptions for the modeling component of the proposed research  project, and (4) prepare an outline of the modeling and  experimental components of the proposed research for review by  tunneling industry consultants and by KOSEF prior to submission  of a formal proposal to NSF and KOSEF.    A number of soil structures, both above ground and subsurface,  require filters for protection against erosion and piping.  Fine  particle accumulation in filters leads to buildup of pore  pressure which can be large enough to cause damage to such  structures as retaining walls, dams, and tunnels adjacent to the  clogged filters.  Field conditions in the subway system in Seoul,  Korea, offer an excellent opportunity to test the fundamental  particle transport models currently being developed by the PI.   The proposed collaborators have considerable experience in the  field of the proposed research.  This project is relevant to the  objectives of the U.S.-Korea Program which seeks to increase the  level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and  engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas,  skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of  mutual interest and benefit.  ***",
