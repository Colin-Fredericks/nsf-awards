The R/V ALPHA HELIX is a 133' general research vessel  owned by the National Science foundation and constructed in 1966.   The ship is scheduled for 174 operating days in 1996, of which 123  days are in support of NSF-sponsored projects.  The cruises will be  primarily in the north Pacific Ocean but include significant  research cruise legs to the Aleutian, Bering, and Chukchi Sea  regions during minimum ice conditions in late summer.    This vessel is part of a fleet used by NSF and other research  agencies to support oceanographic research.  Most oceanographic  research requires specialized equipment that must be permanently  installed on the research vessel.  Trained crew members are also  required to support the equipment systems and research operations.   This is the first year of a planned three year award.  ***",
