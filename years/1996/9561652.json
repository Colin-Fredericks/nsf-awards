 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on developing pH sensors that are thermally robust (stable over 100 +C) for geochemical and environmental applications. Existing pH sensors are of glass electrode design and are widely used for process control and research applications. Despite their simplicity, rapid and stable Nerstian reponse, the glass electrode pH sensors exhibit acid and alkali errors, sensitivity to monovalent cations, mechanical fragility, undesirable impedance, and instability at high temperatures (> 100 +C). These characteristics seriously impair the use of commercially available pH sensors in a wide range of applications, and geochemical and environmental applications in particular.  it is proposed to demonstrate a pH sensor based on nanostructured materials that overcomes these limitations and is economical.  Proof-of-concept of the sensori is expected to be established during Phase I, optimization and field testing of the sensor with lead customers during Phase II, and commercialization of the sensor to niche markets during Phase III.       The proposed pH sensor would assist earth and geological studies and enable efficient and reliable operation of caustic scrubbers for acid gases, detoxifiers of chromates, boilers in utility plants . The improved sensor would help explore geological reserves, conserve raw materials, improve the environment, and help produce safer and reliable products.",
