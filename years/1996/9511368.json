 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511368  Over the past decade, interest in historical syntax has grown  substantially among generative grammarians as it has become clear  that the study of successive stages in the historical development  of languages provides useful results to the field of comparative  grammar. Historical data adds two dimensions to investigations  into the specification of the parameters of universal grammar:  (1) the minimal character of the grammatical differences between  successive stages in a historical development allows for more  controlled comparison than do comparisons of unrelated languages;  (2) the sequential order and temporal coincidence of linguistic  changes allows hypotheses regarding the correlation of  superficially disparate features to a single abstract underlying  property to be tested by the way these features appear and  disappear in the historical record.    The nature of historical data (surviving texts) requires the use  of a methodology different from that of synchronic syntax if it  is to be exploited to its full potential. To this end, the  investigators have constructed three corpora, one of Middle  English, one of Yiddish, and a smaller one of Early New High  German. In the next period of research, they will double in size  the Middle English corpus, taking it from its current 510,000 to  1.1 million words. The need for this work is created by the wide  range of dialect variation in Middle English and the important  syntactic changes which take place in this period. Proper study  of this variability requires more and larger text samples than  the current corpus contains.    Prior work on the syntax of verb movement and verb complement  order in Middle English and Early Yiddish using moderate size  corpora and recent theoretical work in West Germanic has opened  up a number of avenues of inquiry which the planned research will  address:    1) the historical processes by which grammars change, including  the contribution of dialect and language contact;    2) the proper analysis  of V2 in Middle English, taking into  account dialect data, and the insightful but opposing theories of  Pintzuk (1991) and van Kemenade (1992);    3) the comparative grammar of the variation between head-initial  and head-final verb phrase structures;    4) the potential contribution to the analysis of historical  Germanic of recent proposals by Kayne (1993) and Zwart (1993)  regarding the proper grammatical treatment of variation in  directionality.",
