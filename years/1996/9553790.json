 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Oklahoma Teacher Education Collaborative (O-TEC), a consortium  composed of K-12 schools, two-year, and four-year institutions from  across the state, proposes a program that addresses concerns in the  teacher preparation system from recruitment, through pre-service  training, into early years of teaching.  A series of Summer  Academies, in which potential teachers work under the direction of  classroom teachers to present model lessons in science and  mathematics, will recruit talented youth and particularly focus on  underserved populations.  Entry points at two-year institutions of  higher education will be strengthened by development of appropriate  courses and formulation of a curriculum for para-teachers.      O-TEC institutions will revise their general education courses in  science and mathematics to meet the needs of pre-service teachers.   Engineering faculty will also participate in development of general  education offerings appropriate for teachers.  Instruction in  professional education will have a field orientation and use  cooperating teachers who are confident and accomplished in hands-on  methods.      To address retention and professional growth during early years of  teaching, O-TEC will train experienced teachers and building  administrators to provide support in science and mathematics  teaching through state entry-year committees.  A summer in-service  program will bring new teachers together after their first year to  share experiences and respond to concerns about content and  pedagogy.  O-TEC will sponsor sessions for entry-year teachers at  meetings of the Oklahoma science (OSTA) and mathematics (OCTM)  associations to encourage professional participation.  O-TEC  institutions will also provide consulting for entry-year teachers  who experience difficulty and will provide equipment load to new  teachers.  Use of technology will be a component of all activities,  and several modes of evaluation will provide feedback for guidance.",
