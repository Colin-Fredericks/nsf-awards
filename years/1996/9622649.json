 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622649    Jiles      Rapidly quenched metallic glasses such as Iron-Born-Silicon (Fe-B-Si) have found applications as soft magnetic core materials in electrical transformers and motors due to their intrinsic low energy losses under a wide spectrum of frequencies. Specifically, they exhibit low dc hysteresis loss and low classical loss (associated with low thermal conductivity). The current research aims to reduce the excess eddy current portion of the total core losses. The approach is to modify the magnetic domain structure on the surface by using laser scribing. Thermal modeling will be attempted  taking into account the rough surface and low thermal diffusivity of metallic glasses. The combined modeling and experimentation is likely to lead to a better understanding of laser interaction with metallic glasses. If the hypothesis to reduce eddy current losses by laser scribing is proven, it will be an attractive manufacturing process for the transformer core manufacturer who is actively participating in this research providing both monetary and  researcher's time.    Electric power conversion inefficiencies in transformers and motors is a major drain of energy running into billions of dollars. A major source of waste lies in the energy loss of magnetic cores in these devices. This research offers an innovative manufacturing process step which has the potential to reduce the energy loss in a new class of magnetic materials. The US manufacturers of electric transformers  and motors could gain a major competitive lead. In fact, one manufacturer has given substantial commitment. In addition this collaborative industry/university research is likely to facilitate, an exchange of ideas between academe and industry and enhance the educational process of students.",
