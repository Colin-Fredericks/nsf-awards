As such, Fisk is excellently situated to be instrumental in the national effort to increase the numbers of African-Americans and women in computer science.  The purpose of this project is to design a five-year plan for the development of the human and technological infrastructure necessary for Fisk to be a national model for the attraction and retention of female and African-American computer science students.    To attain this goal Bellin and Monroe of North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University recommend that three main program components be addressed: recruiting, mentoring and graduate study (Computing Research News, Jan. 95).  Instead of targeting isolated aspects of the student experience, a broad strategy that manages all stages of student progress from high school to professional career is proposed.  Recruitment is addressed by outreach and bridge programs, and expanded computer science specific recruitment efforts.  Retention strategies include scholarships and mentoring at all levels.  The establishment of a graduate degree program and under-graduate research programs is an integral part of the plan.  The enhanced infrastructure supports the expansion of faculty research programs which are the basis for student research activities.",
