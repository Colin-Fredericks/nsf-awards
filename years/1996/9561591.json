 "awd_abstract_narration": "9561591  Bartos     Corrosion inhibitors are widely used for the protection of metal surfaces against corrosion.  In some cases, their use is the only possible way to protect metals from an aggressive environment.  Corrosion inhibitors cover a wide spectrum of chemical substances including both inorganic and organic compounds.  In many cases, however, the highly efficient inhibitors are very toxic and, therefore, are a high risk to health and to the environment.  There is a great need for new, low cost, environmentally safe, high performance corrosion inhibitors to replace the existing no-longer satisfactory substances such as chromates.  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will examine a new class of naturally based corrosion inhibitors.  These materials have the potential to meet the need for a completely non-toxic, environmentally safe corrosion inhibitor.  In Phase I, research will be carried out to investigate critical issues related to the preparation and performance of the new inhibitor.   The proposed new corrosion inhibitor should be highly efficient, non-toxic, biodegradable and is prepared almost entirely from renewable natural resources.  Furthermore, the proposed technology is simple and the raw materials are low-cost.  These key features are of great commercial potential for all applications where metallic surfaces have to be protected against corrosion.",
