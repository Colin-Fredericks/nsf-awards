 "awd_abstract_narration": "9634813  Peshkin   Assistive devices aid in maneuvering subcomponents with safety and ergonomic benefit, thereby reducing worker strain and fatigue during assembly operations.   However, these devices usually reduce freedom of motion and dexterity.  This Grant Opportunity  for Academic Liaison with Industry cooperative research project between Northwestern University and General Motors will investigate programmable constraint machines as assistive devices for assembly, promising to retain dexterity and freedom of motion.  Programmable constraint machines use sensors and control methods to provide two modes of operation: a free or \"castering\" mode where essentially unconstrained motion is possible for moving subassemblies into position, and a constrained or \"wall\" mode where a software barrier or guide is used to move a subassembly into prescribed position. Programmed constraint devices do not servo an assembly into position, so they are essentially passive devices that rely on the human operator's dexterity and the use of these software guides to ease the assembly task.  This cooperative project will result in half scale prototype devices and full scale implementation at the General Motors Assembly Center.     This project will advance theoretical and applied research in the areas of robotics and assembly.  The potential impact of this research on improved worker safety will lead to productivity and cost benefits.",
