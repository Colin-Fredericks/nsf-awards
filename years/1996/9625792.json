 "awd_abstract_narration": "This projects focuses on development of scaleable parallel Molecular Dynamics (MD) code to study the behavior of diblock copolymers under shear.  Fast parallel algorithms have been developed for simple fluids and for short range MD, but algorithms that can handle polymeric chains are not available.  Besides, current algorithms only deal with equilibrium problems, whereas there is a need to study problems with added shear flow.  Several groups, have studied the equilibrium phase diagram of diblock copolymers by means of simulations.  Simulations have not as yet been used to study their experimentally observed, rather complex, dynamic response.  Symmetric diblocks in equilibrium make a transition from a low temperature, ordered (lamellar) phase to high temperature, disordered phase at the order-disorder transitions temperature (TODT).  Application of shear changes the value of TODT.  Ordered phases are observed even above the quiescent TODT.  The shift in TODT has been predicted theoretically for very long polymers. For short diblocks- on which experiments are underway in Kramer's group at Cornell-theoretical predictions is not exist and one has to rely on simulations instead.  This project will also study factors that influence the orientation of lamellae.  Experimentally, different orientations have been observed, but which mechanisms play a role in the choice of preferred direction is not, as yet, well understood.",
