 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625061  Duenyas   The research focus of this CAREER award is on new techniques, structural results, and approximations for dynamic production control in the presence of variability.  The research develops effective control mechanisms in three main areas:  batch processing machines, machines with significant setup times, and time-constrained (\"perishable\") processors.  The investigator will apply results from semi-Markov decision theory, closed queueing network analysis, and stochastic ordering to obtain structural results for small problems that guide the development of heuristic techniques for larger problems.  The teaching plan includes the development of a new course integrating manufacturing processes and planning that will be offered in conjunction with a federally-funded educational coalition whose mission is the development of manufacturing expertise in a disadvantaged, inner-city population.   Production control problems addressed in this research are particularly relevant in the manufacture of semiconductor devices and flat-panel displays,  both critical industries for U.S. military and economic competitiveness.  The investigator will work closely with manufacturers in both industries, including a developer of commercial factory planning/scheduling software for the flat-panel display industry.  This research has the potential to increase both yield and throughput in these manufacturing facilities.",
