 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Charles Trombold will conduct one season of archaeological fieldwork at the site of La Quemada which is located in the Zacatecas region of Mexico. La Quemada represents one of the northernmost manifestations of mesoamerican culture and dates between ca. 500 and 800 AD. The site itself  - also termed the `citadel` -  is a massively fortified civic/ceremonial center that occupies about 1.5 square kilometers on a mountaintop. Its intermediate hinterland covers at least 200 square kilometers of surrounding territory and contains an aggregated pattern of over 226 individual satellite settlements with associated terracing systems and fortifications. Many of these features are linked to the citadel by a network of wide causeways. The citadel and its satellite settlements appear to represent a unique island of sedentary mesoamerican high culture. Dr. Trombold will work not at the citadel itself but at one of the associated settlements ca. .3 km. distant. The site, MV-263 includes a series of sunken plazas with house mounds associated with each. Dr. Trombold and his team will clear large areas to expose plazas and associated domestic structures. Through analysis of ceramics and other cultural materials he will reconstruct the social, political and economic organization of the site and determine the extent to which production activities are centrally organized. On this basis it is possible to determine the degree of political centralization.  La Quemada is interesting because it is clearly associated with mesoamerican culture but is spatially separated from the great central Mexican cultures and sites. It therefore lies on an extreme periphery and provides an excellent situation in which to study periphery-core interactions. Archaeologists wish to look beyond individual sites and cultures. They try to place such units within larger social contexts and look at patterns on an interregional scale. Some have argued that cultural development in core and peripheral areas vary directly with each other. That peripheral areas are dependent on the cultural core and that when one thrives, the other does as well. Other researchers posit an inverse relationship. They believe that the core dominates and holds peripheral peoples down and only when the core is weak do peripheral societies flourish. Much is known about the core, which in this case lies in Central Mexico and periods of core strength and weakness are well delineated. Much less is understood about peripheral areas such as La Quemada and through the examination of changes here in social organization over time, the interaction can be examined in detail.  This research is important for several reasons. It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists. It will also increase our understanding of how regional interaction occurs in simple level societies.",
