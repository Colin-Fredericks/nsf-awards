 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This award supports a collaborative research project between Dr. Awatef A. Hamed and Dr. Widen Tabakoff, both professors at the Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at the University of Cincinnati, with Dr. Reda Mankbadi, Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Cairo University in Egypt.  The research deals with the particle dynamics and jet noise of gas-particle flows in supersonic nozzles.  The U.S. team will conduct experimental studies and develop models for simulating the particle dynamics and their interactions with the high Reynolds number flow through the convergent-divergent nozzle.  The Egyptian scientist will develop the techniques for calculating the noise from the ensuing supersonic particle-flow jet.  Scope:  This project involves collaboration of a U.S. experimental fluid mechanics team with an Egyptian expert in computational fluid dynamics and acoustics research.  The complementarity in this cooperative research is expected to be beneficial to the two sides and should lead to a better research output.  Both teams have, independently, done extensive work in the field, with very strong records of publications.  This project is to have them combine their skills, competence, and facilities to advance the knowledge in an area of great importance in aerospace engineering, and in environmental engineering in various industries.  The beneficiaries in advances in this field include, in part, designers and manufacturers of aircraft engines, ground-based gas turbines and other propulsion and power plant systems.  This award is being funded jointly by the Division of International Programs and the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems.",
