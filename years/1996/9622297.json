 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622297  Simmons  The general objective of the proposed research is to  identify activity in the brain that causes perceptual images  to have their particular content.  The specific question is  how specific numerical values for parameters of neural  responses manifest themselves in corresponding numerical  values for perceptual dimensions of images.  This project  uses target ranging in the biological sonar of the big brown  bat, Eptesicus fuscus, as a \"test-bed\" for addressing  questions about the formation and content of perceived  images.  Sonar and radar systems offer an especially well-  developed body of theory about signal-processing and display  of information that can be used to understand the mechanisms  of biological systems evolved for the same purpose.  Moreover, the exceptional real-time performance of biosonar  systems in well-defined tasks of target localization,  tracking, and classification make it obvious that there are  technological advantages to understanding how echolocating  animals achieve this performance.  The starting point for  the project is that bats have unusually good echo-delay  accuracy of 10-15 ns and \"two-point\" echo-delay resolution  of s.  The initial problem is to account for this seemingly  implausible performance with neural responses, which from  physiological single-cell recording experiments appear to be  2-3 orders of magnitude less precise.  New physiological  experiments in the bat's midbrain and auditory cortex reveal  that the \"missing\" high-precision temporal information is  carried by the latencies of multi-cell neural responses  using expanded time scales.    There are two prominent competing hypotheses about neural  substrates of perception which differ in the relative  importance of response-rate and response-timing for  determining image content.  These hypotheses yield widely-  divergent predictions from neural data for what bats should  be able to perceive about target range.  The combination of  behavioral and physiological data from Ep tesicus leads to  rejection of the hypothesis that relies exclusively on  response-rate to represent information in images, while  sustaining the hypothesis that response-timing may be \"read  out\" directly into perception.  The proposed research will  examine these competing hypotheses in more detail because  rejection of the response-rate model has widespread  implications for neuroscience and for bioengineering,  specifically for development of man-made systems that seek  to emulate animal sonar performance.  The proposed  experiments will use 3-D video reconstructions of the bat's  flight in sonar-guided interceptions to quantify how well  the bat can locate and recognize targets in complex multiple-  target sonar \"scenes.\"  New psychophysical experiments using  electronically-simulated targets will measure the structure  of the bat's sonar images to determine whether specific  combinations of single and multiple overlapping echoes  delivered from different directions lead to predicted echo-  delay values appearing in the images.  New physiological  experiments will record and analyze the response in the  bat's inferior colliculus that carry fine echo-delay  information on expanded time scales to learn how these  responses are combined to form images.  A large-scale  computational model of the bat's sonar will be used to  evaluate experimental data in the context of emulating the  bat's performance.  ***",
