 "awd_abstract_narration": "9602246  This award provides additional support for a BIO Research  Training Group in the Analysis of Biological Diversification  first established in 1991.  During this course of this  second award, NSF support will be phased out as other  sources of funding are secured.  The 24 member faculty group  is drawn from 6 departments and 2 divisions at the  University of Arizona.  The funds awarded will provide  stipends for undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral  trainees, purchase computational equipment, and to bring  investigators from other research and academic institutions  to the campus for seminars.  University resources will  augment the funds provided by NSF in most of these and in  other categories.  Molecular, developmental, and population biologists, as well  as systematists, ecologists and paleontologists, have  developed distinctive approaches to the study of biological  diversity.  Owing to the way in which students have been  trained traditionally, the connections among these  approaches have not been explored in detail.  While their  individual research interests are as diverse as the list  above, the faculty have formed this group with the aim of  using phylogeny, which can be viewed as the history of  diversification, as an approach to the integration of these  disparate perspectives.  ***",
