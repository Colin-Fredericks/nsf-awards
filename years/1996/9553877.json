 "awd_abstract_narration": "9553877  Thier    THis is a four year grant to the Science Education for Public  Understanding Program (SEPUP) to develop, field test, and publish  a life science curriculum for middle school science.  The SEPUP  design is an issue-oriented activity-based curriculum that is  developed by science educators and scientists with continuous input  from classroom teachers and their students.  The curriculum is  based on major life science concepts as they apply to real-life  decision making by the individuals and along with the SEPUP  physical science curriculum, Issues Evidence and You, forms two  years of middle school integrated science.    The proposed curriculum has three major content areas, My Body and  Me-including reproduction and development and maintenance of the  human body; Living Partnerships-including evolution and ecosystems;  and Using Tools and Ideas - the ways which humans use tools and  ideas to adapt the external environment.  Four process-oriented  components, Scientific thinking, Personal and Societal Decision  Making, Science and Technology as Professions, and Futures Study,  is integrated throughout the curriculum.  The curriculum includes  embedded assessment that allows teachers to measure the growth and  development of students.",
