 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630775  Krishna  The proposed research will focus on the structures and  dynamics of long chain neurotoxins isolated from the  New World scorpion Centruroides sculpturatus Ewing, and  the Old World species Leiurus quinquestriatus  quinquestriatus. Specifically, several neurotoxic  proteins from both species will be purified and  sequenced.  The proteins that will be characterized will  include both the long chain - and neurotoxins.  Standard  2D-NMR methods as well as NOESY-TOCSY will be employed to  extract experimental constraints needed for structure  refinement calculations.  Protein breathing motions will  be probed by measuring amide proton exchange life times.  The order parameters and correlation times will be  measured from 13C relaxation time measurement at natural  abundance using a double DEPT sequence.  The differences  in the structures and dynamical behavior within each  class, and between the two classes of proteins will be  examined.  A number of hypotheses on the structure-  function relationships among this class of proteins will  be tested.  %%%  Neurotoxins serve as excellent probes of ion channels  Despite a high degree of sequence homology, the scorpion  neuroxtoxins can differ dramatically in their toxicities  and the nature of interactions with the ion channels.  The proposed studies will be important in understanding  the intriguing differences exhibited by the - and -  toxins.  This work will significantly enhance fundamental  knowledge on the molecular mechanism of interactions  between the neurotoxic proteins and the sodium channel.  ***",
