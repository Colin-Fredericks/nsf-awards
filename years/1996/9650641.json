 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem addressed by this project is the lack of student access to modern, dependable equipment that is primarily dedicated to undergraduate teaching of laboratory courses in Animal Nutrition and Animal Reproduction and Development. Objectives are to develop laboratory curricula that give students training in the application of biological principles to solve problems in animal agriculture through an understanding of the scientific method and to provide significant individual access to items of equipment that enable students to test hypotheses and gain technical experience with modern experimental procedures.   The plan includes the expansion of the laboratory classes in the two disciplines to include a substantial class experiment on the nutritional physiology of growing lambs (Animal Nutrition) and an array of individual or small-group projects on gamete and embryo physiology (Animal Reproduction and Development). Both experiences include significant student participation in developing hypotheses and setting specific objectives; reports are written in scientific format. The target audience is predominantly sophomore and junior undergraduates majoring in Animal Science.   The significance and impact of this project for undergraduate education are related to the number of students whose exposure to experimental animal science may be substantially increased. All of the 470 students, plus a moderate number of nonmajors, take at least one of the courses described. Evaluation of the success of these innovations is conducted by student and faculty peer review, and results may be communicated to scientific peers at annual meetings of the American Society of Animal Science and the Society for the Study of Reproduction, each of which has sessions devoted to undergraduate instruction.",
