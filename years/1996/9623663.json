Local field enhancements, in turn, result  in  the  enhancement  of  both  linear  and nonlinear  optical  processes.  Doping   the   aggregates   into  microcavities   (e.g.,   liquid  microdroplets)  further  increases the local  fields  because  of  trapping  by  mirocavity resonant modes. Nanoparticle-microcavity  composites   are   expected  to  possess  unique  characteristics  including   extremely   large  linear   and   nonlinear   optical  susceptibilities and strong dependence of the fractal  eigenmodes  on  the  frequency and polarization of the exciting laser and  on  the  structure  of the microcavity resonances. Investigations  of  nanocomposite materials will provide insight into the  effect  of  morphology on spectral properties. The composites themselves have  potential  applications  to  photonics,  information  technology,  signal  processing,  aerosol science, and  remote  sensing.  This  project will carry out experimental and theoretical studies of  a  variety  of optical effects including linear and nonlinear  Raman  scattering,   fluorescence  and  lasing,  and  other  third-order  processes  including  degenerate four-wave  mixing;  other,  more  fundamental,  studies  will  include  Anderson  localization  and  cavity quantum electrodynamics.  %%%    Aggregates of small particles are widely found in nature and  may  also be fabricated in the laboratory. In the process of formation  many  of these aggregates form frothy structures that possess  so  called \"scale invariance\", that is, they have the same appearance  when  viewed  over  a  wide range of sizes. Such  aggregates  are  examples  of \"fractals\" and include commonly occurring, materials  such as smokes, foams, polymers, and DNA. A second constituent of  the  composite is exempli fied by the simple raindrop (that is,  a  small,  spherical liquid droplet). The composite material itself,  consisting  of  liquid  droplets  containing  fractal   aggregate  inclusions, may form naturally or may be the result of a specific  laboratory  procedure.  A  number  of  recent  experimental   and  theoretical  studies  suggests  that  these  composite  materials  possess unusual optical properties, resulting from the fact  that  each   constituent   (i.e.,  the  fractal   aggregate   and   the  microdroplet)   possess  so-called  electromagnetic   resonances.  Electromagnetic  resonances  are  responsible  for  many  unusual  optical phenomena and generally lead to an amplification  of  the  light   emitted  by  the  resonant  system.  General  theoretical  arguments  suggest  that the composite materials  should  exhibit  enhanced   resonance   behavior,   they   have   many   potential  applications  to  such diverse fields as information  technology,  signal  processing, and atmospheric monitoring. In this  project,  the   PIs  will  carry  out  both  experimental  and  theoretical  investigations of these novel composite materials.  ***",
