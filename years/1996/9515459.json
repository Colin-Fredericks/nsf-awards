 "awd_abstract_narration": "9515459  Holomuzki      This award will support the travel of Dr. Joseph Holomuzki  of the Division of Natural Sciences, Transylvania University in  Lexington, Kentucky, to enable him to conduct collaborative  research with Barry Biggs from the Freshwater Division of the  National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWAR),  located in Christchurch, New Zealand.  The goal of this research  is to document the role of native and non-native fishes as  community organizers in New Zealand streams.  Specifically the  work seeks to determine whether native and non-native fishes  differ in their abilities to withstand scouring floods and to  examine the effects of these fishes on post-flood recovery  patterns of stream communities.    Interest in how biotic (trophic interactions) and abiotic  (flooding) forces interrelate to organize communities is  of current importance in studies of stream ecology.  The  effect of introduced trout on New Zealand stream communities is  little known.  The American investigator brings to the study his  expertise in biotic dynamics and interactions; the New Zealand   researcher has extensive background in abiotic factors.  This  study brings together the complementary skills of the  collaborating scientists.  The research in New Zealand is  supported through the Ministry of Research, Science and  Technology.",
