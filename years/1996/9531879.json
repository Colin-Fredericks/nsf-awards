 "awd_abstract_narration": "9531879      Owens      In conjunction with a companion project by Dr. Russ Davis of the   Scripps Institution of Oceanography, 150 profiling ALACE   (Autonomous Lagrangian And Circulation Explorer) floats will   measure the absolute velocity and evolution of the temperature   and salinity structure of the upper 1500 m in the subpolar gyre   as part of the Atlantic Circulation and Climate Experiment   (ACCE).  Absolute velocities will be mapped at nominal depths of   400 and 1500 meters' depth using float arrays deployed uniformly   over the basin.  The velocity data will address three major   pathways of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) within   the subpolar gyre: the shallow inflow of water into the regions   of water mass modification; the convection that forms new dense   waters; and the outflow of the resultant intermediate water from   this source region.  Temperature and salinity profiling will   describe time evolution of the upper 1500 m, allowing   quantification of the rates of water-mass modification in the   warm-water limb of the MOC that supplies water for formation of   deep and intermediate water.  With 150 profiles observed roughly   every ten days over two years, these observations will describe   evolution with a combined temporal and spatial resolution greater   than can be provided by all the other ACCE observations,   especially over the winter-time convection season when other   observations are extremely scarce.      Analysis of these data will provide time series of three-   dimensional maps of the velocity, temperature, and salinity   fields within the upper 1500 m of the subpolar gyre over the   duration of the ACCE field experiment.  Additionally, statistical   analyses will provide spatial distributions of mean circulation   and quantities like eddy kinetic and potential energies, eddy   mixing, and fluxes of heat and freshwater. These gyre-wide   estimates will provide strong   constraints for the future climate models that must be developed   to adequa tely   include the physics of the subpolar gyre, particularly   convection.  The absolute velocity measurements will also be used   to reference large-scale geostrophic shears obtained from   hydrography in this region where strong   barotropic components are common.",
