 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves two components.  The first component is an extension of  prior work under NSF grant MIP-9412500 on the development of algorithms for  automatic generation of retinal vasculature maps, and real-time feature-based  determination of retinal position from intra-ocular digital video image  sequences.  Specifically, a TMS320C80 video signal processor chip will be used  to achieve fully transparent image tracking by reducing the time required to  establish a tracking lock to a small number of video frame intervals.  The second  component to this research is to modify the fundus imaging system acquired under  the previous award to achieve simultaneous imaging in the near infrared and  visible bands using a pair of low-light video cameras.  This instrumentation will  be used to investigate real-time algorithms for artificially superimposing  computed vasculature landmarks on late-phase Indocyanine Green angiograms.    This research will result in the development of real-time image processing  hardware and software technology for enabling the development of novel  instrumentation for laser retinal surgery and related applications.  It is  motivated by the need to reduce the currently high failure rate (approaching 50%)  of current procedures.  This project is an application of high-performance  computing technology to enable new advances in ophthalmology and related problems  in biology and medicine.  In addition to reducing the failure rate, this  technology is expected to reduce the cost of laser retinal surgery by eliminating  the need for repeated corrective procedures.",
