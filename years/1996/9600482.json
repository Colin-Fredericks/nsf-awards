This proposal requests  funds to convene a U.S.-Taiwan symposium on innovations in  undergraduate education in chemistry.  This symposium will  be modeled after the U.S. Gordon Conferences; eight U.S.  educators and seven Taiwan educators will present lectures.  Twenty college chemistry  educators and students from the  U.S. will be invited to attend.    Innovation in undergraduate education in chemistry is an  important topic in the development of  human resources in  science and international research infrastructures.    This  topic is particularly opportune, since chemistry education  in Taiwan has been undergoing a major change.  The Ministry  of Education has spent a billion dollars remodeling the  chemistry laboratories at 20 universities during the last  ten years.  The experience gained from this renovation will  be useful to share with chemistry educators in the U.S. The  meeting will be held at the University of California at San  Diego on December 15-18, 1996 and is jointly supported by  the Taiwan National Science Council and the NSF.",
