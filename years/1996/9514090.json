 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research collaboration between Dr. Gerald Edwards (Washington State University)and Dr. Boris Ivanon (Russian Academy of Sciences).  During photosynthesis solar energy absorbed by chloroplasts is converted into assimilatory power (ATP and NADPH) via electron transport, membrane energization, and phosphorylation with reductive power provided by oxidation of water and production of oxygen.  Debate is ensuing over whether two other forms of photochemistry, pseudocyclic and/or cyclic electron flow, have a role in photosynthesis in plants.  Pseudocylic electron flow occurs via oxidation of water with a linear flow of electrons culminating with oxygen, rather than NADP, as the final electron acceptor.  Cyclic electron flow occurs without oxidation of water and generation of oxygen.  The objectives of this project are to establish whether one or both of these forms of photochemistry function in mesophyll chloroplasts of the maize under conditions which place varying demands on the requirement for ATP.  Whether the supply of ascorbate in the chloroplasts regulates the capacity for pseudocyclic electron flow will be investigated.  Methods of analysis will include measurements of membrane energization, quantum yields of photochemistry and conversions of metabolites in the carbon metabolism using mesophyll chloroplasts isolated from maize.  This research will contribute to our understanding of the efficiency of the solar energy conversion by photosynthesis, which is crucial to sustaining life on earth.",
