 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has become obvious, in recent years, that a successful undergraduate mathematics curriculum cannot ignore the relationship between mathematics and real-world technology and that a successful curriculum demands the active participation of students in the discovery of ideas. This project provides for the creation of a mathematics laboratory classroom where students can utilize Macintosh computers as tools for active investigation in the calculus sequence and in introductory statistics.    The new mathematics laboratory promotes active learning through classroom interaction with software tools, provides the opportunity to explore real-world examples previously inaccessible without technology, shifts the pedagogical emphasis from computational methods to deeper conceptual understanding, emphasizes the links between these subjects and others in the natural and social sciences, and addresses national concerns about the cogency of traditional mathematics instruction.    The department is currently employing, testing, and developing supplemental materials for the Project CALC Mathematica laboratories developed at Duke University and Bowdoin College. They are developing and implementing statistics laboratories using Data Desk and the materials developed for the NSF Activities-Based Statistics project. These materials can be evaluated relative to the current materials using student and faculty surveys. Through this project, the department can strengthen relationships with high schools in the surrounding rural counties and provide AP teachers with much needed computer training through summer workshops. Other dissemination plans include presentations and publications and the use of R-MC listserver CRACAS.",
