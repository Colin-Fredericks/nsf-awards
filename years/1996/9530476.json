 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program supports research by Dr. Jacqueline K. Barton of the Department   of Chemistry, California Institute of Technology, for the construction of   metal-peptide complexes targeted to double helical DNA.  Oligopeptides   will be synthesized and coupled onto metallointercalators which have high   binding affinity for the major groove of DNA.  These intercalators will   position the appended peptide to bind specifically to other DNA sites.    The oligopeptides-- which are derived from the recognition elements of   DNA binding proteins such as phage 434 and P(22) repressors and the zinc   finger domains of Sp1 and ADR1--as well as the rhodium-containing   intercalators will govern the recognition characteristics. The   intercalator, peptide, and the linkage between the two will be varied to   target specific DNA sites.   Cleavage of the DNA strand by   photoactivation of the metallointercalator followed by chemical   footprinting will be used to determine binding locations.  The long term   goal of the project is the development of an array of small metal-peptide   complexes which bind DNA with predicatable sequence-specificities.    Additionally, by incorporating a coordination site for a secondary metal   ion into the appended peptide, zinc ion and metal-peptide-dependent   hydrolytic cleavage of the DNA phosphodiester backbone will be explored.  This research will contribute to understanding the principles of   recognition of nucleic acids by proteins, as well as develop some   vehicles to effect selective interaction of proteins with nucleic acids.    The results will be relevant to the design of therapeutic agents and   advanced clinical testing.",
