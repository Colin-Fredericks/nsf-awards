 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hugo A. Hopenhayn  University of Rochester  SBR-9514717    This research will examine several aspects of unemployment  insurance that have implications for the design of social  insurance in many other countries.  The P.I. will undertake joint  research with Dr. Antonio Cabrales of Spain and Dr. Juan Pablo  Nicolini of Argentina to understand the international dimension  of his research project.  The first aspect investigated will be  the adverse impact of unemployment insurance on the reemployment  of workers.  Unemployment insurance can induce workers to reduce  their search intensity or to decline some job offers.  The  research will attempt to determine the optimal design of  unemployment insurance to provide insurance yet still provide  suitable incentives for reemployment.  The second aspect will be  the ability to learn about different workers abilities over their  work history.  Unemployment insurance will transfer income from  high to low ability workers over time.  This will have an impact  on the optimal design of unemployment insurance.  The final  aspect of the research will look at the job creation and job  destruction process to learn if this too should affect the  optimal design of unemployment insurance, and if so, in what way.",
