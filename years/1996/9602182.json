 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This award supports collaboration between Dr. Khalil Najafi, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan (UM), Ann Arbor, with Dr. Tayfun Akin, Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at the Middle East Technical University (METU), in Ankara, Turkey.   The research project has two parts: 1. the design and fabrication of a low-power high-precision interface circuit for capacitive pressure sensors, and 2. the development and testing of a wireless capacitive pressure sensor with a telemetrically accessible output signal.  Part of the design and analysis of the sensors and the necessary electronics will be done at METU, while the fabrication will be done primarily at the UM.  The testing and characterization of these devices will be done at both institutions.   These micromachined sensors and actuators and other microelectromehanical systems (MEMS) have many applications in biomechanics and in implantable devices, in industrial processing, automotive systems, avionics, and in  environmental monitoring.   Scope:   This award allows collaboration between a very active and well recognized group in the United States, at the UM, and a small, but promising, group in Turkey at METU.  The collaboration will be beneficial to the U.S. team because of the recent work by the Turkish scientist and his expertise in designing analog circuits and the necessary interface circuits.  The Turkish scientist and his student will benefit from their access to modern fabrication facilities at the UM.  The resulting enhancement of capabilities at METU will be useful in meeting research needs in the rapidly growing MEMS field.  This award is funded jointly by the Division of International Programs and the Division of Electrical and communications Systems.",
