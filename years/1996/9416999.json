 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Snodgrass      The  Principal  Investigator  and his  students  will  carry  out  research  to  explore the relationship of the  Sun's  large-scale  patterns  of  surface  motion and magnetic  field  to  the  solar  activity   cycle.     They   will  analyze   solar   magnetograph  observations  taken  at  the 46-meter Tower  Telescope  at  Mount  Wilson  Observatory  and  also analyze  the  Carrington  maps  of  Hydrogen-alpha  neutral lines and coronal holes compiled  by  the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.   Both data sets  span  a  time period covering most (1967-76) of cycle 20, all  of  cycles 21 and 22 (1976-86 and 1986-96, respectively) and will, by  the end of the funding period, include the beginning of cycle 23.    The  investigation  will  include  projects  to  study   (1)  the  meridional  motions  of  both  the  field  structures   and   the  atmospheric gases, (2) the torsional oscillations,  both  in  the  rotation of the  photosphere and in the rotation of the magnetic fields, (3) the  relationship  between  sizes  of  magnetic  features  and   their  differential   rotation   profiles,  (4)   the   correlation   of  magnetograms  with neutral-line and coronal hole  maps,  (5)  the  association between the large-scale field and the loci of  active  regions  early  in the cycle, (6) the Sun's magnetic  dipole  and  quadrupole  moments,  determined by  least-squares  fits  to  the  magnetograph  data,   (7) the rotation of the  dipole  moment  as  compared with the rotation rates of coexisting coronal holes, and  (8)  the  association between polar field reversals and the  time  evolution of the large-scale field.    The results of the research will provide answers to questions  regarding  the role in the Solar cycle played by the  large-scale  background field, the nature of coronal holes, and the  mechanism  behind  the  torsional  oscillations.   In  addition,  they  will  provide  boundary  conditions for both the internal  motions  and  fields  i nferred through helioseismology and for the  theoretical  studies  of the Sun's internal dynamics.  The results  will  also  provide reasons for more detailed, but shorter term, measurements  made  at  other observatories and from space.  All data reduction  and  computer  analyses  will be carried  out  at  the  computing  facilities at Lewis and Clark College.",
