The project will train professionals who provide  services to students with disabilities about effective resources  and teaching/assessment strategies.  Participants will be exposed  to effective instructional practice through model hands-on,  multi-modality science lessons, which will include the use of  adaptive materials and suggestions for accommodating students  with disabilities.  The disability areas addressed will include  motor/orthopedic impairments, deaf and hard of hearing, visual  impairments, learning disabilities, cognitive impairments, and  behavioral disabilities.  The project will use a \"training the  trainers\" approach.  It will begin with the development of  training materials:  an in-service training module consisting of  a publication entitled Guidelines for Teaching Students With  Disabilities, print materials and video tapes related to  providing services to students with disabilities in the regular  science classroom, and hands-on science investigations that will  allow trainers to demonstrate five proven methods of delivering  science instruction with accommodations to students with  disabilities.  These materials will be tested and disseminated  through two routes: 1. Training of science educators and content  specialists in higher education.  The mode of delivery will be  pre-conference programs presented at NSTA and AETS (1997-1998),  Annual Meetings.  Participants in the sessions will be required  to prepare an action plan and deliver a program for faculty and  staf f at their institution of employment.  2. Training of science  teacher/special education teacher teams in a geographical region  where access to specialists is limited.  Collaboration of science  teachers and special educators as active teams will strengthen  the base of expertise and services to students with disabilities  in science education.  Participants in these sessions will be  required to prepare an action plan and will deliver a program for  teachers at their teaching location.",
