 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    Experimental Analysis of Alternative Male Strategies    PI:  SINERVO, Barry  IBN 96-31757    Three color polymorphism s of males are correlated with  distinct behavioral strategies in the side-blotched lizard,  Uta stansburiana:  (1) orange-throated males are very  aggressive and defend large territories with many females,  (2) blue-throated males tend to be monogamous and guard  their mates, but defend small territories, and (3) yellow-  throated males do not defend territories, but are sneakers  and mimic the behaviors of females if challenged by other  males.  Long-term field studies indicate that the three male  types are cycling in frequency within the population.  Orange is replaced by yellow, yellow males are, in turn,  vulnerable to blue mate-guarding males,  and blue males are,  in turn, vulnerable to ultra-dominant orange-throated males.  It is predicted that each morph has a fitness advantage when  it occurs at a very low frequency.  Because throat color is  heritable, the initial morph frequency will be manipulated  in small isolated subpopulations. When offspring mature, DNA  paternity analysis will be used to determine the  reproductive success of each  male offspring in the three  experimental frequency manipulations.  In a final  experiment, blood testosterone concentrations will be  manipulated to determine if the high testosterone levels  that have been observed in orange males is also responsible  for both their success against blue males, and their  susceptibility to the yellow male strategy.",
