 "awd_abstract_narration": "9624636  Kipke  Cochlear implants are small wires inserted in the inner ear that  can restore limited hearing to some profoundly deaf people.  However, our understanding of the neurological mechanisms by  which such implants work is far from complete.  While we know  that auditory areas of the cerebral cortex in adults continually  change in response to the sounds that are listened to and to the  onset of partial deafness, comparatively little is known about  how these parts of the brain respond to long-term use of cochlear  implants by hearing-impaired persons.  Yet, this adaptation (or  plasticity) of the cerebral cortex most likely plays a critical  role in determining the ultimate effectiveness of the implants,  and could provide a key to unlocking the world of sound for more  hearing-disabled people.    This project involves novel experiments and the development of  new computer models to investigate the dynamics (extent and rate)  of plasticity in auditory-related areas of the cerebral cortex in  response to long-term electrical stimulation using cochlear  implants.  Array of hair-sized wire electrodes are implanted into  the cerebral cortex of deafened animals that have been fitted  with a cochlear implant.  These electrodes allow monitoring of  local neurological responses as the animals learn to \"listen\" via  their cochlear implant.  These responses are correlated with  behavioral performance to gain insight into the brain's responses  elicited by the implants and their functional significance.  Concurrently developed computer models of the relevant brain  areas and of the cochlear implant provide important analytical  and visualization tools for understanding the complex mechanisms  involved in cerebral cortex plasticity driven by the implants.    This research is complemented by an education plan in which a  graduate-level student internship is developed with a leading  cochlear implant company.  This internship extends beyond the  conventional walls of academia by providing an opport unity for  bioengineering students to gain substantive experience in a high-  tech industrial setting.  It is a mechanism for training students  in science and engineering to contribute to advances in the U.S.  medical device industry.    This project provides critical new insight into how the brain  adapts to long-term use of cochlear implants.  A better  understanding of cerebral cortex plasticity may lead to important  new advances in cochlear implant design and patient training  procedures.  The project also provides important new  opportunities for attracting talented bioengineering students who  are interested in neural prostheses.  Together these activities  will ultimately, help increasingly larger numbers of hearing-  impaired people regain the ability to enjoy the sounds of the  world.  ***",
