The primary emphasis of the collaboration will be on determining  potential mechanisms that regulate the effect of elevated carbon  dioxide and nitrogen on leaf carbon balance, including those  involving photosynthetic enzymes and mitochondrial biogenesis.     The cooperative research will study these mechanisms at a field  site in California on Ponderosa pine, the most widely distributed  conifer in North America, and in New Zealand on Monterey pine, the  most extensively planted and economically important tree in that  country.  The American investigators bring to the study expertise  in physiology and biochemistry, while access to the trees and an  elevated carbon dioxide open-top chamber facility available in  Christchurch, contributes to this collaborative study.  Funding in  New Zealand is provided through the Ministry of Research, Science  and Technology.",
