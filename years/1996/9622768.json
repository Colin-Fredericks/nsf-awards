 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to investigate a new technique  for finding the implicit equation of a rational surface.  Standard implicitization techniques for rational surfaces are  based on resultants.  But resultants vanish in the presence of  base points.  Therefore, when base points are present, the  implicit equation can be recovered using resultants only by  carefully perturbing the parametric equations to eliminate the  base points.  But such perturbations generally introduce  extraneous factors, which then need to be painstakingly removed.  Thus base points seriously complicate implicitization using  resultants.  On the other hand, base points simplify the implicit  equation of a rational surface by lowering its degree.    Preliminary work has roughed out a new implicitization technique  based on algebraic \"moving surfaces\" that \"follow\" a rational  surface.  Not only is this new implicitization technique  impervious to base points, it also simplifies in the presence of  base points.  Moreover this new method generates a more compact  matrix representation for the implicit equation than methods  based on resultants.  Currently this new method is substantiated  only by several Mathematica examples and some preliminary  theorems.  It is proposed to develop the theoretical foundations  of the new method and then to apply the method to solve a variety  of practical problems in computer graphics, geometric modeling,  and symbolic computation.    A wide variety of additional problems in elimination theory might  also be attacked by these new techniques including, but not  limited to, inverting a rational map, computing the singular  locus of a rational surface, intersecting rational curves and  surfaces, and intersecting algebraic curves and surfaces.  ***",
