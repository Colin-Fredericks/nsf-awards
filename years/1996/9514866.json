 "awd_abstract_narration": "The political process by which economic policy is made and  implemented involves several principal-agent relationships.  One  participant (a political party, legislature, or a bureaucratic  agency) takes some action that affects another (voters, special,  or interest groups).  The latter (the principal) can devise a  contract or an incentive scheme to influence the actions of the  former (the agent).  The incentives take different forms.  In the  relationship between lobbyists and political parties, these can  be cash payments.  When groups of voters are the principals and  politicians the agents, the incentives take the form of promises  of votes.  When the Congress is a principal for a bureaucratic  regulatory agency, the incentives can consist of funding or  threats of micromanagement.    Observers of political agency relationships have noted an  important special feature of these, namely the existence of  multiple principals who simultaneously attempt to affect the  actions of the agent.  In the U.S., each bureaucracy is  constantly under pressure from the Congress, the courts, the  media, and lobbyists.  In Europe, several sovereign nations  attempt to influence the decisions of the European Union's  central decision-makers.  In such common agencies, the incentive  schemes offered by the various principals jointly affect the  action of the agent, and therefore the return to each principal.  The equilibrium of this interaction among the principals  ultimately determines the agent's incentives.    The aim of this project is to construct theoretical models to  examine the interaction in several such \"common agencies,\" and  characterize their outcomes.  A general methodology is developed,  which can help construct tractable models involving several  principals and several dimensions of the agent's choice.  The  value of the approach is demonstrated using two solved examples,  and then several further proposed applications constitute the   research agenda.",
