Considering  the success over the last decade of new  colliders at Fermilab, SLAC, CERN, DESY, and  that others are due to begin operation this  year, collider physics will continue to grow as  an important branch of  High Energy Physics.   The Standard Model of particle physics is  generally believed to be incomplete.  The  investigators will explore phenomenological  implications of Physics Beyond the Standard  Model for current and future experiments at  high energy colliders.  Examples include the  search for supersymmetry, for Higgs bosons the  only Standard Model particle yet to be  discovered, as well as the physics of neutrinos  whose masses could provide clues to physics at  high energy.  Professors Sandip Pakvasa and  Xerxes Tata of the University of Hawaii at  Manoa, Honolulu will collaborate with  physicist, Dr. Rohini Godbole of the University  of Bombay and the Tata Institute of Fundamental  Research (TIFR).  All coinvestigators have been  actively engaged in phenomenological research  for the last several years.  This collaboration  will allow Godbole to interact with the large  experimental group at the University of Hawaii  that is involved with experiments at Fermilab  in the US, in China and in Japan. Scope:  High  energy physics is an area of research that has  been identified as a thrust area by the Indian  Government and is one of tremendous activity  and strength among Indian physicists. The   research team has particular expertise in the  areas of investigation and they have worked  effectively in the past. The modest support  requested for this project will allow the  investigators to renew their collaboration and  also strengthen cooperative research betweens  the growing community of collider physicists in  India and their counterparts in the US.     ***",
