 "awd_abstract_narration": "9561410  Dai         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project concerns the chemical modification of hard carbon coatings through reaction with radical species in order to improve their tribological performance.  These modifications can also lead to the realization of wear resistant solid lubricant coatings.  Two complementary approaches will be examined in parallel, fluorination and nitridation.  Fluorination of hard carbon surfaces can reduce their friction, while reaction of hard carbon with active nitrogen species may produce nitrogen-containing carbon films with excellent thermal stability and hardness.  This Phase I project will investigate pathways to improving the tribological properties (friction, striction and wear) of hard carbon coatings through chemical   modifications of the surface region. The goal is to define the mechanisms of fluorination and nitridation using novel sources and to establish quantitatively the relationship between the surface chemical composition, surface morphology and the tribological properties.  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy will be used in conjunction with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to characterize the modified films' chemical composition, surface structure, morphology and their tribological performances (friction,   striction).  In addition, a wear rester will be used to characterize the wear resistance of the modified films.       This project is designed for the development of solid lubricant coatings in the areas of precision tooling, magnetic recording, space technology, etc.  A major market that would be affected would be magnetic disk media.  As recording density increases, the distance (fly height) between the read/write head and the disk has to be decreased; full contact operation is under consideration.  As a result, the tribological properties of the hard carbon overcoats directly affect the dualibility of the disk and the read/write head.",
