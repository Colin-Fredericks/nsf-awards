The biochemical interactions and enzymatic kinetics of  highly purified proteins that have been altered either chemically  or by site-directed mutagenesis will be studied to understand their  mechanism of action.  Also, the concentrations of proteins before  and after a nutritional or physiological change will be quantified  to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms that regulate their levels  within an organism.  The titles of the research projects are   \"Regulation of Apolipoprotein A-1 Concentrations in Rabbit High  Density Lipoproteins by Dietary Cholesterol and Jojoba Oil\",  \"Synthesis and Analysis of Transition Metal Modified Peptides and  Proteins\", \"Mapping the Allosteric Activator Site of  Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylase by Site-Directed Mutagenesis\", and  \"The Role of Enzymatic Oxidative Defenses in Arabidopsis Leaf  Senescence\".    The program will involve five to ten students from minority groups  underrepresented in the sciences, specifically, African Americans,  Hispanics, and Native  Americans, with the objective of preparing  them for graduate school and research careers in biochemistry.   Activities will include research training and presentations at  scientific meetings, as well as seminars, and academic and career  counseling.  ***",
