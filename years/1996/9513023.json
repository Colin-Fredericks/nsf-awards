 "awd_abstract_narration": "A multi-user group proposes to purchase a phosphorimager for the  rapid, sensitive, and accurate detection and quantitation of  radioactive and chemiluminescent species in analyses of the molecular  genetics of signal transduction, DNA replication, and gene expression.  Specific projects include analysis of the mechanism by which DNA  replication is initiated in eukaryotic cells and how this process is  regulated; the mechanism of activation of Ras proteins by receptor  tyrosine kinases and the identification of downstream targets of  activated Ras proteins; the dissection of protein-protein interactions  that regulate transcription of genes in eukaryotic cells by RNA  polymerase II; testing models for the structure of large RNA molecules  and determination of the ways in which RNA structure can influence gene  expression, and exploration of signal transduction pathways involved in  cell growth and development. Specific applications that will utilize  the phosphorimager include in vivo radiolabelling of proteins;  determination of protein half-life; analysis of protein  posttranslational modificatimns, subcellular localization and  oligomeric states; analysis of protein-protein, protein-nucleic acid,  and intranucleic acid interactions; analysis of transcriptional control  elements; analysis of in vivo and in vitro DNA replication products.  The results of these studies will significantly extend our  understanding of basic cellular processes.",
