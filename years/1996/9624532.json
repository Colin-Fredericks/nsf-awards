 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on the preparation of beta-lactones by the   development of Lewis acid mediated (2+2) cycloaddition chemistry and   tandem aldol/lactonization methodology.  New transformations of   beta-lactones including intramolecular allylsilane additions  and ferric   chloride mediated tandem debenzylation/transacylation will be probed.     The educational plan focuses on the development of a `transition` course   for first year graduate students, including minorities, minority outreach   to local high schools  and development of multimedia presentations for   use in the teaching of organic chemistry.  With this CAREER award, the   Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research and educational   activities of Dr. Daniel Romo of the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&M   University.  Professor Romo will focus his research effort on the   asymmetric synthesis of a class of compounds known as beta-lactones.    These compounds serve as useful intermediates in organic synthesis, are   utilized as polymerization substrates and the basic structural unit   appears in a variety of physiologically active natural products.  The   educational plan will focus on the development of a `transition` course   for educationally disadvantaged first year graduate students and the   development of multimedia presentations related to organic chemistry",
