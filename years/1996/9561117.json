 "awd_abstract_narration": "95-61117  Johnson         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will focus on the  development of analytic techniques for the integration of density functionals.  In recent years, Density Functional Theory (DFT) has emerged as an accurate  alternative first-principles approach to quantum mechanical molecular  investigations, which is cost-effective compared with conventional correlated  methods. Unfortunately, the approximate density functionals used in practice  are quite complicated and numerical quadrature must be used for their  integration. There are difficulties inherent to such grid-based methods which  do not arise in methods where all the requisite integrals are evaluated  analytically, for example, as in Hartree-Fock theory. Unless great care is  taken in the handling of the molecular grid, undesirable effects manifest  themselves in the calculation. These various difficulties can be rigorously  handled, but their improper treatment is a source of problems in most  implementations.       The goal of the Phase I feasibility study is to develop an analytically  integrable density functional which yields a theoretical model chemistry  similar to that of the Dirac functional. We will implement the resulting  functional within the firm s quantum chemistry computer program.       A practical analytic method would eliminate the spurious effects  described above and at the same time would be quite likely to improve the  computation time for small and medium-sized systems. The commercial benefits  are apparent by measuring the substantial increase in both the quality of the  results and the efficiency of the system resulting in increased research  productivity and cost effectiveness.",
