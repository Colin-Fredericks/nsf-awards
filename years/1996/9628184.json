 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data management is critical to the functioning of wide-area wireless  communication networks.  The communication infrastructure maintains  user  profiles to keep track of information for operations such as call setup and  delivery, subscriber authentication, and billing.  Data management deals  with the problem of efficiently managing the information in user profiles,  which may be distributed across the network.  In evaluating different data  management schemes, performance measures of interest are:  1) profile  lookup and update response times; 2) individual and global database access  requirements: 3) individual communication link and global signaling  bandwidth requirements; 4) total memory requirement; and 5)overall system  cost.    Information in user profiles can be classified into \"system information\",  such as current locations of subscribers and subscriber authorization  information, \"service provider information\", such as billing records, and  \"feature support information\", such as numbers for call screening or call  blocking.  These different categories of information have different demands  on their data management schemes.    One of the primary objectives of our proposed research is to investigate  and develop novel database architectures and protocols for efficiently  managing all the classes of information in user profiles.  Specific schemes  will be designed to meet the various data management requirements.  We are  especially interested in developing schemes that, unlike current schemes,  provide lifelong user numbers through the support of location independent  numbering.   Scalability and backward compatibility to existing standards,  IS-41 and GSM, are also important design issues.  We have conceived a  promising architecture that is based on a hierarchical organization of  databases.  Its performance will be compared with a representative set of  other data management schemes through extensive simulation studies using a  realistic software simulator that we are developing.     Another major objective of our proposal is to develop a realistic and  extensible simulation platform for studying the performance of data  management schemes.  Realistic user call and movement models are crucial to  our performance evaluations.  We will develop detailed call and movement  models and corroborate them using actual traffic data.  We have laid the  foundation in this area through the development of the first version of a  highly configurable software simulator, Pleiades.   Our research in user  behavior models for our simulations is expected to have applications in  other areas of wireless communication research.",
