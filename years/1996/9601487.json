 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for the acquisition of equipment to support two  facilities using image analysis; an image analysis core facility and a  three-dimensional reconstruction facility. These facilities will be  housed in separate spaces on the third and fourth floors in a new  80,000 square foot networked Biology Building.        The image analysis core facility will be able to acquire  macroscopic and microscopic images. Equipment for this facility include  a camera stand, stereo microscope, CCD camera, framegrabber and Pentium  computer with Image Pro Plus software, video monitor, and vibration  isolation table for a new Olympus BH40 epifluorescent microscope. A  portable x-ray machine (housed in a research lab) will be used to  produce x-ray images of bone sizes and angles and egg size and number  in living reptiles. Radiographs measurements will be taken and analyzed  with the image analysis system. Data will be stored on Iomega 100 MB  zip drives. A separate Pentium computer with Image Pro Plus and Zip  drive will be housed in a computer lab to allow analysis of archived  images.        This facility will support research programs of several Biology  faculty across several disciplines. Roger Anderson and Herb Brown will  be using this facility for individual and collaborative projects to  examine skeletal elements and ecological performance in reptiles from  the wild. Giselle Muller Parker and Emily Peele will use image analysis  to count and size autofluorescent algae and fluorescently-stained  bacteria. June Ross will use the image analysis to measure  morphological features of fossil bryozoans.        The three-dimensional reconstruction facility will be used for  the optical sectioning of fluorescently-stained embryos, the removal of  out-of-focus fluorescence, the reconstruction of three-dimensional  structures, and the analysis of three-dimensional data. Equipment  include a vibration isolation table for a Leica DMRB rnicroscope, a  high resolution 40X oil objective, CellScan System  for  three-dimensional reconstructions, Pentium computer, Tektronics  printer, and a lGBJaz drive for data storage.        This facility will support research programs of two Biology  faculty. David Leaf will use the three-dimensional facility for  immunofluorescent localization of a rab GTPbinding protein in sea  urchin embryos. Mary Anne Pultz will use the facility for  immunofluorescent stainings of Nasonia wild type and mutant embryos  with cross-reactive antibodies against Drosophila developmental  regulatory proteins. Both projects are supported by NIH-AREA grants.  This facility will also support a collaborative project of Mary Anne  Pultz and David Leaf to analyze gene expression of the Nasonia  homologue of Caudal by in situ hybridization and immunofluorescent  staining. Finally, the facility will be used to start a long-term  project on producing a comparative three-dimensional atlas of gene  expression in Drosophila and Nasonia.",
