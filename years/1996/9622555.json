 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622555  Reitich    This project deals with analytical and computational issues in  electromagnetic   and acoustic scattering problems. It relates to a new method for  the  solution of such problems, based on high-order boundary  perturbation  and analytic continuation techniques, that was introduced by the  principal investigator in the context of diffraction gratings.  There,  the numerical algorithms produced, in many cases, results with  substantially improved accuracy over that given by classical  approaches.  The proposed research concerns new applications of the method in  other  challenging areas of current interest in electromagnetics and  acoustics and the further study and improvement of the numerical  properties of the resulting algorithms. Both the forward and  inverse   scattering problems will be investigated for a variety of  configurations, including scattering by electrically large  bounded  bodies and in ocean waveguides. In particular, the benchmark  problems  of electromagnetic scattering by three-dimensional cubes and of  sound   propagation in oceans with rough surfaces will be treated. Based  on  some preliminary studies, it is expected that the performance of  the  method in these areas will be of a quality comparable   to the one it exhibited in prior implementations.  %%%    The ability to predict the shape of the electromagnetic or  acoustic  field scattered as an incident wave encounters an obstacle or  interface has been long recognized as having major implications  in a  great number of scientific and engineering disciplines. Indeed,  much of  what we \"see\" --be it through visible light or x-rays,   radio or microwaves-- or \"hear\" reaches us through a complicated  combination of phenomena among which scattering is, in most  cases, an   essential element. As such, a better understanding of how light  and  sound waves propagate and diffract has led, in the last few  decades,  to substantial advances in a variety of fields; these include  communications, monitoring, s eismic profiling, tomography and  target   detection, to name just but a few. An important role in these  advances  was the one played by mathematical modeling and, with the advent  of   computers, that of computational science. The present and future  needs, however, demand the development of more efficient,  accurate and  reliable algorithms to deal with complex geometries and media.  Indeed,  the resolution of the scattering in such situations (such as when  dealing with human tissue or undersea topography) often entails  calculating a highly oscillatory field. When using most classical  algorithms these oscillations translate into high computational  costs,  as these methods attempt to capture the variations of the field  at  each point in time and space. Therefore, alternative approaches  whose   complexity does not correlate to that of the field under study  become  very desirable. The present project relates to one such approach,  that  was successfully developed by the principal investigator in the  context of micro-optical devices. The proposed research concerns  new   applications of this novel method in other challenging areas of  current interest in electromagnetics and acoustics where it is  expected to provide a valuable computational tool.  ***",
