 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past century the United States, Britain, and Germany have taken different approaches to  the development of public telecommunications and have built different telecommunications  systems and capabilities.  To account for such differences in trajectory and outcome, this project  will examine how material, economic, cultural and social conditions have shaped the meaning of  telecommunications technologies.  In contrast to purely cultural studies of technology, this work  will look closely at the technological artifacts in their contexts, through comparative case studies  of components.  It will also analyze the strategies employed by innovators to incorporate  different groups of users into public telecommunications networks and will compare such  strategies across nations.  Finally, by examining the history of telecommunications to the present  the study will provide insight into the gains and losses society might expect from future changes.",
