 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to provide a modern  transmission electron microscope facility for the Biological  Sciences Department of Ohio University. This facility also serves  as the Transmission Electron Microscopy Resource for the  University. The requested microscope will supplement the current  1 6-year-old, student-grade electron microscope currently being  used for both teaching and research in this department of 65  faculty and 80 graduate students. The upgraded facility will  continue to provide training for graduate students and  undergraduates with special aptitude for biology and research. It  will also be used for ultrastructural research. All of these  activities have been carried out for the past 25 years; they have  been supported by two transmission electron microscopes in the  past, but the older one was decommissioned last year, and the  remaining microscope is old and was never meant for analytical  research use.       Research that will be done with this facility include  several studies on muscle, such as _ examining the changes in the  nucleocytoplasmic relationship of skeletal muscle with aging or '  with changes in activity, detecting how skeletal muscle damage  occurs in the muscle fiber, or exploring the effects of dietary  trace elements on cardiac ultrastructure. Besides these muscle  studies, neurobiological research will include structural and  computational studies of mechanoreceptors in the inner ear, and  the structural mechanisms underlying the vestibular control of  head movements. Another project will use a combination of time  lapse and electron microscopy to study how the retina trophically  affects development of the optic tectum of the brain. The  mechanism by which mosquitoes become infected and transmit  arboviruses will also be investigated. Ultrastructural studies  will also be done on morphological adaptations evolved in  Antarctic fishes to reduce their buoyant density, and how feeding  upon toxic microorganisms has affected the digestive s tructure  and function of marine copepods.       Most of the projects listed above are currently supported by  NSF funding and use a combination of methods; all of them include  electron microscopy. The presence of a modern transmission  electron microscope is vital to these projects. Acquisition of a  new electron microscope will further enhance research in the  department because of the opportunity to attract more graduate  students and technicians to learn electron microscopy. It will  also allow graduate students to use a greater diversity of  research tools. The general effect of having a modern electron  microscope will be to enhance the training capabilities, the  research productivity and the level of grant support to this  department.",
