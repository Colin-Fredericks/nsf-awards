As a result,  choosing a single model may not lead to satisfactory predictions and may  significantly underestimate prediction intervals due to not  incorporating uncertainty about the model choice into the final answer.  Model uncertainty often outweighs other sources of uncertainty in  problems, but is often ignored. Bayesian methods offer a very  effective and conceptually appealing alternative: predictions and  inferences can be based on a set of models rather than a single model;  each model contributes proportionally to the support it receives from  the observed data. This research involves Bayesian methods for  stochastically searching high dimensional model spaces.  As the number  of models is very large, the challenge is therefore that of finding  efficient ways of exploring the space of models, selecting plausible  ones, and attributing to each of them a weight (approximating the  posterior probability) for the mixing-based prediction or other utility  calculations.  Examples for the methodology include  applications in wavelets and generalized additive models: calibration  and prediction in spectroscopy using wavelet packets; determining the  influence of particulate matter on mortality adjusting for other  covariates in the presence of model uncertainty; and variable selection  and prediction in binary regression models for seedling survival.  Model  averaging using importance sampling to sample from high dimensional  model spaces is an effective solution.  This approach is extended to  selecting transformations of variables, subspace selection and  thresholding in wavelets, and generalized additive models in the  applications described above.  Methods for sampling models with a  probability proportional to their expected utility are also developed.  %%%  Finding and using models to describe data is a fundamental problem in  both statis tics and the sciences.  Statistical predictions may be very  sensitive to the set of explanatory variables included in a model.  Selecting a particular model based on selecting a subset of the  explanatory variables and using this model for prediction, may lead to  riskier decisions due to not incorporating uncertainty about model  choice into the final answer.  Model uncertainty often outweighs other  sources of uncertainty in problems, but is usually ignored.  In this  research, predictions and inferences can be based on a set of models  rather than a single model; each model contributes to the decision  proportionally to the support it receives from the observed data. As the  number of possible models is very large, the challenge is therefore that  of finding efficient ways of exploring the space of models, selecting  plausible ones, and attributing to each of them a weight for the  weighted prediction or other decisions. The methodological developments  are driven by the following applications: calibration and prediction in  spectroscopy; and determining the influence of particulate matter on  mortality adjusting for other meteorological variables when there is  uncertainty about which variables should be included in the prediction  model.  ***",
