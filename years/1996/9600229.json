Project funding will  enable Dr. Han to spend three months in Japan, resident at  Gifu University, in order to study the structure disorder  parameter in semiconductor fullerene films.  Dr. Han has  previously studied the structure disorder in non-crystalline  semiconductors.  Dr. Nitta has been investigating the  optical absorption of semiconductor fullerene film.  Dr. Han  will combine her expertise with that of Dr. Nitta to study  the correlation between structure disorder and conducting  properties in semiconducting fullerence.    This proposal brings together research scientists from two  countries working in the area of fullerence.  Fullerence and  related materials have attracted great interest in recent  years because of their unusual properties and potential  applications.  The U.S. scientist will have the opportunity  to become familiar with fullerene film preparation, research  techniques, and facilities at Gifu University while  contributing to the overall research effort.  Therefore,  this proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its  exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an  international collaboration.  ***",
