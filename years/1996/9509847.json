Esteban Calzetta, Juan Pablo Paz, and  Diego Mazzitelli of the University of Buenos Aires in  quantum statistical field theory in gravitation and  cosmology.  Themes to be investigated include decoherence  and quantum-to-classical transition; galaxy formation in  inflationary cosmology; phase transition in the early  universe, and general relativity as an effective theory.    The experienced collaborators have probed the laws of nature  and the structure of space-time at the Planck scale,  obtaining results on early universe and black hole  processes.   The concepts and techniques of non-equilibrium  statistical mechanics and the formalisms of quantum  stochastic field theory established in their joint work are  to be further developed and applied to problems on  relativity and cosmology under this grant. The team,  including advanced graduate  students, will collaborate  closely in the generation and pursuit of new ideas and  problems within the themes described.  ***",
