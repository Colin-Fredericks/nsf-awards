 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist from the University of Michigan.  The student will study the structure and function of female-headed households in a rural area of Yunnan, China.  The hypothesis is that the status and ability of women to exercise independent authority will correlate with rising income levels. Using household budgets, participant observation, formal surveys of 100 randomly selected households, and semi-structured interviews with a sub-sample of 60 households, the student will describe and analyze the role of women in governing household budgets in areas with heavy male labor out-migration.  This project is important because it will advance our understanding of gender relations in China and the role of economic development in affecting these relations.  In addition it will increase our expertise about this important region of the world by further training this young scientist.",
