 "awd_abstract_narration": "Efficient storage organization and access is of central  importance to the advent of large scale multimedia systems.  Multimedia  applications, ranging from video-on-demand (VOD) to  medical tele-presense or large scale scientific computations,  involve storage and retrieval of large volumes of information  subject to a spectrum of real-time constraints.  Current  storage systems are inadequate to address the needs of multimedia  systems.  Indeed, various recent experiments in delivering VOD to  populations of several thousand customers have established  storage access as a key barrier to success.  There is thus a  growing need for a new generation of high-performance storage  technologies that can efficiently support large scale multimedia  systems.    The main goal of the proposed research is to develop novel  architectures and resource management algorithms for multimedia  storage systems that will result in orders of magnitude  performance improvements.  The main thesis pursued here is that a  storage system can exploit intrinsic, non-random, access  characteristics of multimedia applications to accomplish  dramatic performance improvements.  This research  effort will  have several important contributions to the study of multimedia  systems in general and to their storage technologies in  particular.  It will seek to characterize storage access patterns  of the broad spectrum of multimedia applications and study  techniques to take advantage of these characteristics in  improving storage and access efficiency.  The proposed study will  consider the entire storage hierarchy, study the entire pool of  resources and how these resources interact, as well as devise  methods for incorporating application and workload constraints  and characteristics into resource management techniques.  Such  media-aware, workload-aware, and application-aware storage  organization and access mechanisms can significantly improve  performance of a storage server.  ***",
