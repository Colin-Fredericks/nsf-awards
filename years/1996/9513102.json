Liebermann of the State  University of New York at Stony Brook and Professor Tetsuo  Irifune of Ehime University.  The collaborators assembled  also include faculty and postdoctoral staff of the Mineral  Physics Institute at Stony Brook and Hokkaido University.  This proposal will address some of the most important areas  of research on  the elastic and rheological properties of  the high-pressure phases of mantle minerals.  The objective  of this research is an improved understanding of the  dynamical processes in the Earth's interior.    This proposal brings together research scientists from two  countries working in complimentary ways on mineral physics  and chemistry.  The U. S. scientists will have the  opportunity to become familiar with the high-pressure  facilities at Ehime University and the electron microscope  facilities of Hokkaido University. Therefore, this proposal  fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and  transfer of scientific knowledge through international  collaboration.  ***",
