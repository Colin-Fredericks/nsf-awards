 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with diophantine approximation and value  distribution theory of holomorphic functions. Work by P. Vojta,  C. Osgood, and others has shown that these two fields are in fact  connected by a formal analogy. This observation has led to new  conjectures, shorter proofs of old theorems, and proofs of new  theorems. This project will continue this trend, primarily  working in the field of diophantine approximation. Results whose  proofs may be simplified include finiteness theorems for rational  points on abelian varieties and Faltings' theorem on the  finiteness of principally polarized abelian varieties over a  given field with finite reduction. New results which may be  proved include \"moving targets\" type results; i.e., diophantine  approximation statements which involve a slowly varying family of  equations. A distant goal is the \"abc conjecture.\" Technical  improvements in proofs using Thue's method will also be pursued.   This research falls into the general mathematical field of Number  Theory.  Number theory has its historical roots in the study of  the whole numbers,  addressing such questions as those dealing  with the divisibility of one  whole number by another. It is  among the oldest branches of mathematics and  was pursued for  many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within  the  last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse   applications in areas such as data transmission and processing,  and  communication systems.",
