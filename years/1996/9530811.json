 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops a new class of data acquisition systems with user  configurable hardware.  The primary development effort is the creation of  software tools which will enable scientists and engineers who are not skilled  hardware designers to utilize such systems.  Some of the primary research issues  are the development of techniques for specifying and analyzing timing behavior  between fixed and configurable hardware and the development of techniques for  designing robust interfaces.    A typical application of this work is a reconfigurable data acquisition card  consisting of a fixed analog section and a configurable digital section built  from one or more field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and static RAM chips.   Existing data acquisition cards are generally used by scientists and engineers  who are not skilled hardware designers; however, the currently available tools  for FPGAs require significant digital design experience.  For a reconfigurable  data acquisition card to be useful, it is necessary that the configuration tools  accept as input high level programming language which is accessible to a  competent programmer.  Any custom hardware necessary to interface the analog  sections or host CPU must be provided in the form of libraries which can be  conveniently linked to the user's code.",
