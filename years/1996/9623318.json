 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to investigate methods for providing  reliable transmission  of compressed information - speech, images, video,  and data - over the bandlimited, fading channels that characterize mobile  communication systems.  The research will focus on two (intersecting) lines  of investigation: (i) Error control strategies that exploit the properties  of data compression algorithms: The goal here will be to make effective use  of the \"residual redundancy\" remaining in signals after compression;  virtually all presently-used source coding schemes leave some such  redundancy, and channel decoders that are \"tuned\" to exploit it can offer  substantial gain over decoders that are not. (Recent results regarding CELP  speech coding show 2-5 dB of gain.) (ii)The design analysis, and  implementation of error control codes specifically for digital mobile  communication.  It is well known that the distance properties that make a  code \"good\" for additive white Gaussian noise channels are not the most  important design properties for codes to be used over fading channels.  Recently, the P.I. and collaborators have developed an approach to code  design for fading channels that results in significantly improved  performance with respect to the \"traditional\" approach; this research will  extend the work in this area, developing new codes and analyzing their  performance in a variety of contexts - including the synergy between the  codes and \"diversity reception\" (i.e., multiple antennas) and the  performance of the codes at low signal-to-noise ratios.  The work to be  undertaken will be a mixture of code design, analysis, and simulation.  Successful completion of the proposed research will result in a capability  to support multi-media transport over mobile communication channels.",
