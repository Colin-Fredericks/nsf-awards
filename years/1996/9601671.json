 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to the pattern of human occupation and land use in Lancaster  County and Southcentral Pennsylvania, where nearly two thirds of  the land is in agricultural use, significant populations of  native species are restricted largely to forested areas on the  low mountains in the northern portion of the region and riparian  forests in the southern portion. The first goal of this research  project is to examine selected elements of the biodiversity of  riparian forests of southcentral Pennsylvania in an attempt to  understand the nature and distribution of organisms and the  impact of continued human expansion and growth on population  densities and reproductive successes of these nonhuman species.  Instrumentation acquired through this research proposal will  greatly expand the research capacity of the Department of Biology  at Millersville University in order to pursue the following  specific topics dealing with biodiversity:  1. the genetic diversity of populations of rare-endangered ferns,     Vittaria and Trichomanes  2. the distribution of rare-endangered plants in Southcentral     Pennsylvania  3. the impact of habitat fragmentation on mammal and bird     populations  4. the composition and distribution of riparian plant communities     in the southern     Susquehanna River drainage.    Many of the problems of poor water quality, environmental  degradation, decline in beds of submerged aquatic vegetation, and  reductions in population densities of valuable fishery species,  including shellfish, in the Chesapeake Bay have been attributed  to high inputs of plant nutrients, such as phosphorus and  nitrogen from non-point sources in the Susquehanna River  drainage. Agricultural fertilizers and manures from livestock  account for 75% of the phosphorus and 50% of the nitrogen  entering the Chesapeake Bay. With nearly 400,000 acres of  agricultural land, over 600,000 cows, steers and pigs, and over  55,000,000 chickens, Lancaster County's contribution to the  non-p oint source pollution of the Chesapeake is huge. The  vegetation of riparian forests has been identified as one type of  buffer reducing this pollution by trapping eroding soil and  absorbing soluble nutrients. Once in the aquatic environment the  nutrients stimulate alga blooms, which reduce water quality; a  major factor in the degradation of the Bay. The second goal of  this proposal is to examine biological activities in the riparian  forest and aquatic ecosystems which might reduce the quantity of  nutrients flowing into the water or control alga populations that  reduce water quality. Acquisition of equipment will facilitate  research in:  I. restoration of aquatic ecosystems through viral control of  alga blooms  2. effects of plant root systems and the associated mycorrhizal  fungi on nutrient flow through raparian vegetation.    Acquisition of the requested equipment will greatly expand  opportunities for undergraduate students to become involved in  research projects at Millersville University. After graduation,  many undergraduates from Millersville University pursue  scientific careers through graduate studies at large research  universities. Acquisition of research equipment will facilitate  undergraduate research and nurture aspirations of careers in  science.",
