 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is a broad  study on the syntheses and   metabolism of chlorophylls and derivatives.  The biosynthetic origin of   macrocyclic carbons in the bacteriochlorophyll-e will be investigated and   the degradation of the molecules in senescent bacteria studied.    Synthetic studies will be aimed at the production of a variety of targets   including 3,8-divinylchlorophyll-a, isochlorophyll-a, a conformationally   locked phytochromobilin and a series of non-planar porphyrins and   chlorins.  Stable phlorins and corroles will also be constructed with the   goal of producing bis-macrocycles. With this award, the Synthetic Organic   Program is supporting the research of Dr. Kevin M. Smith of the   Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Davis.  Dr.   Smith will focus his work on a broad-based and wide-ranging study of the   biosynthesis, catabolism, chemistry and spectroscopy of novel porphyrins,   chlorophylls and bacteriochlorophylls.   Chlorophylls are the catalysts   in the vital process of photosynthesis and are involved in light   gathering as well as the process of charge separation.  Certain   porphyrins and their metal complexes are to be studied as biomimics of   chlorophylls found in photosynthetic organisms and as molecules with   potential biomedical implications.",
