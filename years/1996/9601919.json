 "awd_abstract_narration": "9601919  Kak    This award supports the participation of 20 senior U.S.  graduate students in a U.S.-Japan Graduate Student Forum  entitled \"Robotics of Today and Tomorrow for Advanced  Automation and Other Societal Applications\" to be held at  Senri Life Science Center, Osaka, Japan, November 8 and 9,  1996.  The co-organizers are Professor Avi Kak of Purdue  University and Professor Yoshiaki Shirai of Osaka  University.  An equal number of superior graduate students  will be selected from the Japanese universities;  participation of the Japanese students will be supported by  separate funds raised in Japan.  The specific aims of the  Forum are to: (1) foster collaborative links between the  promising graduate students -- the future leaders in  research and development -- in robotics and automation in  the two countries; (2) review the current state-of-the-art  in robotics and automation; (3) discuss the disparities that  exist between the experiments that can be carried out in the  best university laboratories and the somewhat lagging state-  of-the-art of the best robotic practices in industry in the  two countries; (4) discuss future directions for research  and development and how projects carried out jointly between  the two countries can help  with the realization of the future.  ***",
