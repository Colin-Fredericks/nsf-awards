Mehrabadi of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at  Tulane University and Professor Yuji Kishino of the  Department of Civil Engineering at Tohoku University in  Sendai, Japan.  Project funding will enable Dr. Mehrabadi to  spend six months in Japan, resident at Tohoku University, in  order to study topics in mechanics of granular materials  including a study of the influence of microstructure on  their macroscopic behavior. Tohoku University which has been  the site of two U.S.-Japan seminars on the continuum and  statistical approaches in the mechanics of granular  materials, has had a traditionally strong research program  in this field.  Professor Mehrabadi and his coworkers have  previously developed important analytical results and  algorithms for the description of stress, fabric, and strain  in granular materials.  He and his students have also  developed a unique method to simulate granular media using  the Linear Programming.  Professor Kishino has developed his  own numerical simulation model and has many interesting  ideas with regard to modeling of the granular material  response. Using his simulation model, he has characterized  the dissipation mechanism in a granular assembly by means of  a set of geometrical and statistical quantities.  He has  also developed micromechanical models of the liquifaction  phenomena and strain localization. In this project,  Professor Mehrabadi will combine his expertise with that of  Professor Kishino to develop and validate an improved  simulation model for studying the influence of  microstructure on the mechanical response of granular media.    This proposal brings together research scientists from two  countries working in the area of mechanics of granular  materials.  The U. S. scientist will have the opportunity to  become familiar with the experimental facilities and  research methods provided by the Tohoku University while  contributing to the overall  research effort. Therefore, this  proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its  exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an  international collaboration.  ***",
