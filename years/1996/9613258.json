 "awd_abstract_narration": "9613258  Watts  Physicochemical processes that can enhance the biodegradability  of biorefractory organic compounds in process water can serve as  a basis for waste reduction, toxicity reduction, and water  conservation through the recycling.  The proposed research  investigates coexisting chemical and biological oxidations in  hybrid advanced oxidation process (AOP)-biological systems.  The  AOP is an iron oxyhydroxide-catalyzed Fentonlike reaction in  which hydroxyl radicals are generated by heterogeneous catalysis  at the mineral surface.  Abiotic-biotic systems containing low  microbial numbers may be dominated by Fenton-like oxidations.  Conversely, systems with high biomass would likely be  characterized by fewer Fenton-like oxidations because the  hydrogen peroxide would be decomposed by catalase.  However,  under optimal proportions of abiotic and biotic mechanisms,  hydroxyl radicals generated in a microenvironment at the mineral  surface would modify biorefractory compounds and subsequent  transformation of the oxidation products would then be promoted  by a coexisting consortium of aerobic bacteria.    Perchloroethylene will be used as a hydroxyl radical probe.  13C-  labeled pyruvate will be used to  assay microbial metabolism.  A series of experiments will  investigate interactions of biomass, hydrogen peroxide  concentration, iron oxyhydroxide mineral concentration, and  phosphate stabilization of hydrogen peroxide in promoting  parallel abiotic-biotic oxidations.  Transformation reactions  will be confirmed by monitoring 14C-labeled perchloroethylene;  degradation products will be tracked by gas chromatography/mass  spectrometry and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry of 13C-  labeled perchloroethylene to differentiate its products from the  mass spectra of natural organic compounds.  The results will  provide fundamental data that can be applied to on site hybrid  abiotic-biotic systems.  ***",
