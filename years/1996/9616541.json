 "awd_abstract_narration": "9616541  David R. Hayes  This award provides support for the Five Colleges Number Theory  Seminar.  This is a regular seminar supported by five colleges in  the New England area. The seminar provides a center for the  research efforts of faculty in the five colleges who are  specialists in number theory and arithmetic geometry. It also  serves the undergraduate and graduate students at the five  colleges who are interested in number theory and arithmetic  geometry.  This proposal is in the general area of number theory.  Number theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole  numbers,  addressing such questions as those dealing with the  divisibility of one  whole number by another. It is among the  oldest branches of mathematics and  was pursued for many  centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within  the last  half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse   applications in areas such as data transmission and processing,  and  communication systems.",
