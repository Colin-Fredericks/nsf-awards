They propose to install a continuously operating broadband seismic  and space-based geodetic monitoring system on Volcan Arenal, an active volcano in north-central Costa Rica.   Their goal is to use the data collected to gain a better understanding of volcanic processes, such as magma conduit initiation and magma transport, and to integrate this knowledge with observations of precursory deformation, leading to improvements in volcano eruption forecasting.  Only a few volcanoes world-wide are presently being monitored with geodetic instrumentation.  In almost all of these, measurements are made too infrequently, or the land-based techniques are too imprecise to define the time-varying signal associated with volcanic deformation.  The researchers will remove these limitations by installing a continuously operating monitoring system .  This information will be beneficial not only to the two parti cipating countries, but also  to other countries with active volcanoes.  ***                                                         Oh     +'  0                                       $       H       l                                               D       h                                                   R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       9507828                             Beverly D.
