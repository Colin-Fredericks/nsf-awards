In particular, the  industrial leaders focus their discussions and presentations  on identifying the future needs in the areas of intelligent  systems, including their architecture and their components  such as computers, controls, sensors and actuators. The  researchers from the academe and the national laboratories  analyze the needs of the industry and define research  directions which would enable the industry to meet the  challenges of the 21st century. The support for the workshop  is provided by the National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST), the Electric Power Research Institute  (EPRI) in addition to the National Science Foundation  (NSF).***",
