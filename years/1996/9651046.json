 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project uses MacLab physiological recording equipment as part of a comprehensive three-phase plan designed to strengthen the undergraduate program in Biological Sciences.  Phase I (Building Improvement) and Phase II (Upgrade of Instructional Aids) have been addressed.  Phase III (Curriculum Enhancement) is addressed by this project.  The MacLab recording equipment is being integrated into all levels of the curriculum.  Of particular interest is the integration of the MacLab into Level III.  Having been introduced to the MacLab on a demonstration basis (Level I) and had practical experience in the use of the MacLab (Level II), students are required to design, conduct, and present a reasonably sophisticated research project using the equipment as part of their advanced training (Level III).  The addition of a required research component to the undergraduate curriculum is necessary to prepare students adequately for postgraduate life as teachers, researchers, and health care practitioners.",
