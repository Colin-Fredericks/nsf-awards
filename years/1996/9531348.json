 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of  ten  undergraduate biology students each year, the majority of whom  are expected to be African-American, in the Research Experiences  for Undergraduates program offered by the Mt. Desert Island  biologicalLaboratory in Salsbury Cove, Maine.  This program, will  allow each student to spend eight weeks working at the bench,  paired with a senior scientist leading a research team working on  timely questions involving marine physiology.  Using sharks,  skates, flounder and other sea animals, students will explore  questions at the mechanistic level concerning reproduction,  osmoregulation, acid base balance and ion transport.  Orientation  lectures on basic concepts of marine physiology and molecular  biology during the first week will be supplemented by weekly  evening lectures on these subjects designed to encourage  discussion by the students.  Undergraduates will attend three  weekly laboratory-wide science seminars on topics related to  marine physiology.  They will participate in a campus-wide ethics  course taught by expert lecturers and by group discussions of  cases illustrating the ethical issues with which scientists are  confronted.  Four noontime discussions led by knowledgeable  ethicists and involving REU students and their mentors will  address subjects such as the use of animals and humans as  research subjects, ethics of genetics research and environmental  ethics.  The research experience will be completed by each  student giving a talk to the laboratory community on his/her  results and writing a research paper for publication in the  laboratory Bulletin.       This award will foster the continued education and training  of individuals who will be part of the next generation of basic  researchers in marine physiology.  It will also help to inform  young citizens about ethical questions in science and aspects of  management and decision making in environmental issues.",
