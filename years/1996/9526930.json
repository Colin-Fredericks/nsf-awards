 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shen, Holbrook, and ten Brink  OPP 9526930    Abstract    The interpretation of the stratigraphy of the glaciated  continental shelves and the reconstruction of past ice sheet  fluctuations from the stratigraphy require understanding of  the relationships among the stratal geometry, glacial and  marine sedimentary processes, and ice dynamics.  Previous  work investigated the formation of the morphology and the  broad stratal geometry of the Antarctic continental shelf  with 2-D structure-imitating models.  Several  generalizations were proposed regarding processes that form  the glaciated Antarctic shelves and several guidelines were  proposed for the interpretation of stratigraphic features.    This award supports work to expand the modeling efforts in  three new directions:    1). constructing 3-D models to account for the differences    in glacial morphology and stratigraphy between cross-    shelf troughs and banks;  2). improving the structure-imitating models and developing    process-based models.  We will treat ice advance and    retreat as continuous, autoregressive processes instead    of discrete steps in our previous models.  In the process-    based models, erosion and deposition will be determined    by the velocity of basal ice or the basal shear stress.    Glacial erosion and deposition will be coupled with    models of aqueous sedimentary processes.  3). making detailed comparison to newly compiled data sets    from the Antarctic and the SE Greenland shelves, and in    doing so improving our understanding of the stratigraphy    of the glaciated continental shelf.    This work is important to understanding the past behavior of ice  sheets in both the northern and southern polar regions.",
