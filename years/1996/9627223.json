One, test structures are designed, fabricated, and evaluated on wafers costing upwards of  $1000 and requiring several weeks of manufacture.  The second method involves computer simulations of limited accuracy, long runtimes, and poor convergence.  Neither method is completely satisfactory in terms of cost, time, and accuracy.    Given the continuing decrease in computing cost, modeling and simulation of semiconductor processes and devices, collectively known as Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD), is an increasingly useful tool for process engineers.  Much research has been done in this area but the results have not been adequate for industrial use while industry needs continue to grow.  Historically, commercial TCAD tools have lagged leading-edge process development by one generation. Thus, increased effort in TCAD research and commercialization is a critical need, as identified by the Semiconductor Industry Association.    This proposal addresses the need for improved device simulation by investigating the feasibility of using additive decomposition in the solution of the semiconductor device equations.  We are specifically interested in implementing the semiconductor hydrodynamic model in a practical, computationally efficient, parallelized device simulation tool use in a industrial setting.  The hydrodynamic model is chosen for three reasons.  First, hot electrons degrade long-term reliability through shifts in transistor threshold voltage and the hydrodynamic model has been shown to accurately model the hot electron effect in submicron MOSFETs.  Second, the semiconductor hydrodynamic model is much cheaper computationally than the Monte Carlo method.  Third, previous work developing the hydrodynamic model predicts accurate simulation of  MOS devices to gate lengths of  0.1um.    Numerical robustness and computational cost are roadblocks to practical use of the hyd rodynamic model.  The proposed work is a novel approach to semiconductor device simulation by application of additive decomposition, a technique for decomposing governing equations into large-scale and small-scale parts without averaging that has been successfully applied to Burgers' equation and the Navier-Stokes equations governing fluid flow.  To our knowledge, no researcher has applied additive decomposition to the semiconductor device model.  The additive decomposition technique is particularly well suited to problems with a large range to time and/or space scales, as found in the carrier concentration and carrier temperature in submicron MOS devices, leading to convergence difficulties and requiring robust numerical techniques in the solution method.  Furthermore, additive decomposition adds another level of parallelization, improving the computational cost.    The project investigates the feasibility of the additive decomposition technique applied to the one-dimensional semiconductor equations.  The drift-diffusion model is a simple version of the hydrodynamic model and is, thus, an ideal vehicle for the feasibility study.  The test case is the submicron ballistic diode with an n+-n-n+  structure, which captures the essential features of the MOS channel.  The proposed work develops and tests the discretization and parallelization schemes for the one-dimensional drift-diffusion model using additive decomposition.
