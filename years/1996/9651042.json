 "awd_abstract_narration": "The College of Natural Sciences is developing a computer-based SMART LAB (Science/Math Active Response Technology Laboratory) to support interdisciplinary, undergraduate learning in science and mathematics. The learning model for the laboratory is technology mediated, allowing for active student response to science/math topics through involvement in cooperative learning groups, which design, complete, and report on lab projects. Laboratories use topic-based investigations, which are structured to emphasize the interconnected nature of the science disciplines and mathematics, both through the particular exercises used and through collaborative interchange within and beyond the immediate lab setting. The SMART LAB serves as a locus for exchange of data, insights, and science/math concepts among classes in different disciplines using the lab. Computers function in four major roles:  as device controllers for laboratory data acquisition; as analytical tools for the visualization, inspection, evaluation, and interpretation of lab data; as gateways to network data resources relevant to the lab projects; and as links for communication with other educational communities, such as South Dakota tribal and nontribal K-12 classrooms and other undergraduate science/math classes, both in the United States and abroad.   Preservice secondary science/math education majors in combined Education/Natural Sciences programs and preservice elementary education majors are a substantial part of the student population addressed by the project. Learning science by doing science, the central theme of the SMART LAB, is particularly important in the preparation of K-12 science teachers. Those preservice teachers, as well as other undergraduate majors, benefit from the shared knowledge and the network links between the laboratory and other classrooms (K-12, tribal colleges, universities). By assuming the role of mentor/teacher, college students in the SMART LAB add significantly to their own comprehension of the particular lab topics and of general science/math concepts.",
