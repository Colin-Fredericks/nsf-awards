 "awd_abstract_narration": "The behavior of an organism is a set of characters that is just  as critical to the understanding of biology as the morphological  and physiological features of the individual. Statistically  robust description of behavioral processes is, unfortunately,  more difficult to obtain than in the more traditional fields of  biology. Especially when the task is to indicate the occurrence  of subtle behavioral changes, merely counting the number or  duration of a behavior pattern is insufficient. Recent  applications of Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) models to  Ethology have shown great promise as a descriptive and  hypothesis-testing tool. Researchers have indicated otherwise  undetectable changes of sub-threshold doses of amphetamines and  electrical stimulation of the brain. Unfortunately, many of the  statistical techniques available are poorly suited for fitting  CTMC models to behavior for a variety of reasons such as high  alpha error rates, inability to deal with normally encountered  sample sizes, number of ties and censored observations, and the  need to have computationally simple solutions that can be used as  standard PC-based routines.    This project will consider the design and implementation of  generalizations of the CTMC model. In particular, while the  transition times in such models usually follow simple exponential  distributions, this project will examine the possibility that  these times follow a distribution with nonconstant,  piecewise-constant hazard rates. The goal is to create  computationally efficient, unbiased, robust statistical  techniques to fit such models, paying special attention to  estimation of, and inference on, the time or times when the  hazard rate changes. These techniques will then be evaluated by  testing them on both actual and simulated data sets.",
