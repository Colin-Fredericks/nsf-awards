 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600165  Mark    This three year award supports collaboration on novel  polymeric materials between James Mark, University of  Cincinnati, and Pham Huu Ly, Institute of Chemistry,  National Center for Natural Science and Technology, Hanoi,  Vietnam.  The proposed research will investigate the  reinforcement of natural rubber, a common substance in  Vietnam and therefore of great interest to researchers  there.  The proposed research is of fundamental and  practical interest to the US as well. The primary general  goal is to apply some of the latest processing technologies  to natural rubber, and to other natural resources, to  produce modern, high-performance materials.  The potential  for producing more environmentally benign materials is an  important implication of this research. This mutually  beneficial choice of research topics seems well-suited for  the early stages of cooperation with Vietnam.    The National Center for Natural Science and Technology in  Vietnam is the premiere research arm of the government..  Because natural rubber is so important to Vietnam, there has  been a relatively well-funded research effort in polymer  science at the Institute of Chemistry.  This proposal draws  on experience gained by the PI in earlier interaction with  Dr. Ly, on common research interests, and on complementary  expertise. Plans call for training of a Vietnamese  researcher at the University of Cincinnati, and for  exchanges of research visits.",
