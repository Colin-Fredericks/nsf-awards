The conference has the major aim of bringing together one hundred and fifty investigators from a large number of disciplines working on different aspects of various ATPases to exchange ideas and the latest information on structure, function and regulation of these important enzymes. These scientists represent a cadre of disciplines which include biochemistry, biology, biophysics, chemistry, genetics, molecular biology, pharmacology, physics and physiology. Transport ATPases are widely distributed in cells and subcellular organelles. In the forward transport mode, they utilize chemical energy il the form of ATP to build ionic gradients. This energy transduction is key to excitability, contractility, secretion, and overall cell function. The amount of ATP (and therefore nutrients and oxygen) consumed by these ATPases is extremely large. Immense progress that has taken place in this field is evident: several ATPases have been cloned; isozymes have been found; hormonal regulation of expression has been documented; several structural insights have been provided by x-ray diffraction, low angle diffraction and site-directed mutagenesis; new transport ATPases such as the one for Mg2+ transport have been described and characterized. This conference will focus on the variations in structure, regulation and physiological significance among different ATPases which have been described during the last few years. The interactive environment should greatly stimulate collaborative efforts and help identify new directions for future research in addition to new tools and approaches, already successful for established ATPases, which may be applied to newly discovered transporting enzymes.  %%%  Transport ATPases are proteins that are capabl e of utilizing the energy stored in ATP to transport various ions or molecules across cellular membranes.  This form of energy transduction is involved in many biological processes, such as nerve conduction, muscle contraction, secretion, and overall cellular homeostasis.  This meeting will try to integrate knowledge on the various transport ATPases in the hopes of finding unifying features as well as novel approaches to the study of newly discovered transporting enzymes.  ***",
