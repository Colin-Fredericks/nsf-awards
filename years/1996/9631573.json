 "awd_abstract_narration": "9631573  WATANABE    Visual perception is often considered a passive and simple event.  This view derives partly from the general assumption that visual  information goes only from the retina to higher-level areas in  the brain, and not in the other direction.  However, recent  anatomical and physiological findings indicate that there are  massive feedback pathways in the brain along which information is  carried from these higher-level brain areas back to low-level  areas, including those processing visual information.  It is not  yet well known what role these feedback projections play in  visual information processing in the brain.    This research is concerned with the role of attention, one of the  most important cognitive functions originating in higher brain  areas.  It will examine what level of visual processing is the  lowest that can be influenced by attention.  Answering this  question will lead to a better understanding of the role of  feedback projections from high-level brain areas, where cognitive  functions likely originate, to lower level visual processing.  In  a series of experiments, people will watch a moving object on a  computer display and will be instructed to pay attention only to  a local contour of the object.  One minute after the onset of the  moving object, each person's sensitivity to motion in several  directions, such as upward and rightward, will be measured.      Motion processing is known to have at least two stages:  In the  first stage, the direction of motion of the whole object is not  detected by the visual system.   Only the many local motion  components perpendicular to the local contours of a moving object  are detected.  This stage begins in the primary visual cortex in  which very low-level visual processing occurs.  In the second  stage, the signals from detection of the directions of these  local motion components are integrated, so that the true  direction of motion of the entire object can be calculated.       In these experiments, if attention  influences the first stage of  motion processing, sensitivity to the originally attended local  motion should decrease.  On the other hand, if attention does not  influence such a low-level stage of processing, sensitivity to  the direction of motion should not be influenced by the  allocation of attention.  A preliminary experimental result using  only two people indicated that the former is the case.  If this  result is confirmed with additional people, it will indicate that  attention can influence even very primitive stages of visual  information processing, leading to the conclusion that feedback  projections play a very important role in making visual  perception active and influenced by high-level cognitive  functions, rather than entirely passive and automatic.     These results should have important implications for the design  of computer vision systems, a very difficult computer problem.  ***",
