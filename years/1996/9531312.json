 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of  10       undergraduate students each year in the Research Experiences       for Undergraduates program offered by Southwestern Missouri       State University.  This is an exciting program that offers       opportunities for research experience  in tropical studies.       Participants will learn and develop research skills by       interacting with faculty as they work on projects dealing       with tropical vertebrate communities in Mexico.  To foster       student development, a three-phase program is planned:  1)       Orientation - introducing students to research methodology       and ecological studies in Mexico; 2) Apprenticeship -       developing skills; and 3) Individual research - resulting in       publication-quality reports.  Seminars on research and       graduate studies are included to facilitate applications of       acquired knowledge and skills to participants' future       academic pursuits; presentations will be made by scientists       in both the United States and Mexico.  Faculty mentors will       \"coach\" students, instilling a vision of research by       explaining the rules of science and delivering a feeling of       the excitement that comes with addressing questions with       conceptual orientations.  The theme or focus of the program       is vertebrate communities.  To capitalize on faculty       expertise, students will be encouraged to choose projects       involving fishes, amphibians, reptiles, or mammals, although       studies of other organisms are possible.  Investigations may       address aspects of niche dimensions, behavior, parasitic       infections, or systematics.  Students may choose projects       within these topics or develop investigations of their own.            This award will foster the continued education and  training of individuals who   will be part of the next generation  of basic researchers in tropical ecology.  With global  attention focused of the loss of biodiversity , especially in the  tropics, this is an area of   critical concern for the sustained  economic development and, in fact, the cultural survival    of  many developing nations.",
