Such cases, particularly among the insects and  spiders, are interesting because they represent deviations  from the more typical mating pattern of male polygyny with  little material investment.  The functional significance and  ecological conditions controlling increased male investment  in insects has been a topic of interest for behavioral  ecologists and evolutionary biologists.  The proposed  project will increase understanding of mating systems where  males provide nuptial gifts by determining the conditions  under which the most extreme type of male nuptial feeding --  male copulatory suicide--can be selected.  This project is a  comparative study of two congeneric spider species  (Latrodectus hasselti and L. geometricus) in which males  appear to sacrifice themselves to females during copulation.  Field observations of daily movements, courtship behavior  and mating success will be combined with staged laboratory  interactions and estimations of reproductive output to  characterize the mating system, selective pressures, and  demographic characteristics of these two species.  Information gathered from this species will be used to  produce a model for the selection of male copulatory suicide  that will place the behavior within the existing framework  of sexual selection theory.",
