This biennial conference is open to all those interested in behavioral ecology.  It is held in alternate years from the International Ethological Conference (IEC) and is the primary international gathering of scientists focusing on the ecological correlates of behavior in an evolutionary framework.  The meeting brings together workers from a variety of countries and offers an  unparalleled opportunity for young American behavioral ecologists to meet colleagues in the Australiasian region, share their work with an international audience, and become introduced to Australia's unique biota and its associated conservation problems.",
