The tendency of Th to preferentially  come out of good tracer for particle dynamics (production,  destruction, sinking, mixing).  However, the computations involved  are model-based, and the models currently used are rather  simplistic. In this research, the PI and his coworkers at Texas A&M   University will conduct laboratory experiments to determine the  sorption-description kinetic properties of Th in seawater with  particles, organic molecules, and colloids aggregate into larger  and larger aggregates, a process responsible for the formation of  new particles in marine and other natural waters.  The results will  finally be folded into a more realistic model of Th behavior that  should help marine chemists and geochemists use the Th tracer more  confidently and with a better understanding of its limitations as  well as its utility.",
