This Research Planning Grant proposal addresses this shortcoming through the collection of data that will enable the investigator to examine the relationship between poverty and economic inequality and Latino homicide in Miami, Florida between 1989-1993.  Data (i.e., date, time, location of homicide event and age, gender, race/ethnicity of offender and victim) from the Miami Police Department homicide files will be supplemented by US Census income, poverty, educational and population data.  This study will test a series of hypotheses related to economic correlates of homicide using localized measures (by census tracts) to predict variations in homicide rates.  Using census tracts as the level of  the analysis is far more sophisticated than most similar work that relies on measures that aggregate data at the city or state level.  This data set will be unique in criminology and will provide the basis for future comparative efforts with Latino subpopulations in other geographic areas.",
