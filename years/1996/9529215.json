 "awd_abstract_narration": "9529215  Nakamura    This award supports a 24 month Science and Technology Agency  of Japan (STA) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Takashi  Nakamura at the National Foods Research Institute, Tsukuba,  Japan.  Dr. Nakamura will work with Dr. Mitsutoshi Nakajima  of the Process Engineering Laboratory on a research project  entitled \"Purification of Inulin and Inulo-oligasaccharides  through Enzyme Extraction and Nanofiltration of the  Jerusalem Artichoke\".    The proposed research will concentrate on membrane  technology and its application to the purification of fats  and sugars from agricultural and biological products.  For  sugars, the focus of the application of membrane technology  will be on the Jerusalem artichoke, a Hokkaido agricultural  product, and the extraction and purification of inulin and  inulo-oligosaccharides.  The use of the appropriate enzymes  in the hydrolysis of fats and oligasaccharides as well as  establishing a well supported model to accurately predict  the permeate flux are necessary in creating viable and cost-  effective membrane technologies for the food industry.  As  the use of fats and sugars are widespread in the food  industry, the research will investigate and determine the  degree to which membrane technologies can be used to achieve  cost-efficient industrial processing.    The proposed research is of considerable theoretical and  practical interest to the bio-engineering community and the  benefits to be obtained from collaborative research will be  valuable to both participants.  Furthermore, the research  will likely yield positive results for the United States and  Japan as well as the international scientific community as a  whole.  As such, the research satisfies the objectives of  the program in its emphasis on the exchange and transfer of  scientific knowledge through international collaboration.  ***",
