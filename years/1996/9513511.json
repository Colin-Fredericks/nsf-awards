 "awd_abstract_narration": "9513511  Preuss   Genetic approaches will be used to investigate further the requirements for pollen recognition by the stigma. Suppressing mutations that restore function to pop1(cer6-2) pollen, a mutant which has a defect in pollen pistil interactions, have been identified and examining these suppressors will likely identify key pollen components. In addition, novel genetic screens for gene products required for pollen-stigma interactions will be done. These screens will focus on genes expressed in the haploid pollen and make use of the recently identified quartet mutations that cause pollen to be released in intact tetrads. The specific aims are:  1.  Examine suppressors that restore fertility to cer6 pollen. Determine whether lipid and protein components have been restored and whether the suppressing mutations map to genes other than cer6.  2.  Perform a screen for gametophytic mutations that disrupt pollen-stigma interactions by using chemical mutagenesis of quartet seeds to screen for genes required for pollen hydration and to use insertional mutagenesis to characterize genes required for subsequent events in the reproductive process.  %%%  The focus of this work is on genetic approaches that will identify Arabidopsis gene products essential for the initial step in pollination-recognition of pollen by the stigma cells. Because plants rely on insects and wind for pollination, they encounter pollen grains from many different species. However, only pollen from the appropriate species is permitted to grow through the pistil and deliver sperm to the eggs. An improved understanding of the molecular basis for pollen recognition would be a major advance.  ***",
