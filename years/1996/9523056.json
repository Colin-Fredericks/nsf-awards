 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program   provides continued support for research by Dr. M. David Curtis of the   Chemistry Department, University of Michigan, on the reactivity of model   complexes for dehydrosulfurization (HDS) catalysts.  The specific   objectives of the project are to determine (1) how the composition,   physical and electronic structure, and redox properties of molybdenum or   tungsten sulfide clusters correlate with their reactivity toward organic   sulfur compounds; (2) the mechanisms of the desulfurization reactions   mediated by the metal cluster complexes; and (3) how the mechanisms of   desulfurizations on discrete clusters are related to the mechanisms of   desulfurization over the heterogeneous HDS catalysts used in the   petroleum industry for fuel upgrading.   The experimental approaches to   these objectives include the synthesis of new sulfide bimetallic   clusters, kinetic and structural studies of their reactions with organic   sulfur compounds, electrochemical studies, and comparative studies with   actual heterogeneous catalysts.  Of particular interest are those HDS   reactions catalyzed by molybdenum sulfide catalysts `promoted` with iron,   cobalt, or nickel and the role played by the promoter metal in increasing   the activity of the catalyst.  Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) is a commercial process used to remove sulfur   from organic materials and is therefore important in manufacturing and to   enhancing air quality in industrial areas.   In this project, compounds   which are models of the industrial catalyst will be prepared and their   reactivity investigated.   Knowledge of the mechanistic role of the   promoter in desulfurization catalysts can be applied to the design of   `second generation` hydrotreating catalysts that possess higher   activities and selectivities than those currently in use.",
