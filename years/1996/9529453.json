 "awd_abstract_narration": "9529453  Marks    Past  research by the principal investigator has shown  that  small  particles of silver grown on silicon  (001)  surfaces  are  not single crystals, but instead a variety of different  morphologies  including  multiple-twinned  particles.   This  project  examines  in  more detail the  structure  of  small  particles  grown  on  silicon and germanium  surfaces  under  ultrahigh  vacuum conditions.  The structure, both  internal  and surface of these particles, is studied in the size range  of  1-20nm.   The  primary experimental  technique  is  high  resolution   electron  microscopy  under  ultrahigh   vacuum  conditions  coupled with more conventional  surface  science  probes.   A question to be explored is the type of particles  in a statistical sense that occur in mixed morphology growth  systems.  %%%  Small   particles   play   an   important   role   in   many  technologically    important   processes,    for    instance  heterogeneous  catalysis, the initial growth  of  many  thin  film   systems,  and  recently  in  the  area  of  nanophase  materials  and quantum dots.  This program examines  aspects  of structure and related impurity effects.  ***",
