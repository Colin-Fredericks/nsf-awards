Project funding will allow Dr. Schlick to spend four months  in residence at TIT, in order to study swollen polymer  networks by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  techniques, and to assess the effect of network structure on  gel heterogeneities and response to meahanical and electric  stimuli. Dr. Ando and co-workers at TIT have solved the  difficulties inherent in MRI of solid state-like samples, by  imaging the highly mobile solvent (especially water)  molecules present in swollen polymer networks. The images  obtained from the solvent molecules can then be interpreted  in terms of network properties. Dr. Schlick has developed  electron spin resonance imaging in two dimensions (2D ESRI),  for imaging of polymeric materials and polymer-supported  catalytic systems. This method has been used recently to  measure the translational diffusion of small and polymeric  tracers in hydrogels that have excellent biological  tolerance and good mechanical properties, and that are  especially useful for the production of contact lenses. This  proposal will therefore combine the expertise of scientists  in two countries, Japan and US, in the field of non-  destructive evaluation of materials by magnetic resonance  imaging techniques. The familiarity of the US scientist with  polymeric systems and ESRI, together with the expertise of  the Japanese group in polymer physics and MRI, are  considered key elements for the success of the collaborative  research plan.  ***",
