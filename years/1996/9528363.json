 "awd_abstract_narration": "9528363  Johnson  We propose a research program in the active control of acoustic  noise (and related problems) using adaptive identification and  control methodologies.  The motivating applications are the control  of acoustic noise in a one dimensional or duct noise scenario (e.g.  heating, ventilation and air conditioning or HVAC applications) as  well as the control of noise in a three dimensional or enclosure  scenario (e.g. automobile or helicopter interiors).  Open problems  to be addressed in this research program concern (a) the systematic  stability analysis of adaptive techniques used in the presence of  intrinsic feedback loops which are caused in these applications by  acoustic feedback and not by the usual closed loop control  configurations assumed in adaptive control theory and (b) the  development and efficient implementation of adaptive filters  especially in the MIMO enclosure problem.  The research program  will clarify the pertinent aspects of adaptive control theory and  practice and thus allow the systematic application of adaptive  techniques.  The research program will be conducted in  collaboration with and will utilize experimental facilities of the  United Technologies Research Center in East Hartford, CT. It is  expected that the multidisciplinary team thus assembled by this  collaboration will allow for wide-ranging and practical research  results to be achieved and broadly disseminated thus making  contributions to both education and commercial interests.  ***",
