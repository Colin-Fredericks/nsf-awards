The primary goal of this project is to identify and quantify the genetic and environmental factors that influence phenotypic plasticity.  Specifically, this research will answer the following pivotal questions: (1) What are the relative roles of genes versus the environment in the plastic expression of traits?  (2) How much do parental behaviors influence phenotypic plasticity in their offspring? (3)  Does phenotypic plasticity impose costs through tradeoffs with other important traits?   These questions will be addressed using the Asian ladybird beetle, Harmonia axyridis.  This beetle is an excellent candidate for quantitative genetic studies and is ecologically and agriculturally important as a predator of several crop pests.  Before H. axyridis can be used as a viable agricultural tool against crop pests, however, more information is needed  on how it responds to variation in the environment.  This research directly addresses that gap by determining the genetic, environmental and evolutionary factors that define the success or failure of newly colonizing populations of H. axyridis.",
