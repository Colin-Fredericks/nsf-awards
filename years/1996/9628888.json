 "awd_abstract_narration": "9628888  Hood        This is a four year Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER)  award which includes both a basic science and a course development  component.  The research will develop and apply a generalized  Lagrangian particle trajectory model for the Chesapeake Bay which  will then be used to develop an individual based, coupled biologic  al and physical model of the sea nettle.   This research will have  two principle goals: The first is to provide a general particle  trajectory model for the Chesapeake Bay research community that can  be used as a tool for physical, chemical and biological research in  the Bay. The second is to use the model to study how the interacti  on between physical and biological processes determines the time  and space distributions of and the impact the sea nettle has upon  its prey in the Chesapeake Bay. The 3-dimensional, time-dependent  flow will be provided by a hydrodynamic circulation model which was  developed as part of the Chesapeake Bay Program. Gelatinous zoopla  nkton data from the NSF LMER-TIES field observational program will  be used for model formulation,  initialization and groundtruthing.       The project meets the NSF's CAREER program objectives because it w  ill allow Dr. Hood to broaden his current ecosystem modeling  research into the realm of individual based and Lagrangian particle  trajectory modeling and develop a research program that focuses on  the Chesapeake Bay. The latter will foster interaction with scient  ists involved in the Chesapeake Bay Program and LMER-TIES. The  project will also allow the principle investigator to develop a  course in his general area of specialization. This course is needed  because it will provide the basic training that biologists need to  carry out coupled biological and physical modeling research and it  is unique because the research will form the basis for instruction.  It is hoped that this training will ultimately facilitate  interaction between biological and physical scient ists and foster  more interdisciplinary research on biological and physical  interactions in marine systems.",
