The project on U-statistics and  processes follows up on fairly recent work of this investigator,  J. Cuzick and E. Gine as well as some work of Anda Gadidov (who  has just obtained her Ph.D. under the direction of this  investigator). The project on correlation inequalities work has  been under way for some time and several results have already  been obtained. In particular, Schechtman, Schlumprecht and this  investigator obtained the desired inequality for ellipsoids.  The  third project follows up on a recently submitted paper (with  Hitczenko, Kwapien, Li, Schechtman, Schlumprecht) on  hypercontractivity of alternating maxima and minima of  multi-indexed independent, identically distributed random  variables.    Classical empirical processes can and have been  used by statisticians to obtain information about basic  characteristicq of a ``population'' using samples collected from  the population. The modern theory, developed over the last twenty  or so years, allows one to study many such characteristics  simultaneously  A component of both the classical and modern  theory studied by this investigator is U-processes, which are, in  a sense, building blocks for general statistical functionals.   Such investigations will help to better assess the accuracy of  statistical procedures currently used in the study of censored  and/or truncated data in Medicine, Astronomy and other fields.  The modern theory of empirical processes has also made  connections with another field of probability, namely, the study  of Gaussian processes. Inequalities for such processes have  played a major role not only in probability--as well as many  other fields of mathematics, such as harmonic analysis, Banach  space theory and, more recently, operator theory--but also in  Theoretical Physics (Quant um field theory).  The Gaussian  Correlation Conjecture is one such outstanding problem in this  area. Many correlation results in, for example, statistical  mechanics, attack one-sided problems. This particular conjecture  attacks a two-sided barrier problem. One hoped for by-product of  a solution to this problem is to other two-sided problems present  in a variety of fields. One of the approaches to this problem,  led to the third project under study by this investigator,  namely, hypercontractivity. In our context hypercontractivity  allows one to change the original formulation of the problem, to  a problem more amenable to some recent advances in the theory of  inequalities for Gaussian processes..",
