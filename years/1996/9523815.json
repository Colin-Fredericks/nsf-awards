 "awd_abstract_narration": "9523815  Camp       Flush communication channels generalize the more conventional  asynchronous one-to-one communication paradigms.  A flush channel  offers the implementor of a distributed application the flexibility  of specifying a message delivery order apropos of the demands of  the application.  This stands in marked contrast to the rigid FIFO  (first-in-first-out) delivery order of communication specified by  a virtual circuit in TCP/IP or specified by a virtual channel in  ATM communication.  The more restrictive the delivery order, the  less concurrency possible to exploit in message transmissions over  a multi-path system.  Flush channels allow the user to define the   delivery of a message to be after the delivery of all messages    previously transmitted, or before the delivery of all messages  subsequently transmitted, or both.  The delivery order between the  sending site and the destination site, created by the user, is a  partial order.       The results from previous work are encouraging.  Flush  communication channels can reduce the mean delivery time of  messages substantially, regardless of the underlying physical  structure of the network.  That is, an implementor of a distributed  application that uses an F-channel can reduce communication costs  whether the communication occurs on routes established for virtual  circuit or datagram in TCP/IP or UDP/IP or on routes established  for the connectionless service class D provided by the ATM  Adaptation Layer.  This possible reduction in mean delivery time of  messages may be critical in meeting real-time requirements of the  application.  However, all previous results only consider  interprocess communication (IPC) for one-to-one communication.  The  goal of this research is to investigate the implications of  implementation and performance when we extend F-channel  communication to many-to-many communication.  ***",
