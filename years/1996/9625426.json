 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports John S. Muenter of   the University of Rochester as he continues his investigations into the   structure and dynamics of highly vibrationally excited states of small   and medium-sized molecules.  He will populate the excited state using   Ti:sapphire laser excitation, then probe the prepared state in the   radiofrequency, microwave or infrared region using molecular beam   electric resonance spectroscopy.  By examining a variety of molecules   with varying densities of states, he can characterize the high energy   vibrational state as intramolecular vibrational relaxation begins to   occur.  The goals are to determine (a) the contributions of various   vibrational modes, including dark states, to the excited state   wavefunctions, and the (b) equilibrium structure and (c) dipole moment of   the excited state.    This knowledge of high energy molecular states will provide important   foundation material for a wide variety of kinetics and dynamics   experiments.  High energy states serve as precursors to a broad range of   chemical reactions.  These experiments are designed to provide   information to maximize the productivity of many kinetics and dynamics   experiments.  In addition, data obtained here will provide exacting tests   of theoretical potential energy surfaces, and the knowledge of high   energy states gained here will allow the construction of more accurate   potential surfaces in the future.  Finally, the techniques developed for   this work can be applied to many other experiments in physical chemistry.",
