The goal of the conference is to enable contacts between the African researchers and their counterparts in North America with the aim of developing mutual cooperation.  The Conference will include both invited and contributed sessions on a range of topics related to manufacturing technology, including manufacturing management, industrialization and technology transfer, and the roles of government, the private sector, and academia in industrialization.  A special session is being devoted to discussion of opportunities for research collaboration among the different countries.  The Conference is an important international meeting and provides opportunities for participants from the United States, Africa, and Asia to share research ideas and develop strategies for more concrete collaborations.  In the long run, the conference should be useful in assisting the development of a local research infrastructure that will support an emerging industrial base on the African continent.",
