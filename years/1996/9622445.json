 "awd_abstract_narration": "deBranges  9622445    In 1984 the present investigator obtained a proof of a conjecture, made in 1916  by Ludwig Bieberbach, estimating the coefficients of power series which  represent injective analytic functions in the unit disk. The proof was included  in a manuscript on square summable power series which motivated the argument  and prepared the way for applications. The verification on the argument  required an extensive visit to the then Soviet Union during which the proof was  separated from its original context. A dim perception of the proof was conveyed  which was insufficient as a guide for further research. The need for such  research was even obscured by the commonly accepted view that an era had come  to a close. The research opportunities generated by the proof were  underestimated. The need of an improved treatment of the theory of square  summable power series became evident. The research required for such a  treatment is the aim of the present project.    The significance of mathematics for the global economy is difficult to assess  because it proceeds through intermediaries in science and engineering. Square  summable power series are an aspect of complex analysis, and also of functional  analysis, which is most closely related to engineering through the theory of  linear systems. The interplay is seen in proofs of the Bieberbach conjecture  which appear in engineering journals. An interplay at a higher level is seen in  proofs of the Bieberbach conjecture which appear in advanced mathematical  texts. The technical and scientific community has in this way expressed its  need for information about the proof. But it has at the same time exposed the  inadequacy of existing knowledge of the proof even among experts. A substantial  effort is required from the author of the proof to surmount these difficulties.",
