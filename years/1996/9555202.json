 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will integrate two semesters each of General  Chemistry, College Physics and Precalculus Mathematics into  one four-semester pre-professional science course, including  both lectures and laboratories.  This dramatic restructuring  experiment with the introductory level science courses is  motivated by the enormous failure rates in our standard  introductory courses.  At present, these failure rates in  our inner-city campus exceed 60%.  A disproportionate number  of these students are women and/or minorities.  Although we  attribute these failure rates to a multitude of factors, the  salient feature appears to be the students' inability to  transfer and apply their knowledge among topics within one  course and between topics across disciplines (such as  mathematics and chemistry).  The primary goal of an  integrated sequence is the explicit transfer and application  of knowledge common to the analytical sciences and  mathematics.  This approach will empower students to become  effective problem-solvers and critical thinkers in the  physical sciences.  The objectives of this integration are  1) to take advantage of the natural connections among  mathematics, physics, and chemistry in order to reinforce  the physical concepts and the mathematical techniques  employed in the quantitative sciences; 2) to promote the  development of effective learning strategies common to all  quantitative sciences; 3) to use the context of chemistry  and physics to motivate students to learn, apply, reinforce  and transfer mathematical methods; 4) to introduce the  fundamental physical concepts that underlie chemistry in a  unified, logical and coherent fashion; and 5) to create a  block learning environment that maintains a unified student  population throughout the quantitative sciences.  We are  well aware that the persistence of an integrated,  interdepartmental course is a major challenge.  However, a  solution to the problem of high failure rates has clear  advantages for the College and for each  of the three  departments involved.  We have received enthusiastic support  from the Chairs of all the involved disciplines and from the  College Administration.  A careful assessment and  documentation of improvement in the quantitative reasoning  skills of students are integral parts of the proposal.  Evidence of improvement can clearly have far-reaching impact  on undergraduate science education in the quantitative  sciences.",
