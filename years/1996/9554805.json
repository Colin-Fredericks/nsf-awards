 "awd_abstract_narration": "This curriculum project focuses on six courses: Introductory  Anatomy & Physiology, Microanatomy, Developmental Biology,  Statistics, Mathematical Modeling, and Math Seminar. The project  addresses the dual problems of: 1) encouraging biology students  to approach their discipline in terms of quantitative problem  solving and; 2) engaging applied mathematics students in devising  and solving mathematical problems which interface with the  sciences. The courses selected are populated by a wide range of  students: lower division, upper division, science major, and non-  science major. Through digital interfaces with microscopes and  physiological transducers, the selected biology courses yield  large interactive databases which are compliant to statistical  analysis. These data bases are incorporated into inquiry-based  undergraduate biology laboratory exercises which emphasize  statistical methods of analysis. In addition a mathematics  mentoring program is being established. The resultant exercises  and experiences are being disseminated to a large audience  through presentations, the Internet, publications, and commercial  distribution. Through this curriculum development project  undergraduate students learn why they need numerical data and how  to generate the necessary data.",
