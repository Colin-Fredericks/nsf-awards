 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of  11       undergraduate students each year in the Research Experiences       for Undergraduates program offered by Washington University       School of Medicine in St. Louis, MO.  Each student       participant will spend ten weeks engaged in developmental       biology research under the direction a faculty mentor of       his/her choice, selected from among ca. 40 faculty members       who have active, well-funded research programs and who study       developmental mechanisms in a wide variety of experimental       systems.  To permit students to view their research projects       in a broader context, five types of supplemental activities       will be provided: (i) a beginning-of-the-summer retreat at a       state park, where participants will meet with each other,       explore the issue of research ethics, and become introduced       to the study of developmental biology; (ii) workshops       dealing with important model organisms, methods, and       paradigms in contemporary developmental biology research;       (iii) faculty seminars designed specifically for the       students; (iv) participation in a student developmental       biology journal club; and (v) and end-of-the-summer research       symposium at which students will make presentations       summarizing their research accomplishments.  Opportunities       for frequent, informal social interactions will also be       provided.            This award will foster the continued education and  training of individuals who   will be part of the next generation  of basic researchers in the developmental biology.",
