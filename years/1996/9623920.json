 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623920  James  Dr. James' plans for integrating research and education are  presented.  The overall objective of her research is to  engineer a new polymeric material for the articulating  surfaces of total joint replacement implants which should  decrease the wear and thus increase the longevity of these  implants.    This award will support the experimental research and  development of novel gradient, interpenetrating polymer  network (IPN) materials with positively charged surfaces  which will have good bearing properties and will attract the  polyanionic lubricating molecules in synovial joint fluid.  Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) will be  made biomimetic by incorporating cationic groups, similar to  those in articular cartilage, into it.  Specifically, an IPN  will be formed at the surface of UHMWPE between crosslinked  polylysine (PL) and UHMWPE by swelling UHMWPE, diffusing PL  into it and subsequently crosslinking the PL.  The IPN will  have a gradient nature in which the surface regions have a  higher concentration of PL than the interior.  Variation of  swelling solvents, solvent temperature, PL oligomer size and  crosslinkers will result in IPNs with different gradient  thickness, characteristics and charge densities.    In order to characterize the mechanical and physical  properties of the novel materials, the following tests will  be performed:  conditioning, surface charge measurement,  measurement of the thickness and gradient characteristics,  dimensional changes from initial thickness, synovial fluid  adsorption and tribological characterization.  The results  of these tests will determine the most desirable  experimental methods to be used in the preparation of the  implant materials for the cell toxicity, mechanical testing  and hip simulator studies.    Dr. James tries to use cooperative learning in the classroom  and to integrate undergraduates in her research program  during the academic years and summers.  This proposal will  also help support the out reach activities of Dr. James and  her students, such as a snow sled design contest for girls  interested in math and science at regional public elementary  schools.  ***",
