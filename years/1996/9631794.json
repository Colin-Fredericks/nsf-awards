 "awd_abstract_narration": "9631794 Amato-Weirda  This Research Planning Grant addresses gas-phase chemistry of thermal and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition(CVD) of several metal nitrides.  Molecular beam mass spectrometry (MBMS) is being coupled to a fast-flow reactor in order to monitor in situ  and in real time gas-phase species and the kinetics of CVD reactions.  Various precursor systems will be investigated including homoleptic dialkylamido complexes of transition and main group metals  M(NR2)n  and ammonia, and more traditional systems such as metal halides(MX4) and ammonia. Thermal CVD studies will also investigate single-source precursors including Ti(NMe2)4 and Ti(NMe2)3(t-Bu) in the absence of ammonia, and  TiCl2(NHt-Bu)2(NHt-Bu)2 n. Gas-phase species and the kinetics of their formation will be determined as a function of reaction conditions: temperature, total and partial pressures of reactants, and residence time.  Additionally, films will be deposited simultaneously and gas-phase species correlated to film properties such as, growth rate, stoichiometry, and composition. %%% The understanding of gas-phase chemistry at the molecular level is crucial for future rational and significant improvement in materials synthesis by chemical vapor deposition(CVD). More importantly the exploration of CVD gas-phase chemistry and kinetics is necessary for the development of general reaction modeling, as well as understanding the relationships among precursor systems, reactivity patterns, and final film properties.  While this project will focus primarily on the study of kinetics and mechanisms of reactions, it will also contribute to a greater general understanding of nitrides materials synthesis and processing issues.  The planning grant will aid the PI in accomplishing enough preliminary work to show the promise of ideas or to modify them based on the data acquired.  Thus, support during the planning period will aid the PI in preparing a more competitive full proposal. ***",
