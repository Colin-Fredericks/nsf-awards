The research explores and creates a mathematical computational tool which when used with Life Cycle Analysis provides a quantitative Impact Improvement Analysis. A quantitative state space model of industrial products or processes will be created. The model, as a discrete finite Markov chain, will predict the impact of a proposed design decision and optimize that decision for its impact upon both sustainable development and the environment on the firm and its industry. Using time history data, a multivariate data dependent system (DDS) will be developed to further refine the analysis so that decision makers can order their decisions to have the least disruptive effect upon their operations. The research tools will be made available on the World Wide Web.        If successful, this research will provide to industry tools to allow decision makers to apply Environmental Life Cycle Analysis at the facility level. Currently these tools do not exist and restrict or prevent decision makers from taking advantage of Life Cycle Analysis in planning both products and processes. Among these tools is an effective means to compute the anticipated changes in materials on a facility due to the attempt to meet specified environmental goals for material reduction and prevention of pollution. Additionally, these tools provide a dynamic, time structured, analysis of the effects of incremental decisions. This is enhanced by the ability to compare and optimize decisions to meet industrial competitive objectives. This research extends Life Cycle Analysis to allow manufacturers to better quantify their inventories and to provide pathways to reducing material usage where desired.    ***",
