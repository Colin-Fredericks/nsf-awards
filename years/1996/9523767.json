Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute  New Techniques for Audio, Image, and Video Compression    The goal of this research is to investigate more effective  techniques for digital audio, image, and video data compression.   For audio, the intention is to employ more efficient  entropy-constrained, conditional and unconditional, quantization in  the coding of the critical subbands of the MPEG audio standard.   The dependence of the subbands is next exploited using set  partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) as done originally in   embedded, wavelet, zerotree coding of images.  The resulting  embedded coding allows delivery of different qualities of service  with a single compressed bit stream.  A newly developed SPIHT  procedure, which obtained probably the best-to-date monochrome,   still image results (lossy or lossless) and with extremely fast  encoding and decoding, is utilized for audio and also for color  image and video coding.  The extremely fast execution of the SPIHT  coding procedure makes it especially suitable for video, where a  requirement of real-time coding becomes an insurmountable obstacle  for other procedures. Both lossy and lossless coding are  investigated, as they fit naturally into the SPIHT framework.  It is expected that the results will surpass those of existing  standard systems, which do not produce naturally embedded code, and  are far more complex operationally and hence slower in execution.   Other investigations involve the use of information theoretic  criteria to create optimal adaptive subband compositions and the  use of trellis coded quantization (TCQ) in block discrete cosine  transform (DCT) and lapped orthogonal transform (LOT) coding.  The  adaptive subband decompositions pay off in better compression for  a given subband coding technique.  TCQ coding brings an efficient,  but complex technique operating on transform blocks, which preserve  regional characteristics of the image.  Finally, the SPIHT coding  algorithm pr ovokes several theoretical questions which are  addressed. Among them are the minimal information rates to  determine octave ranges of random variables and convey subset  partition numbers and element numbers, and the mutual information  between significant bits of dependent random variables and between  their respective residual bits.  Satisfactory answers to these  questions will lead to more efficient coding techniques with  decreased complexity.",
