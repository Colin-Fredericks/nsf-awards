Let me know if you have any comments and would like me to   revise the second paragraph.     The revised budget of $20.5K for each of three years has been   signed on Friday by Richard Hasbrook, Iowa State University representative.   I will fax you the forms this coming Monday.     Have a nice weekend.    Regards,    Suncica                             ABSTRACT OF THE PROJECT     \"Nonlinear Wave Interactions in One and Two Space Dimensions\"              Suncica Canic, Iowa State University, Ames           This project deals with nonlinear wave interactions in one and two space   dimensions. The main focus is on wave interactions that arise in transonic   flow, reflections of a shock by a wedge, multiphase flow through the porous   media and chemically reactive fluids. A benchmark problem for understanding   the interaction of nonlinear waves in two-space dimensions is the shock   reflection problem. Depending on the shock strength and the wedge angle   different reflection patterns can occur. Open problems regard the transition   criteria between different types of reflection, bifurcation diagram   describing two-dimensional elementary waves, and the existence theory  that would provide a solution space describing possible singularities.   This research project proposes a study of self-similar wave interactions  in two space dimensions as a first step towards understanding these issues.    The study is based on the nonlinear analysis of free-boundary problems for   transonic shock waves, on the wave curve analysis of quasi-one-dimensional   Riemann problems that arise in hyperbolic wave interactions, and on   numerical simulations of the corresponding wave structures. The results from   t his project would provide a fundamental contribution towards understanding   the nonlinear stability  of transonic shock waves and the development of a   general theory of two-dimensional wave interactions.      In one-dimensional systems of conservation laws, global existence and   uniqueness of weak solutions is still an open question. A delicate dependence   of weak solutions on the precise form of diffusion plays a crucial role in   distinguishing  physically relevant solutions (in oil reservoir modeling,   chemically reactive fluids, elastic plastic deformation, and in numerical   simulations). In this project an organized approach to the study of the   influence of the precise form of viscosity on the existence and uniqueness   of weak solutions has been proposed. Preliminary results surprisingly   indicate symmetry breaking solutions for some parabolic conservation laws.            Mathematical issues studied in this project derive from applications   such as high-performance computing simulations in oil recovery, and the   stability of transonic flow. In both applications (nonlinear) waves arise   naturally (e.g., propagation of an interface between water and oil   in oil reservoir simulations, formation and propagation of shock waves   around a wing in a supersonic flight, formation and interaction of waves in a   converging-diverging nozzle). Numerical methods used in computer   simulations of these phenomena are sensitive to certain parameters. For   example, numerical schemes that produce artificial (non-physical) diffusion   may produce misleading answers that may result in high production costs.   Therefore, understanding the dependence of solutions on the parameters in   a problem (called the stability of solutions) is crucial in devising efficient   numerical methods that would produce physically meaningful solutions.   This project focuses of the stability of nonlinear waves that   arise in a large class of models used in many areas of Federal  strategic interests. Two such appl ications are described above. Because   of the complexity of the problem, various state-of-the-art theoretical   techniques (e.g., nonlinear analysis of free-boundary problems, dynamical   systems approach to the influence of diffusion on weak Riemann solutions)   coupled with computer simulations, need to be used to tackle the problem.   Preliminary results indicate new phenomena that have not been studied before   (e.g., the occurrence of singularities in transonic flow and symmetry   breaking solutions in oil recovery). These results are crucial   in tailoring computer codes to capture the (\"correct\") physical behavior.",
