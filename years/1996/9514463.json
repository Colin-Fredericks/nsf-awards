 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514463     Frye      The classical mechanism of action of steroid hormones is for the  hormone to diffuse through the plasma membrane, bind to a cytosolic  receptor which is translocated to the nucleus of the cell, where  the receptor/ligand complex induces changes in gene transcription,  and subsequently protein production.  However, it has been observed  that some behavioral effects of these hormones take place quite  rapidly when compared to the hours required to change protein  synthesis in a cell.  As a result, the current theory of steroid  action includes the ability of these hormones to exert rapid,  non-genomic effects, possibly involving receptors imbedded in the  plasma membrane.  The investigations of Dr. Frye focus on the  non-genomic behavioral effects of steroid hormones.  A study of the  ability of steroid hormones to modulate classical  gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors and reproductive behavior is an  integral part of this project.  In addition, the behavioral effects  of steroid hormones produced by the brain,  will be undertaken.   The notion that non-genomic effects of steroids complement genomic  effects of these hormones to initiate and terminate reproductive  behavior is unique and will provide essential new information in  the study of the brain communication mechanisms.  Additionally, the  evidence supporting novel, non-classical effects of steroid  hormones will be important for biologists investigating the  neurobiology and physiology of this essential class of molecules  that are used by organisms in many ways.  In addition to the novel  research to be undertaken during this research, Dr. Frye will also  engage in novel educational activities crucial to the development  of new programs at Connecticut College. The development of a new  curriculum in neuroscience and biopsychology incorporating novel  research experiences for undergraduate students is a centerpiece of  Dr. Frye's activities, as well as developing new outreach  activities.  Support for this research an d education program will  have great importance on the development of future generations of  neuroendocrinologists and neuroscientists from both an educational  and research perspective.",
