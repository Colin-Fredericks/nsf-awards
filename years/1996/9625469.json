 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  EEC-9625469    There is an increasing need for integrated industrial relevant research addressing building interior environments and energy efficiency.  The United States has been among the leaders in research in these areas but has lagged behind Europe and Japan in the implementation of the research results.  This planning grant will provide funding for a planning meeting to determine if companies will support the research program and the viability of a Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for the Built-Environment at the University of California, Berkeley.    The research proposed for industry's consideration at the planning meeting will address: 1) Laboratory and Field Studies of Task/Ambient Conditioning (TAC) Systems, 2) Development of Field Methods to Evaluate Indoor Environmental Quality, 3) Development of an Advanced Human Thermal Comfort Model, 4) Design Tool for Thermal Assessment of the Local Environment (DTALE), 5) Took Kits for Improving Building Operation and Energy Performance, 6) Development of Improved Software for Thermal Analysts of Windows and Construction Assemblies.      The Principal Investigator and his colleagues are nationally recognized researchers in their fields and are eminently qualified to administrate this planning meeting.",
