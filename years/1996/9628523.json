 "awd_abstract_narration": "Paul Barbara is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his theoretical and   experimental research directed at understanding quantum chemical dynamics   in solution. Using femtosecond pump-probe optical spectroscopy as an   experimental tool Barbara will study: 1) electronically nonadiabatic   transitions in symmetric and asymmetric metal-metal intervalence   compounds; 2) electronically nonadiabatic transitions in the one and two   photon ionization of aqueous iodide solution and the two photon   ionization of water; 3) vibrationally nonadiabatic transitions in the   photodissociation, recombination, and the vibrational relaxation of small   strongly solvated radicals with high frequency vibrations; and 4) the   putative long-range coherent electron transfer between   metallointercalators in DNA.  Theoretical studies are also proposed of   current quantum theoretical models for electron transfer and vibrational   relaxation.  Since many commercially important chemical reactions take place in polar   solvents such as water, it is important to understand the influence which   such solvents have on the reaction dynamics.  A number of effects, such   as solvent cage effects,  vibrational relaxation and quantum mechanical   tunneling, which     are not present in the gas phase completely dominate   condensed phase chemical reactions.  It is important to develop reliable   theories for model chemical systems which can then be applied to   improving the efficiency of commercially important chemical reactions.    The work which is being performed by Barbara provides an important   experimental basis for the development of such theories.",
