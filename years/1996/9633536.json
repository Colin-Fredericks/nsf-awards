 "awd_abstract_narration": "Real-time systems are becoming increasingly important to everyday  life. Examples include command and control systems, process  control systems, telecommunication systems, patient monitoring  systems, flight control systems, robotics, avionics systems, and  so on. With increasing computing power and high demand for  multimedia applications, larger and more complex real-time  systems are being continuously developed. However, the  development of real-time systems is difficult and takes longer  time than the development of a system without real-time  constraints, and a significant portion of the entire effort  remains devoted to the maintenance activities of the software  life cycle.    The concept of software architecture has recently emerged as a  new way to improve our ability to effectively construct large-  scale software systems. In spite of many attempts to develop  architecture specification languages, this area still lacks a  solid formal foundation. Without a solid foundation, it is  difficult to develop and apply rigorous analysis methods to  assure the correctness of real-time software systems as well as  to analyze the impacts of changes on various system properties  such as safety, consistency, and reliability.    This research seeks to develop a formal foundation for an  architecture specification language using the integration of  non-monotonic logic and temporal logic. The syntax of the  language is based on the concepts of object, frames  and  production rules. This allows developers to easily describe the  attributes and constraints of each software component, and also  the hierarchical relations among the software components in the  software architecture.    The goal is to localize changes to software components in the low-  level architecture specification and avoid modifying the high-  level architecture specification. The semantics of multiple  inheritance and exception handling will be established using a  non-monotonic logic. Based on the formal foundation of the  architec ture specification language, it is expected that new  possiblities will exist for analyzing software properties such as  liveness, safety, consistency, and temporal constraints. This  foundation is also expected to provide a basis for analyzing the  impact of changes to a real-time software system.  ***",
