 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research of a cultural anthropologist studying the process of women's aging in the Middle East.  The aim of the project is to measure the prevalence and determinants of menopausal symptoms, and to investigate patterns of health care use among women in Casablanca, Morocco and Beirut, Lebanon.  The perceptions and meanings of menopause among women and health professionals will be studied as well as government policies which affect the definition and management of the condition in the two countries.  Methods will include in depth interviews with a sample of women to design an appropriate survey questionnaire, which will be administered to a random sample of 300 women in each country.  The aim will be to measure the discomfort and incapacitation experienced by the women as well as the factors which influence the symptoms, their reasons for seeking both biomedical and traditional health care, as well as their general notions of reproduction, aging, and health.  Interviews and observations will also be carried out in doctors' offices.  This research is important because it will advance our understanding of this condition of aging which affects an increasing proportion of society's population given the fact that people in many societies are living longer.  The regional comparison will suggest rich hypotheses for studying what part of menopause is culturally conditioned and what part biologically given.  The study seeks to understand the multiple meanings of menopause, explore the forces that shape the extent to which it is medicalized, and gain insight into underlying ideas about health, gender and aging across these two societies and ultimately, to advance theory covering the world's population.",
