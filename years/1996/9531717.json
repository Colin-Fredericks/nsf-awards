 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to Furman University for an REU Site which offers students research experiences in psychology.  Eight students each year, over a three year period, will be selected for ten-week sessions in the summer.  The focus of the research program is information processing.  Students will pursue research in the areas of learning, memory, and cognition.  Five faculty directors representing distinct perspectives in psychology (biological, comparative, cognitive, developmental, and social) will collaborate with the students.  Each student will be responsible for a specific, unique research project.  Project activities will insure that each student conducts meaningful research and learns not just about his or her own project, but also about the integrated nature of behavioral science.  The interdisciplinary nature of research will be a focus of the Site.  Other activities will include instruction on computer skills and data analysis, written and oral presentations, and weekly group meetings to present issues and help students appreciate the interrelationship of the various projects..  This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.",
