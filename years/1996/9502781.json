Piers and M. E. Gouvea of the  Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais to perform theoretical  and computational analyses of the properties of topological  nonlinear excitations in quasi-two-dimensional magnets.  The  research will extend the current understanding of the  properties of the vortex, soliton, and spinwave excitations  in these systems.  The magnetic properties of topological  excitations will be determined partly by perturbation theory  from exactly known solutions, and partly by numerical  simulations.    The proposed studies will provide a better understanding of  the particular spin structures that make up the topological  excitations in two-dimensional magnets, as well as determine  the internal normal modes of the excitations.  An important  contribution will be the characterization of the role of  topological excitations in the phase transitions in such  magnets.  While topological defects have been shown to be  significant factors in phase transitions in superfluids and  superconductors, in liquid crystals, and in other physical  systems, the proposed work will carry the investigation of  these effects to easy-plane and easy-axis two-dimensional  magnets.  The Brazilian group brings experience in the  analytical study of such properties, while the U.S. group  has experience in computer simulation of the same class of  properties.  ***",
