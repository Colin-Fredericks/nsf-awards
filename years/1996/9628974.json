 "awd_abstract_narration": "9628974  Zumberge    This grant provides $53,209 as partial support of  investigator salaries and the costs of computing  equipment to be used in an absolute gravity  resurvey of sites in California together with  testing of a new fringe-signal processing  technique.  Specifically, surveys and instrument  calibrations will be made at 7 sites using a new  Micro-g solutions Model FG5 absolute gravity meter  together with an older IGPP-AGM-1 instrument which  was used at these sites six years ago.  The newer  instrument provides approximately five times  greater sensitivity in the measurement of local  acceleration of gravity.  The comparison between  measurements using both instruments is important  for calibration of the newer instrument in order  to monitor secular changes in vertical tectonic  displacements at these sites.  Without such a  calibration study, the older measurements would be  lost as a baseline with the retirement of the IGPP-  AGM-1.  Resurvey of these sites is timely as  sufficient time has passed so that the centimeter  scale vertical resolution possible with absolute  gravimetry will allow significant determination of  rates of vertical crustal deformation in this  tectonically active region of the world.  Of  particular interest, these measurements, when made  in conjunction with GPS or satellite laser ranging  (SLR) as independent measures of vertical  displacement, should yield insight into the  mechanisms responsible for deformation.  Historical SLR measurements exist for two of the  proposed resurvey sites, namely, Quincy and  Monument Peak.  ***",
