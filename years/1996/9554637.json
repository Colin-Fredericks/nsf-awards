 "awd_abstract_narration": "Radford University will host a five-day conference for  approximately 55-60 college biology teachers.  The focus is  introductory biology courses for majors and non-majors.  The  primary objectives of the conference are threefold.  First, it will  serve as a forum for presenting curricular innovations in biology  teaching, including the ones developed with NSF support at Radford  University. Participants will have extended opportunities to  explore these new approaches through hands-on workshops, group  discussions, and critiques.  As a result, the conference will  promote adaptation and adoption of model activities that have  proven successful at various colleges and universities around the  country.  Second, the conference will provide a forum for  participants to share their own laboratory and classroom  activities.  This will be accomplished through poster sessions,  group discussions, and collaborative work sessions.  Finally, the  conference will provide a vehicle for establishing and  strengthening informal information networks linking committed  biology teachers throughout the country.  Using conference  activities as a springboard, participants will contribute to a  volume of new teaching materials.  This informal publication will  be distributed to all conference participants and other interested  biology teachers.",
