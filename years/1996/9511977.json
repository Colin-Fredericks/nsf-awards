 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs propose to examine the apparent discrepancy between the pro-environmental   attitudes that people express and the less than pro-environmental behaviors that people   perform.  The PIs propose to perform four  streams  of experiments to examine this   issue.  In the first stream of experiments the PIs will examine preference reversals in   environmental domains.  The hypothesis is that when persons evaluate a single option,   they tend to focus on what they want rather than what they think they should do.  When   choosing between two or more options, people switch their mode of decision making   toward what they perceive they should do.  In the second stream of experimentation, the   PIs will explore the self-enhancement biases that allow people to escape blame from   behaving in ways that are detrimental to the environment.  In the third stream of studies   the PIs will explore egocentrism in the arena of environmental decision making.  By   interpreting information in a self-serving manner, persons can act in an exploitative way   toward the environment and toward each other and still feel that they have behaved   appropriately.  Finally the PIs will explore the area of generation discounting--the means   by which people evaluate the relative importance of their current consumption relative to   the welfare of subsequent generations.",
