 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507757  Lazear    This project continues the development and implementation of a  jobs-based analysis of labor markets and starts a new human  capital related research agenda on the acquisition of culture and  language skills.  The entire notion of a  job,  which seems  central to the thinking of businesspersons and administrators, is  virtually absent from most labor market analyses.  The  institutional literature, and especially the work on internal  labor markets, asks questions that differ from those asked by  human capital theory.  This is a proposal to consider these  questions and to provide answers to them based on new data sets,   which will be collected as part of the project.  A few of these  questions are:  What is the meaningful definition of a  job  and when should the     job category be defined narrowly and when broadly?     What theory explains how workers move from one job to another?     How are job categories determined in the organization?     How much of wage growth over a worker s career depends on     promotion from one job to another and how much is accounted     for by within-job wage growth?     Do jobs (as opposed to workers in them) display different     turnover behavior?  Are there  ports of entry  into the firm?      Are there dead-end jobs?    The research on the acquisition of culture and language skills is  based on the premise that common culture and common language  facilitate trade between individuals.  Minorities have incentives  to become assimilated and to learn the majority language so that   they have a larger pool of potential trading partners.  The value  of assimilation is larger to an individual from a small minority   than to one from a large minority group.  When a society has a  very large majority of individuals from one culture, individuals   from minority groups will be assimilated more quickly.   Assimilation is less likely when an immigrant s native culture  and language is broadly represented in his new country.  Also,  when governments pr otect minority interests directly, incentives   to be assimilated into the majority culture are reduced.  The  theory is developed and tested by examining U.S. Census data on  the relationship between the likelihood that an immigrant will  learn English and the proportion of the local population that  speaks his or her native language.",
