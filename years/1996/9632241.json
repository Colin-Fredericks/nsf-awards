 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will create increased science opportunities for girls  ages 6-11 by piloting a hands-on science/gender equity model in  after school programs at four New York City settlement houses, and  by creating a Program Handbook for dissemination through United  Neighborhood Houses (UNH) and United Neighborhood Centers of  America (UNCA).  The model will be developed for both single-sex  and co-ed settings, and will include staff training, youth  activities, and a parent involvement component.  This project will  build on the proven success of Educational Equity Concept's  \"Playtime is Science\" program, with two important innovations:  an  increase focus specifically on improving results for girls, and a  new setting, i.e. community-based after-school sites instead of  public schools.    Specific objectives are:  a) to increase the amount of hands-on  science offered to girls ages 6-11 in settlement houses from none  to at least two hours per week; b) to develop both single-sex and  coed models for carrying out hands-on science with a gender equity  focus; c) to train staff in settlement houses in both hands-on  physical science and in gender equity; d) to involve parents of  participating girls in hands-on science and gender equity  activities; e) to give settlement house staff the training they  need to institutionalize the model program so that it will continue  beyond the grant period; f) to evaluate the success of the model;  g) to develop a Program Handbook; and h) to work in partnership  with UNH in New York City and UNCA nationally to disseminate the  model and materials.",
