 "awd_abstract_narration": "9634036  Georgiou  This proposal is on research to improve the production  of correctly folded complex eucaryotic protein in E.  coli.  It is proposed to employ thrombolytic enzyme  tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) as the model protein  for optimizing the expression of secreted  multidisulfide proteins in bacteria.  It is expected  that conditions which maximize the formation of the  correct disulfide bonds in tPA will also be useful for  the expression of simpler proteins with fewer disulfide  bonds.  A three part strategy is proposed.  This  includes: (1) Cellular Engineering:  This approach  utilizes a recent discovery by the investigators that  the mammalian protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) can be  expressed in a functional form in E. coli where it can  mediate the expression of low, but significant, amounts  of active tPA.  Conditions that enhance the activity of  PDI in the bacterial periplasmic space, and thus result  in increased yields of correctly folded tPA, will be  determined. (2) Genetic Screening:  The use of genetic  screens to isolate mutants producing high amounts of  correctly folded tPA will be employed since disulfide  bond formation is a complex process that may prove  difficult to optimize solely by cell engineering  approaches.  Mutants exhibiting the highest titer of  active tPA will be isolated and characterized to  determine the genetic lesions that result in more  efficient disulfide bond formation.  (3) Fermentation  Engineering:  A systematic study of the effect of  fermentation conditions which are known to have an  influence on tPA folding will be conducted.  These  include parameters such as dissolved oxygen  concentration, the redox potential of the growth  medium, the presence of low molecular weight thiols and  disulfides and culture pH.  The in vivo oxygen states  of the enzymes that catalyze disulfide bond formation  will be determined so that the effect of growth  conditions on function of the disulfide machinery can  be understood.  Also, fermentation c onditions that  maximize cell density while maintaining the optimal  oxidation state for heterologous protein folding will  be investigated.  This research is a cooperative  activity with Genentech Inc. in South San Francisco,  California.  Genentech will commit significant  resources including scientists' time fermentation  equipment, expression vectors, antibodies, analytical  support, tPA samples etc. towards the completion of  this research.  ***",
