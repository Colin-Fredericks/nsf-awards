 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Xin    The first part of the  proposed research concerns the global existence and asymptotics of   front solutions to the two-dimensional Boussinesq combustion  system on finite and infinite vertical strips with unbounded chemical  nonlinearities, and arbitrary Lewis, Prandtl and Rayleigh numbers.  Numerical methods will be implemented for calculating front speeds and  controling chaotic flame fronts.  The second part concerns the stability, instability of vortex  solutions to Ginzburg-Landau equations and related  asymptotic analysis. The third part  concerns the dimensional bounds of  the universal attractors, qualitative properties of solutions,  approximation using reduced equations (such as Swift-Hohenberg like equations), and numerical simulation of the Maxwell-Bloch  two level laser systems.    The above proposed works are based on problems arising in  dynamics of reacting flows, and lasers.  Understanding reacting flows is of tremendous practical importance,  and is related to industrial chemical processing, energy consumption,  as well as biotechnological remediation of environment.  In designing internal combustion engines or conducting industrial  chemical processes, one of the immediate concerns is to increase the efficiency of fuel burning, and so minimize the waste gas output  and reduce air pollution. It is known that well-mixed and strongly stirred reacting fluids have more effective contact area and their  reaction efficiency is much higher. On the other hand,  stirred fluids behave in an irregular and chaotic manner, and are not easy to control.  This motivates us to study the properties of  the irregular reacting flows in order to utilize them for our needs.        Mathematical models proposed here serve as a starting  point for pursuing such an investigation where both analytical and  numerical methods can be applied to advance our understanding.  Moreover, the techniques we develop can be very useful to other problems, such as bioremediation of polluted aquifer.  T here similar irregular or chaotic phenomena  exist due to the interaction of chemical species with bacteria  growth. Chaotic phenomena also appear in optical systems where  people try to produce high power laser output for  massively parallel optical computing and processing, image storage,  and high power energy sources. It is essential to be able to  achieve coherence and control of the laser output. Mathematically,  this amounts to studying stability and instability of  the special solutions of the laser system, analyzing the structures and finding good approximations of attractors. The two level laser  model we propose here is the first step towards this goal.   The progress made and the methodology developed in the systematic   study of the two level model will  greatly help us approach more complicated yet more appealing  semiconductor laser systems  in the future.",
