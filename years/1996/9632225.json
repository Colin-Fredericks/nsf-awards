 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  project  develops methods to scale data mining tasks to large, inherently distributed databases. Meta-learning  computes  base  classifiers  by  applying learning  programs in parallel to database partitions, and then integrates them by another learning process outputting a `meta-classifier`.  Meta-learning  the correlations  of  the  base  classifiers  boosts  overall  predictive accuracy. Efficiency is achieved by parallel  processing  and  reduced  serial  time  per learning  process.  Meta-learning  is  scalable  by data reduction and parallel processing in hierarchical organizations.  We explore, analyze and  validate  a  number  of  approaches  to  meta-learning,  and  deliver  demonstrable  systems allowing other researchers to directly utilize our results.  We  develop  field tests  of  the  resultant  technology  by  launching `learning agents` over the internet and combine their  collective  knowledge  by  `meta-learning  agents`. Many  defense  and  commercial  applications  will  benefit  from  learning new knowledge by integrating and analyzing very large amounts of widely distributed data. One organization working collaboratively on this project is the Financial Services Technology Consortium.  The FSTC has defined a  realistic  application  amenable  to  meta-learning  techniques  and  are  providing  real datasets and learning tasks.  The project participants will demonstrate the efficacy of  the proposed  approach for fraud detection of electronic transactions in electronic commerce applications of the internet.",
