 "awd_abstract_narration": "9528391  Mayer    This collaborative multidisciplinary research project  addresses metallization and contact formation in silicon-  based systems: investigation of the properties of Ag films  as interconnecting metallization in comparison with Cu, and  silicide formation for shallow contacts to Si on  insulator(SOI) structures.  The objective is to investigate  the fundamental properties of Ag-based formation of self-  passivating layers, adhesion, and diffusion barriers  utilizing refractory metal additions in comparison with an  extensive series of investigations of Cu metallization with  Ti addition conducted previously.  Silicide formation on Si  on insulator(SOI) structures has stringent materials  requirements for the self-aligned-silicide(SALICIDE)  technology, and the objective of this study is to  investigate the CoSix(x>1)/Ti system to bypass the formation  CoSi, thus reducing void formation, to investigate the use  of Pd rather than Ti as an interposing thin layer to form  epitaxial CoSi2 layers, and to investigate the stress in  thinner layers of the Si epi-layers in the SOI structure.  Transmission electron microscopy, ion beam analysis(RBS and  channeling), and electrical diagnostics will all be employed  routinely to characterize films and structures synthesized  and fabricated during the course of the research.  %%%  The proposed basic investigations of metallization and  contact formation are expected to contribute basic materials  science knowledge of technological relevance to advanced  microelectronic devices and circuits.  The knowledge and  understanding gained from this research project is expected  to contribute in a general way to improving the performance  of advanced devices and circuits used in computing,  information processing, and telecommunications by providing  a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and  producing improved materials.  An important feature of the  program is the integration of research and education through  the training of st udents in a fundamentally and  technologically significant area.  ***",
