 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:  The Center for High-Pressure Research (CHiPR) at SUNY Stony Brook will establish a Summer program to give undergraduates the opportunity to participate in the excitement of a premier science laboratory.  The goal is to recruit students from the physical sciences and stimulate them to pursue a research career in the Earth Sciences.  Students will work with faculty of the Mineral Physics Institute (MPI) on projects that probe the physical and chemical properties of materials, with a particular emphasis on use of high pressure.  Working closely with members of the MPI, students will pursue their own projects and discuss their progress during weekly seminars.  During the program, students will visit other laboratories and institutions affiliated with the MPI.  CHiPR has established a good record of recruiting and retaining minority students by relying on personal contacts, especially with faculty at historically minority colleges and universities.  The best example of this is recruiting by a black faculty member at an historically black university who received his Ph.D. through the MPI and continues to work there during the summers.  The close mentoring he can offer his students is a key to their success.",
