This grant, which is supported  under the GOALI initiative, is a collaborative effort  between researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and  DuPont.  It is planned to use precise and well characterized  variations in sample composition to  correlate electronic  structure, charge density, dielectric properties, and  optical properties.  The principal experimental research  tools proposed are scanning tunneling and optical  spectroscopies along with  more standard characterization  methods (SIMS, RBS, EDS, etc.).  A major goal of the project  is to achieve sufficient fundamental knowledge to develop a  model relating local bonding to properties in multicomponent  systems.  %%%  An  important feature of the program is the integration of  research and education by provision of an invaluable  opportunity for students to conduct fundamental materials  science research in both University and  Industrial research  environments.  The students will receive joint mentoring by  Prof.Bonnell/University of  Pennsylvania, and Dr.  French/DuPont.  A computer network connection will be  established to allow experimental data and modeling at  either location to be accessed at the other; the network  will also include a bulletin board for information exchange.  The project represents a strong research alliance between  academia and industry, and at the same time provides an  attractive arrangement for integration of education and  research through the training of students in a fundamentally  and technologically significant area.  ***",
