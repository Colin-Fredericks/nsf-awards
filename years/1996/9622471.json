This includes the time-frequency correlation for pulse, spatial interference for angular and polarization correlations, and coherent interference for backscattering.  The PI's present systems are inadequate for present and future needs because of limited signal to noise ratio, unavailability of key components, and lack of modulation capability in the optical systems. The requested equipment,  a general purpose wideband microwave amplifier, microwave components and an optical EO amplitude modulator, will remove these restraints and will great enhance the PI's NSF sponsored research effort in remote sensing.  Especially the optical EO modulator is essential for converting the present system for space-time interferometry.  Several projects will utilize the enhanced experimental capability: (i) ultrawideband scattering by random media (ii) angular polarization correlations and imaging of objects in random media (iii) enhanced backscattering and resonant location and (iv) characterization of composite materials.  The equipment will also be used by several multidisciplinary research groups in collaboration with the Electromagnetic and Remote Sensing Laboratory, which has 6 faculty members and more than 20 graduate students.",
