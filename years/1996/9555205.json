 "awd_abstract_narration": "A series of  computer modules will be developed to simulate the physical, chemical, and biological processes active in Earth systems in ways not possible with traditional instructional methods.  These computer models not only will supplement classroom instruction, they will  help students visualize  dynamic processes that occur over geologic time, three dimensional structures,  and geologic phenomena  on scales  ranging from \"microns to mountains\".  The goals of this multi-media project are to develop curriculum materials that: 1) focus on the physical, chemical, and biological processes at work in  Earth systems, 2) incorporate multiple learning approaches (hands-on activities, visual aids, three dimensional models, and simulations of systems),  and 3) contain relevant and integrative problem solving . These  materials will be part of an integrated  curriculum package in which the computer modules will enhance the learning process.   This project is a collaborative effort  sponsored by the American Geophysical Union, with field testing of the materials at the University of Arizona, Glendale Community College,  and other institutional settings.  The project  will affect  2000 liberal arts and education majors per year at these institutions.  A primary focus of this project will be the development of new instructional materials that will  provide future teachers with a solid knowledge base as well as an appreciation  for the conduct of scientific inquiry.  A CD-ROM of the  computer exercises, laboratory manual,  and  instructor's manual will be developed for national dissemination.",
