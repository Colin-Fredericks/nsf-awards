 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thakur  9623187  The investigator will explore analogies between Number Theory and  Geometry.  The hypergeometric function is one of the most  important special functions in mathematics and mathematical  physics.  Many of the functions that arise in various branches of  mathematics and physics-Bessel, Legendre, and Jacobi functions,  and many interesting orthogonal polynomials-are special cases of   the hypergeometric function.  Similarly, the q-hypergeometric  functions arise in the study of mathematical physics.  The  investigator has introduced an analogue for function fields, and  he will develop their theory and applications.  A classical  problem in Number Theory is to understand the nature of the  values of the Riemann zeta-function.  Euler showed that the   values at even integers s are rational multiples of powers of pi.  For odd s, the only known result is that the zeta-function is  irrational at s=3.  Carlitz considered an analogue of the  zeta-function by taking a sum over monic polynomials with  coefficients in finite fields, and established an analogue  of  Euler's result.  In the joint work with Anderson, the PI showed  that for  any positiveminteger s, the values are logarithms of  algebraic numbers, and are therefore transcendental.  It was also  shown that the analogue of Euler's  result for odd s does not  hold in this case.  The proposer plans to generalize thismresult  to general function fields.  The order of vanishing of zeta   functions gives important arithmetic information.  The PI plans  to complete  new partial results that he has obtained about these  orders. Also, the PI  plans to workmout the relations of special  values with the cyclotomic theory, in light of recent work of  Anderson.  The special values of the classical gamma function  have also been extensively studied.  The PI introduced a new   gamma function for function fields.  He has established special  values results for its interpolations at finite primes for  general function fields and for interpolati on at the infinite  prime only for the rational function field.  He plans to settle  the remaining case.  This research falls into the general  mathematical field of Number Theory.  Number theory has its  historical roots in the study of the whole numbers, addressing  such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one   whole number by another.  It is among the oldest branches of  mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely  aesthetic reasons. However, within  the last half century it has  become an indispensable tool in diverse applications in areas  such as data transmission and processing, and communication  systems.",
