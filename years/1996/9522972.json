 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year awards will support U.S.-U.K. cooperative research in physiology between John Trotter of the University of New Mexico and Karl Kadler of the Wellcome Trust Cell Matrix Unit at the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom.  Other co-investigators at the University of Manchester are David Holmes and John Chapman.  The objective of the research is to determine the molecular structure and formation of echinoderm collagen fibrils.  The U.S. investigator, through NSF-supported research, has determined the shape and molecular structure of echinoderm fibrils.  In cooperation with colelagues in the United Kingdom, he will analyze the mass distribution of whole collagen fibrils from three different species and determine the molecular mechanism of fibril growth.   The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration knowledge and expertise in biochemistry and in methods for isolating native collagen fibrils from echinoderms.  This is complemented by the British investigators' expertise in biophysics and in the analysis of molecular mass distributions in collagen fibrils using scanning transmission electron microscopy with computerized image analysis.  The results will advance our knowledge of fibril structure in echinoderms and invertebrates.  The collaboration may lay the ground work for synthetic novel biomaterials based on collagen fibrils, which strengthen  when its structure is deformed.",
