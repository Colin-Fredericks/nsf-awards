 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Faculty Resource Network--a 28 member award-winning consortium  which links fourteen liberal arts colleges in the Northeast, twelve  historically black colleges and universities in the South, and one  predominantly minority institution in the Midwest with New York  University-proposes to build on its decade of experience in  improving undergraduate teaching by initiating an intensive  three-year faculty enrichment program focusing on the teaching of  introductory and advanced undergraduate courses in molecular and  cellular biology and the development of innovative laboratory  techniques.  Two summer residential workshops form the centerpiece  of the program.  The first, in 1996, will focus on introductory  molecular biology courses and the second, in 1997, on advanced  molecular biology courses.  The workshops will introduce faculty to  the latest methods and techniques of molecular biology and explore  new means of teaching biology that incorporate innovative hands-on  and inquiry-based methods.  At the conclusion of each of the  workshop sessions, participants will have produced a curricular  packet, which includes summaries of major lecture themes,  laboratory experiments, relevant bibliographical materials, and  teaching strategies, for direct classroom application.  During the  academic years following each summer workshop, a series of local  campus-based colloquia at the home institutions will be held.   Workshop participants, who will have tested and refined the  material developed during their summer study, will lead these  colloquia, and will have an opportunity to share their new  knowledge and teaching techniques with colleagues.  Publications  summarizing these conclusions on curricular and pedagogical methods  will be published and distributed to the 600 Network faculty  members teaching in the sciences, together with faculty members of  other colleges and universities linked to the Network through the  Leadership Alliance and CCTOP, a tri-state community college  consortium.   In Summer 1998, the program will conclude with a  three-day conference held at Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia.   At the this concluding event, program participants will make  presentations on the refined curricular and pedagogical innovations  they have tested in their classrooms to an audience of scientists  from Network institutions and beyond.  Undergraduate Faculty  Enhancement in Teaching Molecular and Cellular Biology will be of  particular interest to biologists, but it will also benefit other  science faculty whose work involves an aspect of molecular biology,  as well as those who are interested in effective and innovative  teaching strategies in the sciences.  By introducing faculty to new  and important areas of the life sciences and by emphasizing  different pedagogical applications, the program will improve the  quality of learning for the 80,000 students on Network college  campuses.",
