 "awd_abstract_narration": "The original World-Wide Web (WWW) architecture--which requires a network  connection from a client to a possible distant server for each document  retrieved--is not scalable.  Servers and network have limited bandwidth  that cannot keep pace with continuing growth in Web usage, particularly as  the popularity of bandwidth-intensive media types, such as video, grows.  This project addresses Web scalability by characterizing WWW traffic and  applying that characterization to design and evaluating algorithms to cache  and prefetch documents within networks.    The project has five objectives: to 1) collect traces from four disparate  traffic sources; 2) prepare to handle the large volume of collected traces  by extending methods to collect, visualize, analyze, and model Web traffic  using the Chitra trace analysis tool; 3) use techniques from objective two  to characterize Web traffic based on the traces collected for objective  one; 4) develop a predictive model and simulation of clients, servers, and  Web traffic in the context of universities and community networks that  permits the design and evaluation of algorithms for in-network document  caching to reduce the bandwidth requirements of Web servers and networks.  The simulation will use results from workload characterization. The model  will allow a network manager to place and configure in network caches (e.g.  proxy servers) within an existing network; and 5) design and evaluate,  through simulation, algorithms to prefetch documents, thereby partially  hiding latency.",
