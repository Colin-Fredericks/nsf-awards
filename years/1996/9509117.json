 "awd_abstract_narration": "9509117  Bronzino  The primary hypothesis to be investigated is that, during  normal development, the maturation of peak hippocampal theta  frequency is related primarily to changes in the modulation  of dentate granule cell activity, and not due to alterations  in cellular excitability of CA1 pyramidal cells.  Another  hypothesis to be tested is that the biocoherence index is an  effective measure of the changing interrelationships that  occur between CA1 and the dentate gyrus during development  of hippocampal activity.  In previous research surgical and  recording techniques were developed that allow a  quantitative examination of the development of  inhibitory/facilitatory modulation of the dentate granule  cell population.  Modeling techniques will be used to  characterize the development of the rat hippocampal EEG  during the early postnatal (15-22 days) period of  development.    The studies are expected to provide new knowledge on the  interactions that occur between hippocampal neural systems  responsible for the generation of hippocampal EEG patters as  the animal iteracts with its environment during the early  postnatal period of development.  The results will provide  new approaches to probe questions related to the maturation  of neural circuits and developmental patterns of the EEG in  behaving animals.    The project provides a high quality research experience to  undergraduate students through their active participation in  surgery and recording techniques and to the development of  quantitative and computational techniques applied to  problems in biology.  ***",
