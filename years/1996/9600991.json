Dr. Garcia-Moreno is studying the energetics of acid  denaturation of staphylococcal nuclease with equilibrium  thermodynamic methods.  An extensive collection of mutants  where ionizable residues have been substituted by uncharged  amino acids will be used to determine the role of individual  ionizable residues.  The emphasis is on resolving the  contributions by individual residues because that is the  level needed to advance our current understanding of the  mechanisms of stability and folding of proteins.  Another  goal is to characterize the physical and structural  properties of compact denatured states of nuclease, and to  establish the molecular determinants of the electrostatic  effects that poise for denaturation by acid.  Dr. Garcia-  Moreno's research is intimately interwoven with his teaching  and training of students at the graduate and undergraduate  levels.  %%%  The stability of a folded protein is always defined relative  to a  protein in a denatured state.  While much is already  known about the structure and physico-chemical character of  folded proteins, those of denatured proteins remain largely  unexplored.  In order to understand fully the relationship  between the structure of a protein and its stability it is  necessary to understand better the denatured state.  Denatured proteins do not necessarily exist as truly random,  unfolded polypeptides.  Many denatured proteins are compact  and retain many of the structural and physical attributes of  the fully folded protein.  Dr. Garcia-Moreno hopes to gain  insights about the manner in which proteins achieve their  folded state by determining the sequence of  events that  leads to transitions between folded and denatured proteins.  He will also study some  of the noncovalent forces that  stabilize proteins in compact denatured st ates.  Nuclease is  a protein well suited for these studies because it is not  very stable and can be coaxed into compact denatured states  easily with acid, temperature or chemical denaturants.  Dr.  Garcia-Moreno is developing courses in molecular physiology  and in protein thermodynamics where graduate and  undergraduate students will learn the fundamental of  macromolecular structure, energetics and function by using  computers to analyze high resolution structures graphically,  to predict energetics from structure, and to simulate  complex phenomena such as the conformational transitions  that he will study in the proposed research.  ***",
