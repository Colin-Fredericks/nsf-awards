 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510460  Watson    Colloidal crystals, fabricated from microsphere dielectric  particles, can be tailored to satisfy the Bragg condition  for visible and near infrared light.  The interaction of  light with the optical lattice results in photonic band  structure that is analogous to electronic band structure in  atomic crystals.  Spectroscopic and interferometric  determination of photonic band structure  will be extended  from the visible to the near infrared.  In addition to  continued investigation of photonic band structure in theses  crystals and its implications for photon localization, new  initiatives include the study of (1) impurity modes in  photonic stop bands and (2) interaction of band structure  effects and nonlinear optical properties.  %%%  The technological developments of the past 50 years,  initiated with the invention of the transistor, were  possible only by the extensive and continued research of the  physical properties of semiconductor materials.  Future  photonic analogs of today's electronic devices, where light  action replaces that of the electron, may sustain these  technological advancements at the current rate.  The  behavior of light in photonics crystals wil l be  experimentally studied by numerous optical methods in an  attempt to understand the issues of photon transport and  localization in future devices, and its relationship to  electron transport and localization in current devices.***",
