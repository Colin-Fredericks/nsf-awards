 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623355  Smith    The ultimate goals of this research are to fabricate atomic-  scale wires, perhaps even one atom in diameter, and to make  low- temperature electrical measurements on them.  The wires  will be created by a combination of natural growth and  patterning with the scanning tunneling microscope (STM).  Early experiments will include imaging of a metal-chain-  forming system not previously studied by STM and studies of  chain stability.  Intermediate-scale contact probes to  bridge between the chains and macroscopic contacts will be  made using either step-edge evaporation or  STM chemical  vapor deposition.  Experiments in this phase will examine  any disruptive effects of these intermediate-scale pads on  the atomic chains, and also any problems with electrical  contact between the pads and the chains.  Once a sample is  made, it will be transferred to a low-temperature stage  within the same ultrahigh vacuum chamber, and its electrical  properties will be measured.  As a prelude to all the above  experiments, a study of the effects of stray capacitance on  single electron tunneling (SET) will be performed.  %%%  This basic research project will examine some of the  apparent challenges in creating atomic-scale electronic  circuits.  Our ultimate goals are to make the simplest of  all such circuits, an atomic-scale wire (perhaps even one  atom in diameter), and to perform low-temperature electrical  measurements on it to explore quantum mechanical effects.  We will make the wire using a combination of natural  ordering of metals on semiconductor substrates, patterning  with the scanning tunneling microscope, and \"step-edge  evaporation\", a technique which uses small steps in the  substrate to create nanometer-scale structures.  There are  several apparent challenges .  For most materials, it  appears that the electrons needed for electrical conduction  within the wire would be sucked away by the substrate on  which the wires are created.  The creation of electrical  connections betw een the wires and the macroscopic world may  disrupt the wires, or the wires might be disrupted by  thermal fluctuations.  Electrical contact between the wires  and the macroscopic contacts may prove difficult.  However,  we are confident that each of these challenges can be met,  and suggest several promising strategies.  ***",
