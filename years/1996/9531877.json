 "awd_abstract_narration": "9531877    Bower    In this project, the PIs will study the North Atlantic Current, which    transports subtropical water northeastward from the Gulf Stream, and the   Poleward Eastern Boundary Current, which carries Mediterranean Outflow Water   northward along the European continental slope.  These two current systems are   thought to be the two most likely sources of warm, salty water that is   transformed into intermediate and deep water in the subpolar region.  Specific   objectives are to:  1) provide a quantitative description of the bifurcation   of the North Atlantic Current east of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge; 2) assess the   importance of meridional eddy fluxes, compared to large-scale advection, in   the northward flux of heat and salt in the northeastern North Atlantic; and 3)   establish the degree of continuity of the Poleward Eastern Boundary Current to   the entrance to the Norwegian Sea and the fate of the Mediterranean Outflow   Water carried by this current.    To meet these objectives, a total of 68 isopycnal, acoustically-tracked RAFOS   floats will be deployed in the eastern Basin of the North Atlantic, forty in   and adjacent to the North Atlantic Current, and twenty-eight near the eastern   boundary. The floats will drift submerged for two years, sampling three   cooling seasons, with tracking provided once daily using moored sound sources.    This study is a contribution to the US Atlantic Circulation and Climate   Experiment (ACCE), and to the International World Ocean Circulation Experiment   (WOCE). The high-resolution RAFOS floats will specifically address important   features of the circulation that have relatively short time and/or spatial   scales, such as bifurcations, eddy mixing and boundary flows.",
