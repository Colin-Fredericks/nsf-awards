 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves investigating the major processes occurring  in the Io plasma torus - the sources and losses of material; the  mechanisms of energy transfer from Jupiter to the plasma and  between the plasma species and radiation fields; and the response  of the torus to changes in the volcanic output to Io.    By building on previous models of the torus structure, Dr. Bagenal  will combine in situ particles and fields measurements obtained on  the initial passage of the Galileo spacecraft through the torus  with remote sensing measurements obtained on subsequent orbits to  determine the 3-dimensional distributions of plasma properties   (density, temperature, composition) and their variations with time.   By building on these models of the torus chemistry, she will:   model the production of plasma from Iogenic neutral material  following the plasma as it diffuses radially; calculate sources and  losses of each species through ionization and charge-exchange  processes; and compute energy pick-up, transfer and radiation  losses.      Interactive activities include running the Space Physics Seminars,  teaching a graduate special research topics course, working with  the UCLA Committee on Gender Issues, and running a seminar/workshop  on gender issues.",
