 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research uses methods of mathematics and statistics, in  conjunction with experimental work in two cell biology  laboratories, to clarify the first responses of cells to  extracellular \"signaling\" molecules.  Hormones, cytokines, immune  complexes and antigens all initiate cellular responses through  interactions with specific cell surface \"receptors.\"  Diverse  systems have in common the two initial events in cell signaling  that this project addresses, the aggregation of cell surface  receptors, followed by the phosphorylation of tyrosine on receptors  and non-receptor proteins.    The first collaboration investigates mechanisms and effects of  receptor aggregation through the analysis of molecular point  patterns on electron microscope images.  The second collaboration  focusses on mechanisms by which aggregated receptors mediate  tyrosine phosphorylation.  A proposed model appears to be  consistent with previously obtained data and makes additional  testable predictions.    Interactive activities include:  teaching a graduate course on  \"Stochastic Models in Biology and Chemistry,\" and organizing  special visits of women with active research programs in  Mathematical Biology, Biostatistics, Biophysics, and related  sciences.  Activities aimed at fostering interactions of students  with the visitors include preparatory seminars preceding the  visits, a student-oriented talk as part of each visit, and  organized discussions between students and visitors.",
