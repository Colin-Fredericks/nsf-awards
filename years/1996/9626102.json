For some populations,  adaptive strategies produce substantial increases in precision of  estimates compared to conventional designs with equivalent sample  sizes.  The research investigates new classes of adaptive designs  and inference procedures and develops the needed basic theory.   The research involves a combination of design-based and  model-based approaches, and includes investigations in adaptive  cluster sampling, adaptive allocation, adaptive graph sampling,  optimal sampling strategies, multivariate methods in adaptive  sampling including rapid-assessment strategies, and nonsampling  errors in adaptive sampling.    With adaptive sampling designs, the procedure for selecting the  sample can be changed during a survey in response to observed  patterns in the population.  For example, in a survey of a rare,  endangered animal species, whenever members of the species are  detected, additional observations may be made at neighboring  sites.  In environmental pollution assessment studies, an  adaptive plan allows additional observations to be made in the  vicinity of observed \"hot spots.\"  Similarly, in surveys of   hard-to-access human populations, social links between  individuals may be adaptively used in obtaining the sample.  Such  designs are in marked contrast to conventional survey designs, in  which the sites or people to be included in the sample can be  determined prior to making any observations or obtaining any  responses.  Research in adaptive sampling has many important  applications in environmental studies, including surveys of  endangered species, natural resources, and environmental  pollutants, as well as for scientific studies of hidden or  hard-to-access human populations.  Advantages of adaptive  sampling strategies include the potential for obtaining better  estimates of popu lation quantities with a given amount of  sampling effort.  Adaptive cluster sampling designs, for example,  have been shown to be highly efficient relative to conventional  designs for sampling populations that are very unevenly  distributed.  Adaptive designs can significantly increase the  \"yield\" of the sample, so that, for example, more animals of the  rare species are observed, while at the same time permitting  unbiased estimation of quantities such as the total number of the  animals in the population.
