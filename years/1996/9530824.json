This work is one of forty-four projects that are  collaborating in the Southern Ocean Experiment, a threeyear  effort south of the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone to track  the flow of carbon through its organic and inorganic  pathways from the air-ocean interface through the entire  water column into the bottom sediment.   The experiment will  make use of two ships, the RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer and the  R/V Thompson.        The Southern Ocean has been implicated, by ocean  models, as an important region of oceanic uptake of  anthropogenically produced carbon dioxide.  There is  however, little data to corroborate these model predictions.  There are three characteristics of the Southern Ocean that  likely have a major impact on the strength of this region as  a carbon dioxide sink: deep waters upwell close the surface,  high wind speeds cause rapid air-sea exchange of heat and  gases, and biological productivity occurs both in the open  ocean and at the ice edge.  The interplay between these  three processes controls the surface carbon dioxide  concentrations and thus the direction and magnitude of air-  sea gas exchange.         This project will use a combination of chemical  measurements and a wind-driven circulation model to  determine how deep water upwelling in this region exchanges  carbon dioxide with the surface layer, and how air-sea  exchange and biological productivity offset the effects of  upwelling on the surface carbon dioxide levels.       The measurement and modeling activities will yield a  quantitative explan ation of how the air-sea flux of carbon  dioxide in the Southern Ocean is affected by circulation,  gas exchange and biological productivity.  The model results  will be used to predict how the surface carbon dioxide  levels and the ratio of carbon isotopes in the dissolved  inorganic carbon pool of the ocean respond to changes in  circulation rates and pathways caused by different  atmospheric conditions.  These results will help  reconstructions of past conditions of CO2 levels in the  Southern Ocean that are based on proxy measurements in  marine sediments and continental ice cores.  ***",
