 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514244  Barker      This award supports the participation of ten American researchers  at a workshop on Large Molecule Energy Transfer to be held at  McLaren Vale, South Australia, July 7 through 12, 1996.  The  American organizer is Prof. John Barker from the Department of  Atmospheric, Oceanic and Space Sciences at The University of  Michigan.  The Australian organizer is Prof. Keith King of the  Department of Chemical Engineering of the University of Adelaide.    The workshop will focus on collisional energy transfer involving  highly vibrationally excited molecules.  The objectives of the  workshop are: 1) to acquaint energy transfer researchers with the  current state of theoretical and experimental knowledge in  dealing with large and small molecular systems; 2) to identify  experiments and theoretical developments which will have the  greatest impact on advancing knowledge about large molecular  vibrational energy transfer; and 3) to foster further  collaboration and communication between U.S. and Australian  scientists in this area of research which should be of mutual  benefit to investigators in both countries.  The Australian  support for the workshop is provided by the Australian Department  of Industry, Science and Tourism (DIST).  The existence of a  final report, to be made available at World-Wide Web sites in  both the United States and Australia, will be announced through  the \"Molecular Dynamics Newsletter\", distributed internationally,  and in \"Chemistry in Australia\", which is distributed in  Australia.",
