 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623925  Wyatt   Most flowering plants are hermaphroditic, producing both male and female reproductive organs.  Consequently, self-pollination as well as cross-pollination is possible.  Self-pollinated flowers often are less likely to set seed than cross-pollinated flowers. Mechanisms responsible for the loss of seed production include the action of genetic self-incompatibility systems and the effects of early-acting inbreeding depression.  Distinguishing between these two causes of sterility is challenging, especially for species that exhibit either late-acting self-incompatibility or post- pollination selection of outcrossed offspring over selfed ones. The research funded by this award resolves these different mechanisms in two species of milkweeds (Asclepias), using experimental crosses.  First, experiments will test whether self sterility results from either the abortion of selfed embryos due to early-acting inbreeding depression or the rejection of selfed zygotes based on late-acting self-incompatibility. If late-acting self-incompatibility is implicated, its genetic basis will be determined.  Second, the role of  post-pollination selection in causing non random mating in a self-fertile milkweed will be resolved.    These studies will help to clarify the importance of inbreeding depression and self-incompatibility in mating system evolution.  Because inbreeding depression is a problem in both applied agricultural systems and endangered plant populations, understanding mechanisms that alleviate inbreeding can inform efforts for crop improvement and native plant conservation.",
