 "awd_abstract_narration": "9631744  Yamaguchi  This proposal is a continuation of a program senior design  project program which has been successfully implemented over the  past six years at ASU.  The program centers on a \"bottom-up\"  approach to rehabilitation which requires the participants to  interact directly with their clients; this permits the students  to learn the needs of the client first-hand and to be open to  suggestions, resulting in a sense of pride and ownership in the  final products for both parties.  Another philosophy conveyed to  the students is the idea of developing \"culturally appropriate\"  solutions which can be easily maintained by the clients and their  caretakers.  Fifteen senior design projects will be solicited  each year to design prototype devices to aid persons with  disabilities.  A graduate student will act as a liaison to  establish and maintain continuous connection between the  biomedical engineering program at ASU and surrounding communities  serving and/or supporting persons with disabilities.  The ideas  and feasible projects for the program will be generated through  this connection.  Each senior design student selected to  participate will then establish contact, via the graduate  liaison, with coordinating clinicians and a specific person with  a disability, and work together with that person to generate the  design specifications of the device to meet the specific need of  that individual.  The student will design, build, deliver and  evaluate a prototype device to aid the individual in improving  independence.  Two undergraduate students will be supported each  summer to follow up with each client to make necessary  modification and completion to the device, which will ensure that  the device can actually be used by the client, and train the  students on quality control and custom service for biomedical  devices aiding persons with disabilities.  ***",
