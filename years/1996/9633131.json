The primary objectives of the study are: (1) to  examine spatial and temporal effects of fast- versus  slow-spreading ridge axes on intraspecific phylogeography,  patterns of dispersal, and rates of gene flow; and (2) to continue  our studies of evolutionary relationships among organisms from  deep-sea hydrothermal vents and cognate communities in other  reducing environments (e.g., cold-water sulfide/methane seeps,  whale fall, etc.). As a result of previous oceanic expeditions, an  extensive collection of frozen specimens from fast-spreading ridge  systems in the eastern Pacific already exists at Rutgers  University. These organisms have been the focus of ongoing studies  of gene flow and patterns of dispersal. To test the hypothesis  that the spreading rate of a ridge system plays a dominant role in  shaping ecological and evolutionary processes, comparative studies  will be conducted with organisms from a slow-spreading system (the  Mid-Atlantic Ridge) and a super fast-spreading system (the  southern East Pacific Rise). Additionally, ongoing molecular  systematic studies of vent and seep bivalve mollusks will be  continued, as many new populations and new morphospecies have been  described during the last several years. Some of the vesicomyid  clam species, in particular, appear to wide distributions that  span oceanic basins and terrestrial barriers to dispersal. As the  goal of these studies is to obtain multi-locus genealogical  information for population level and phylogenetic analyses, a  variety of genetic techniques are employ ed (e.g., allozymes,  restriction analysis of mitochondrial DNA and anonymous nuclear  DNAs, and sequencing of PCR amplified genes). Partial use of an  automated sequencing facility is available to the principal  investigators. These proposed studies will provide a comprehensive  picture of ecological, geological, and evolutionary processes  affecting the dominant species that live in these unusual abyssal  environments. Present research already has produced molecular  markers that are of broad use for students of invertebrate  systematics and population genetics. The biodiversity aspects of  this research have been recognized with a supplementary award  (NIH) to facilitate materials and technology transfer to parties  interested in marine natural products discovery.",
