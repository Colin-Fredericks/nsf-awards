 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ordway  9514485    As the organ system responsible for controlling movements, sensing  surroundings, and consciousness, the nervous system must be capable  of rapid information processing and rapid transmission of that  information throughout the organism.  To meet these demands, the  nervous system is composed of complex networks of cells which, like  electrical networks in computers, use electricity for information  processing and transmission.  In order for the nervous system to  function, individual nerve cells must convey electrical signals to  other nerve cells in the network.  This transmission occurs at  specialized sites of contact between two nerve cells, called  synapses and is generally mediated by a complex process where  electrical information is converted into chemical information.  The  chemical signals are responsible for information transfer across  the synapse.  Understanding chemical synaptic transmission, and  thus the mechanisms by which nerve cells can send and receive  electrical signals, is essential to understanding the fundamental  mechanisms of nervous system function.  Using a simplified model  system which functions similarly to more complex nervous systems,  a better understanding of information processing can be gained.   This simple model system is also amenable to a wide variety of  molecular genetic approaches allowing even more powerful  understanding of nervous system function.  Dr. Ordway is using a  simplified model system to investigate the function of a specific  synaptic protein called NSF.  Using the molecular approaches  alluded to above, Dr. Ordway is investigating the function of NSF  in chemical synaptic transmission when the function of NSF has been  perturbed.  The basic mechanisms of nervous tissues have been  conserved during evolution and information from simpler systems  will lead directly to a better understanding of the function of our  own brain and nervous system.",
