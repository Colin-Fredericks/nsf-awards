 "awd_abstract_narration": "9531797  Wollkind    The development of one- and two-dimensional Turing patterns characteristic of  the chlorite-iodide-malonic acid/indicator reaction occurring in an open gel  continuously fed unstirred reactor is to be investigated by means of various    weakly nonlinear stability analyses applied to the appropriately scaled govern-  ing chlorine dioxide-iodine-malonic acid/indicator model system. It is then   proposed that the resulting theoretical predictions deduced from these pattern  formation studies be compared both with the recent experimental evidence rele-  vant to the diffusive instabilities under examination which consist of stripes,  rhombic arrays of rectangles, and hexagonal arrays of spots or nets, and with  similar equilibrium structures characteristic of a diffusion system used to  model interfacial morphologies observed during alloy solidification. The ra-  tionale for these comparisons is to explain more fully the transition to such  stationary symmetry breaking spatial Turing structures when the malonic acid  reservoir concentration varies in the first case and to examine the unifying  as well as divergent aspects of the model systems in the second. Finally the   nonequilibrium Turing and morphological instabilities of chemical turbulence  and cellular dendrites, respectively, are to be investigated by application of   a numerical bifurcation code to the amplitude equations of nonlinear stability  theory in the appropriate parameter ranges for these two phenomena. The antici-  pated results of this research have the potential to contribute to the under-  standing of pattern formation in a wide variety of application areas.  %%%    The long-term goal of this project is to develop the simplest reasonable natu-  ral science models which preserve the essential features of pattern formation  while still being consistent with observation. The candidates for such mathe-   matical modeling are those structures generated during chemical reactions in     gels and during the solidif ication of two-component mixtures, respectively.   Quantification of that sort would allow an experimentalist to obtain a desired     outcome without wasting the time and money caused by repeated unsuccessful       trials. The relevant application areas for this work range from combustion   theory and other energy related interactions to materials processing involving   semi-conductor production and steel manufacturing.   ***",
