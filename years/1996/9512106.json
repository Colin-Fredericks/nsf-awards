 "awd_abstract_narration": "9512106  Pakes    Industries and firms evolve over time.  The object of the  proposed research is to model what firms and industries look like  at a particular point of time and how they change over time.   Firms and industries are affected by the characteristics of the  firms, the competitors and consumers.  The model deals with the  common existence of differentiated products.  Plant, product, and  detailed consumer demand data are integrated into the model,  which is applied to the automobile and consumer electronics  industry.  The dynamic model is an exploratory model, as the  model is complicated by the number of possible changes in the  firms and industries over time.  An attempt is made to make the  dynamic model more tractable, by determining what frameworks are  most relevant and concentrating on models with those features.    Investment strategies and the cost of entering and exiting an  industry are part of the dynamic model.  In principle, a general  dynamic model could be used to determine the future course of a  significant number of firms and industries from any initial  condition.  The proposed research will examine ways to generalize  the more specific model by used advanced computational methods.   If the research is successful, the model could be applied to a  much wider range of industries.",
