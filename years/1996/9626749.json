 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lopez  9626749       The investigator and his colleague study computational  aspects of convex geometry in two directions: (1) Design and  implementation of efficient algorithms for the approximation of  convex bodies in multidimensional space by convex polytopes with  a priori specified number of vertices.  Specific instances that  arise in various application areas, such as the approximation of  polytopes by smaller polytopes, are given special attention.  Extensions, such as approximation under various metrics, also are  considered. (2) Application of high performance computing to  solve or to advance toward the solution of a number of  long-standing problems in convex geometry.  An important example  is Mahler's conjecture on the volume-product of a convex body and  its polar body.  An instance of this problem with applications to  the theory of wavelets is tackled by reducing the search space to  a finite but large set of cases that can be verified  computationally.       The investigator and colleague study efficient computational  solutions for the problem of approximating multidimensional  convex bodies by polytopes (solids formed by plane faces) of a  prescribed size.  Such approximation is an important tool in many  disciplines, including molecular modeling, optimal control,  computer-aided design, pattern recognition, and computer  visualization.  Furthermore, due to their simplicity, polytopes  are by far the most widely used form of model representation.  Thus, the work is also important because it facilitates the use  of the large body of methods already available for polytopes,  provided that the resulting approximation is good and can be  performed efficiently.  Symbolically, long-standing geometric  problems are attacked using the tools of high performance  computing.  An approach based on verifying computationally a large  but finite number of possible cases promises to yield an  important advance in the field.",
