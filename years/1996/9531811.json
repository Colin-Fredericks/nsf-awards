The primary  theoretical focus of this work is the analysis of bifurcations to  periodic solutions near resonance for multidimensional  multiparameter systems and the description of related phenomena,  especially the phenomenon of passage through resonance.  The  methods employed include several aspects of the geometric  analysis of nonlinear dynamics and classical perturbation theory:  ``Melnikov'' theory, Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, elliptic  functions and expansion in a small parameter.  There is also an  important computational component; especially, integration of  differential equations, computer graphics and computer algebra.   The theory will be applied to physical systems modeled by systems  of coupled nonlinear differential equations. The primary  application proposed for this project is to study the motions of  a DC motor driven  mechanical linkage.  It is proposed to  determine the existence and stability of periodic motions, the  stabilization of periodic motions by feedback control and the  effects of slow variation of control parameters near resonance.    When mechanical or electrical components are linked together (for  example when a motor is connected to a machine) it is important  to determine the subsequent operational capabilities of the  coupled system. In the design and operational control of coupled  systems the following phenomenon can occur: a small effect  produced by one of the components can have a large effect on the  operation of the coupled system.  This phenomenon can be used to  advantage in electrical devices, for example amplifiers, but  often it has dramatic undesirable consequences when present in  machinery. A motor attached to an elastic support may operate  smoothly until a small change in its rotational speed causes a  large vibration and subsequent failure of the motor or its  linkage.  This is analogous to the classic example of a n opera  singer breaking a wine glass with her voice.  The proposed  research seeks to find methods to determine the effects of  couplings among mechanical or electrical components by developing   techniques to analyze mathematical models for the operation of  such coupled systems.  These methods will be useful in the design  of machinery as well as the design of auxiliary systems needed to  control its operation.  ***",
