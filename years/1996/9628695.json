 "awd_abstract_narration": "9628695 Rozgonyi  This research project is a collaborative effort between researchers at NCSU and Oak Ridge National Labs(ORNL) to study fundamental mechanisms and phenomena associated with radiation-produced defects in silicon, and the complex interactions that control defect formation, diffusion and annihilation.  The project will investigate the effects of in situ changes to the electronic state of semiconductors by photoexcitation and/or internal electric fields on damage accumulation processes. In situ measurement of specific defect levels in ion implanted silicon will be made by deep level transient spectroscopy(DLTS).  Ion flux and temperature variations, as well as in situ photoexcitation during implantation coupled with in situ DLTS measurements will be used to elucidate specific mechanisms of defect formation and reaction in silicon with extension of these studies to GaAs, GaN, and SiC anticipated.   %%% The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level of technological relevance to advanced electronic materials processing.  Additionally, the knowledge and understanding gained from this research project is expected to contribute in a general way to improving the performance of advanced devices and circuits by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and processing advanced materials and devices.  An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***",
