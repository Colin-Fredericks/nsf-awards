 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research project is to develop a set of Virtual Environment Readaptation Mechanisms (VERM) that facilitate user recovery to normative conditions after exposure to a virtual environment (VE).  While considerable work is being done to characterize motion sickness and identify the potential maladaptive aftereffects from human-virtual environments, there are currently few efforts focusing on the actions to be taken when post-exposure aftereffects are identified.  This research focuses on demonstrating the feasibility of developing provocative activities conducive to visual and visuomotor recalibration of known post-exposure disturbances, including ataxia (i.e., postural instability), vestibulo-ocular reflex gain/phase changes, and degraded eye-hand coordination.  The approach consists of testing the effectiveness of three post-exposure readaptation mechanisms (locomotion activities, visual tracking tasks, and peg-in-hole tasks) to facilitate user readaptation under varying degrees of exposure duration, user initiated control, and visual scene complexity.  The results of this research will provide an understanding of post-exposure readaptation, as well as provide mechanisms that facilitate a timely recovery from VE exposure.  The VERM have possible application by VE system developers in specifying post-exposure protocols that verify when the aftereffects from VE exposure have dissipated, thereby maintaining the safety of users and minimizing the liability of developers.",
