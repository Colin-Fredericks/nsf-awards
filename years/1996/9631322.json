 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year project will continue documentation and  description of the Arawan, Muran, and Chapakuran families, spoken  in the states of Amazonas and Rondonia in Western Brazil. This  effort wi11 result in full grammars (dictionaries, phonetics,  phonology, morphology, and syntax) of Suruwaha (the only Arawan  language yet undescribed; spoken by 100-200 people in the state  of Amazonas, Brazil); 'Oro Win (a dying Chapakuran language  spoken by only five people (all over forty years of age) in  Western Rondonia); and Piraha (spoken by approximately 200 people  in Amazonas). This study will also include the first systematic  linguistic survey of Mura, a language closely related to Piraha,  to verify whether or not anyone still speaks this language,  previously documented only by word lists collected by explorers  in the 19th and early 20th century. The project will result in  several theoretically and typologically oriented articles on  aspects of the phonetics, phonology, morphosyntax, and semantics  of these languages - all three of these families are known for  their unusual typological characteristics (phonological and  morphosyntactic, described in the project description).  The  research is significant because it provides a basis for future  theoretical, typological, and historical-comparative studies of  these otherwise nearly unknown families and because it directly  tests several hypotheses relevant to current phonological and  syntactic theory.",
