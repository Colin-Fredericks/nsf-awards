Due to dramatic improvements in computer  hardware and computational algorithms, molecular modeling of  polymers has seen significant advances in the last few years.  As  these techniques become increasingly utilized tools in materials  research, the need for force fields which accurately describe  intermolecular and intramolecular interactions will  correspondingly increase, as will the need to expose both  graduate and undergraduate students to the power and utility, and  limitations, of these methods.  In this grant, the properties of  poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) in  aqueous solution will be investigated via ab initio quantum  chemistry calculations and molecular dynamics simulations.  The  main questions to be answered relate to the interactions of these  polymers, one of which is water soluble (PEO) and the other which  is not (PPO), with the water solvent.  These issues are of great  interest because PEO and PEO/PPO copolymers are used in a wide  variety of applications where the desired properties are  determined by the behavior of the polymers in aqueous solution.  Among these is the modification of surfaces to provide protein  and cell resistance for many important applications, including  controlled release agents, encapsulated enzymes and injectable  therapeutic and diagnostic agents.  The excellent protein  resistant properties of PEO polymers are believed to be a result  of the unique solution properties of PEO and its molecular  conformation in aqueous solution.    In order to expose undergraduate students to these modeling  techniques, a Computational Materials Science Program will be  instituted.  The program will consist of a new materials  science/molecular physics course for upper-division undergraduate  and graduate students.
