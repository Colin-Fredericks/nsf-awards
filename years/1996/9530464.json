 "awd_abstract_narration": "9530464    The objectives of this research program are to investigate  and clarify  fundamental questions in relation to the geostatic stress  condition in  undisturbed ground, as well as in clays and granular soils  subjected to  sampling, in situ testing, earthquake shaking, or  construction operations,  including ground modification. Effective horizontal pressure  has a  significant effect on resistance to settlement and  liquefaction of granular  soils. as well as on ground response to in situ tests before  and after  ground modification.  The specific questions formulated for  investigation  include the permanent effect of pre-shearing on the  horizontal pressure in  the laterally constrained level ground condition, and  settlement of clean  granular soils subjected to cyclic pre-shearing. The  research method relies  on exacting experimental techniques and long-term laboratory  and field  observations, as well as mathematical modeling and numerical  analysis.  High quality undisturbed samples of natural clays, as well  as reconstituted  specimens of natural sand deposits, are used in the  laboratory  investigations.  ***",
