 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vanderlick  9630029    This proposal requests funds in partial support of the Interfaces Gordon Conference to be held 21-26 July 1996 at Kimball Union Academy in Meriden, New Hampshire.  The funds requested will be used to defray travel and conference expenses for some of the speakers attending the conference and principally for promising students and junior faculty attending the conference.    The purpose of the conference is to encourage the transfer of ideas at the frontiers of chemistry at interfaces, among several groups of scientists, including electrochemists, biophysicists and membrane biologists, chemical engineers, and colloid and surface scientists, and to focus on the topic of Interfacial Structure as it relates to liquid/air, liquid/liquid, and liquid/solid interfaces.  The spatial arrangement of interfacial molecules normal and parallel to the interfaces is the key structural issue that will be focused upon.  This resolution will range from atomic scale to supramolecular.    The conference topic is an important focal point for examining physical pheomena that occur in colloidal systems such as micellar solutions, microemulsions, emulsions, dispersions, slurries, etc.  This symposium will serve to summarize our current understanding of interfacial structure in these systems, and the relation of this structure to chemical and physiochemical phenomena.  Simulations and experiments are becoming complementary approaches to investigating the structure of these interfacial systems, so the proposed conference is particularly timely.  In addition to papers that address our ability to resolve structural issues, are papers that address chemistry occurring at these same interfaces, and the relation of the resulting chemistry to the interfacial structure.    The format of the conference is built around invited speakers detailing the scientific frontiers of their research.  Half of the formal conference time is devoted to discussion of topics addressed by the speakers and by the discussion leade rs.  The formal sessions are held in the morning and after dinner in the evening.  One afternoon workshop is scheduled, and two poster session are scheduled in later afternoon time slots.  Posters are contributed by the various conferees, and afford a venue for additional contributions relevant to the conference theme.  ***",
