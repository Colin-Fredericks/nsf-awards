A search for  a  liquid  phase  of H2 below 5.7K, the lowest triple point on record,  will  be conducted. Should a liquid phase be observed down to 2K or so,  superfluid properties are expected. A careful survey of  freezing  and  possible  phase  separation  in  H2-D2  film  mixtures  (and  comparison   studies  with  3He-4He  mixtures)  will   be   done.  Measurements  of the frost heave pressure of H2 condensed  inside  micropores, where a surface melted layer of H2 should respond  to  a  temperature  gradient along the sample by  sustaining  a  very  large  pressure  gradient, will be performed. Neutron  and  X-ray  scattering  measurements on the various  hydrogen  isotopes  will  measure   structure  and  transport  properties.   Graduate   and  undergraduate  students  are  involved  in  all  aspects  of  the  project.  %%%  This  project  will  explore,  using  different  conditions   and  techniques,  the possible existence of liquid hydrogen  films  to  very  low temperatures. Films of hydrogen formed on special solid  substrates and hydrogen frozen inside porous materials may  yield  liquid  films  which  will  have unusual  new  fluid  flow,  heat  transport,  and/or  pressure gradient properties.  The  technical  side  of  the  project will measure liquid and  solid  properties  through   thermal,   pressure  gradient,   neutron,   and   X-ray  experiments  on the stable molecules of hydrogen, deuterium,  and  deuterium  hydride,  and  their mixtures. Comparison  experiments  will  be done using helium isotopes which are known to be  fluid.  Graduate  and undergraduate students are involved in all  aspects  of this project.  ***",
