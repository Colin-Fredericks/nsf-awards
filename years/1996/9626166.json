The main theme is to study conjectures of Sir Michael Atiyah on  (homology) three-spheres, using invariants obtained from mathematical  physics, especially conformal field theory and string theory, and  symplectic topology.  The investigator and R. Lee have studied the  first conjecture of Sir Michael Atiyah on identifying these invariants  of three-spheres, and also extended the invariants to slightly larger  classes of three-spheres.  The major part of this project is, not only  to identify these invariants (the first Atiyah conjecture), but also  to identify the way to relate these invariants to each other (the  second Atiyah conjecture).  Such an identification suggests a \"hidden  duality\" between conformal field theory and four-dimensional  Yang-Mills theory.  The other part of this project is to study  intrinsic properties for the invariants of larger classes of  three-spheres.  It is a fundamental aim to investigate the change of  the new invariants under certain topological operations.  The project  will lead to a study of relations between Floer theory, which is an  invariant from mathematical physics, and other constructions of knot  theory, as well as the generalization of the invariants to general  three-manifolds.       A three-dimensional manifold is a space where a nearsighted person  sees a standard three-dimensional space everywhere.  (Homology)  three-spheres are those three-manifolds that one cannot tell from the  standard three-sphere by using the usual topological tools.  That such exist  indicates the complexity of the world we live in, even ignoring the time  dimension, thus making three-spheres of cosmological and physical  interest.  The topological invariants in the project are intended to  distinguish manifolds by systematically studying their properties with  respect to several quantum field theories.  It is therefore valuable  to investigate these new invariants and their structure s for  three-spheres and general three-manifolds.  This project addresses  some of the most fundamental problems in this subject.  ***",
