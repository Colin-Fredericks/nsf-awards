 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMI-9634701  Osswald   In most polymer processes the quality of the final part stems back in great part to the mixing of the polymer blends and the viscous heating that occurs during the process.  Both the material properties and the formability of the component into shaped parts are highly influenced by the quality of the mixing.  Optimizing mixing processes is time consuming and expensive.  It is often necessary to build complex visualization equipment, i.e. model extruders with transparent barrels, to qualify the mixing processes.  This research project will investigate a simulation program and to model the mixing phenomena of polymer blends inside complex three dimensional mixing devices, such as single and screw extruders.   This project is a NSF GOALI project and will be in partnership with 3M Process Development-Polymer Processing Laboratory.  The flow visualization experiments will be performed at the University of Wisconsin and the twin screw extrusion experiments will be carried out at 3M.  Results of this research project could provide valuable findings in the optimization of existing processing equipment and development of new engineering materials through blending of existing polymers, fillers, and solutions.",
