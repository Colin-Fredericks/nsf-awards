Potential  benefits derived include: diverting a significant industrial  waste into a useful product; improving both the cost  effectiveness and environmental impact of paper recycling;  raising the cost-effectiveness of ethanol production and  mineral recovery from paper sludge relative to either of  these endeavors undertaken alone; improving the technical  feasibility of recovering and reusing minerals from paper  sludge; providing a entry point and proving ground for the  emergent biomass ethanol industry.    Research is proposed that builds upon an extensive data base  on paper sludge composition and convertibility to ethanol  assembled by the P.I.  Proposed tasks will characterize,  improve and evaluate:  --continuous simultaneous saccharification and fermentation  (SSF) for conversion of pretreated and non-pretreated paper  sludges to ethanol.  --use of Trichoderma reesei for the production of cellulase  from paper-sludge for use in an SSF system.  --use of thermophilic bacteria for continuous conversion of  paper sludge to ethanol.  --liquid hot water (LHW) pretreatment as a means to increase  the fraction of paper sludges that exhibit high conversion  to ethanol  and  --Perform measurements on mineral residues pursuant to  evaluating their amenability to recycling.",
