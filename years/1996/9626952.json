Concerned that the general  public is largely uninformed about the results of the years of  basic science research carried out by U.S. scientists, this exhibit  will provide an opportunity for visitors to learn about the results  of this research and increase their own understanding of the earth  and the solar system in general.  The exhibit will introduce  visitors to the planets, their environmental characteristics,  potential and unlikely probability for life to exist on other  planets and the processes involved in astronomical research.  In  addition to the exhibit, they will develop a planetarium program,  materials for use by teachers and students, various workshops and  other programs for teachers and community leaders, and a full  marketing package for participating museums.  The exhibit will  travel to a minimum of nine museums during its three year tour  after opening at the Pacific Science Center in December, 1997.",
