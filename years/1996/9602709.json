 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Biology at California State University Northridge is the recipient of funds from the ARI Program to renovate and improve its plant sciences facilities.  Because of the antiquated nature of four greenhouses, a Head-house, and an Auxiliary building, faculty research projects have been severely hampered in recent years, and research training opportunities for undergraduates have been curtailed.  This has countermanded the long-standing goals of the institution to support faculty research, encourage excellence in the plant sciences while bringing expertise and insight to students, and encourage minority students for careers in the discipline.  Currently five faculty members, 10 graduate, and 11 undergraduate researchers are engaged in research at the facility.  Topics range from plant ecology and evolution to physiology.  In addition, the facility is used for research training in Plant Systematic, Plant Morphology, Field Botany, and Population and Community Ecology.  Within the four greenhouses, renovations will consist of updating the environmental systems and controls and plant laboratory fixtures. Overhead lighting fixtures will be updated to allow more supplemental light for plants.  A modern liquid fertilizer mixing and plumbing system will be installed in the Head-house and greenhouses, facilitating the upkeep of large collections of plant species. Benches and storage cabinets used for experiment set up in the Head-house will be updated to improve efficiency, and to allow access by physically challenged faculty and students.  The Auxiliary building will be renovated to provide a large controlled environmental growth chamber, which will allow large experiments to be conducted under precise lighting and temperature conditions.  With the environmental control problems resolved by the renovations, faculty will be able to conduct research at a level that is currently not feasible. It is anticipated that the number of students doing research will increase, as a result of improved research training and experiences, thus encouraging them to pursue graduate studies.",
