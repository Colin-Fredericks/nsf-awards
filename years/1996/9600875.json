 "awd_abstract_narration": "96-00875  Miller    The development of specific immune responses, such as generating antibodies, is an unique and fascinating aspect in the evolution of vertebrates. Immunology is an exciting area in biology for students and for the public, in general. This is caused in part by the daily reminders of new emerging diseases, such as the Ebola virus and Hantaviruses as well as the continuing AIDS epidemic. Most of what is known about the development and function of the immune system has been obtained from muridaes and from humans, little is known about the development of immunocompetence in other vertebrates. The objectives of the grant are to analyze immunological development at a molecular level in a model marsupial species, the short tailed opossum Monodelphis domestica. Immunocompetence in marsupials develops postnatally whereas in placental mammals this occurs early in the prenatal period. Little is known about the development of the immune response in marsupials. Toward understanding this process in marsupials, opossum genes that are apparently involved in lymphocyte development have been cloned and characterized and expression analysis of these genes during development has been initiated. This grant also outlines plans to integrate an active research program in comparative immunology that involves undergraduates and graduates as well as a research and educational program involving a local instructor and students at a nearby community college. This program is set in the unique environment created by the Albuquerque community and the University of New Mexico, which is one of the largest minority research institutions in the country. An important aspect of this educational plan is the use of this research project to foster an active collaboration with the biology faculty of the local community college.  %%%  The generation of antibodies in the immune response is an unique and fascinating aspect in the evolution of vertebrates. While much is known about the development and function of the immune  systems of murid rodents and of humans, little is known about the development of immunocompetence in other vertebrates. For example, how does immunocompetence develops in marsupials, which occurs postnatally, in contrast to development in placental mammals, which occurs early in the prenatal period? The educational component of this grant will foster an active collaboration with the biology faculty at the local community college. This collaboration will involve working with students, primarily minority, who enter four year University from the two year college without having been exposed to active research programs. Cross-institution course development is also providing exposure to research active faculty for these students.  ***",
