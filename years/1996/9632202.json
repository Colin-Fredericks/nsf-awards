 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. N. John Cooper, Department of Chemistry, University of Pittsburgh, is   supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of   the Chemistry Division for studies of highly reduced complexes of   manganese.  The primary objective of this project is to use the unusual   reactivity of a tetrahapto Mn(-I) benzene complex to develop new   reactions of arenes coordinated to transition metals.  The   electrophilicity of cationic reagents, such as the hexahapto Mn(I)   complex, iminium salts, and cationic cycloheptatrienyl complexes, will be   used to drive additions to the Mn(-I) complex.   These additions are   expected to produce new biaryl ligands, amino alkyl substituted ligands,   and 6:4:7 fused ring systems.  Fundamental studies of the mechanism and   the scope of these additions will be explored using ketenes, and   reactions with keteniminium salts will be tested to force entry into   (2+2) additions which lead to fusion of a 4-membered carbon ring on to   the benzene nucleus.  Strategies for the removal of the diene ligands   from the metal center will also be investigated.   The reactions proposed   share several characeristics which are likely to make them of strategic   value in organic synthesis; all involve formation of new C-C bonds to the   benzene nucleus, many introduce useful functional groups for synthesis,   all are likely to be stereospecific, and most should be accessible with   other substituents on the arene nucleus.   Benzene is one of the most central molecules in chemistry, and the   broader significance of the proposed ressarch is that it will lead to new   reactions of benzene which cannot be achieved through traditional organic   methods. These studies will shed new light on carbon-carbon bond forming   reactions to benzene, and the results are expected to be of general   utility to the field of organic synthesis.",
