 "awd_abstract_narration": "Network software is hard to design, implement, debug, and maintain. This  basic problem is compounded by heterogeneity and the need for high  performance.  Heterogeneity results in multiplying the amount of networking  software that must be developed and maintained. To improve performance,  networking software is often hand-crafted in an operating system kernel,  where software is particularly hard to debug and maintain.  Emerging  high-speed networking technology, coupled with next generation multimedia  applications, is resulting in increased demand for high performance and  extremely flexible networking software.  A fundamental theme of this  proposal is that advances in network software can only be achieved by an  approach that simultaneously considers programming ease, platform  diversity, and performance.    This proposal investigates the use of compiler technology to rapidly  prototype and automatically optimize complex protocol software.  The result  is network software that is easier to write, more portable, and more  maintainable.  Yet, with the appropriate automatic optimizations, the  performance of such implementations should compare favorably to the  performance of hand-crafted implementations.    The first part of our proposal concerns techniques for automatically  optimizing network software to achieve Gigabit link speeds.  This involves  inventing new optimization techniques (e.g., fusing together individual  message demultiplexing definitions into efficient demultiplexing code),  automating existing optimization paradigms (e.g., header prediction and  address caching), and extending existing work on automated optimization  techniques.  Our plans call for building on the existing theory underlying  optimizing compilers to unify various ad hoc techniques, and to provide a  point of departure for producing new optimization techniques.    The second part of our proposal involves a framework that integrates our  optimization techniques to support rapid prototyping of efficient  ne tworking software.  We enable protocol code to be developed without undue  attention paid to low-level wire data formats; operating system specific  mechanisms for demultiplexing, synchronization, or error handling.  This  allows an extremely compact protocol description that is then compiled and  optimized by our framework to a wide range of target environments.  These  environments include a simulator, application-level network interfaces, and  shared-memory multiprocessor platforms.",
