The ultimate goal of the   research effort is to assess ecological and water-system vulnerabilities to   potential changes in weather forcing, to changes in land use, and to changes   in regional water management practices. The Igua=E7u River region in   southern Brazil and the Alabama/Apalachicola/Savannah River region in the   United States have been selected for comparative purposes due to their   similar areal extent, land use, and climate responses to El Ni=F1o events.    Both regions have large reservoir projects with multiple objectives, such as   municipal and agricultural water supply, the production of hydropower, and   the preservation of water quality and local ecology.  A good network of   hydro-meteorological and agro-meteorological observing stations exists in   both regions with the capability of retrieving remotely sensed data.  These   conditions make possible the prediction of hydroclimatological variables   like rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, river flow, and estimated soil   water, which could then be used for inputs to regional distributed   hydrologic models that took into account local land-use and land-cover   patterns to produce local predictions of energy fluxes, soil water, and   surface and sub-surface runoff.  These types of predictions can be further   used in ecological models to assess impacts on ecosystems resulting from   climate variability, and are extremely useful for when estimating the   impacts and risks associated with natural variability and uncertainty in   water resources management models.  The multiple objectives of the water   management models would include in addition to hydroelectric power   production and urban water supply, agricultural objec tives and objectives   related to riverine ecosystem health.  This proposal brings together   participants from member countries of the Inter-American Institute for   Global Change Research (IAI), a U.S. initiative to stimulate cooperative   research on global change issues among the scientific institutions of the   Americas.  The NSF is the lead U.S. Government agency designated to carry   out U.S. responsibilities within the IAI.  %%%  The multi-disciplinary research proposal developed under this planning   grant will combine models of atmospheric variability, hydrology, and   ecology in order to assess optimal management practices for large reservoir   systems.
