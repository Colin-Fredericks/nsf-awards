 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Problem: The Paramount Unified School District is a microcosm  of the population of Los Angeles County, California, with a 90%  non-Asian minority population.  Fewer than 60 students out of a  graduating class of 400 go on to a four-year college and even fewer  major in mathematics or science.  The Solution:  Objectives. By  June 2001, at the end of the fifth year of implementation,  Paramount High School will have had 1,450 of its seniors complete  a college preparatory sequence (currently only 57 per year do so).   All of these graduates will have successfully progressed through  this project, Paths Toward Significant Achievement (PTSA) to  successfully complete precollege courses.  Subsequent years will  show even higher numbers of students who pass through the PTSA  pipeline.  Project Staff:  The Principal Investigator, the  Superintendent, and Project Co-Directors have a strong background  in successful educational project implementation and will be  responsible for the achievement of PTSA goals.   Participants/Activities:  The Advisory Committee will advise  participants in the design and implementation of the long-term,  systemic plan for K-12 to change the way science and math are  taught and learned in the District.  Five hundred teachers (90% of  District teachers) will participate in curriculum reform/enrichment  and teacher enhancement activities; they will learn how to motivate  students to enjoy and want to learn science and math through staff  development, peer coaching, and collaboration activities.  Teachers  will become more sensitive to the special problems of minorities,  Limited-English proficient students, and disabled students.  They  will help students set higher expectations using strategies adapted  from the successful program, Advancement Via Individual  Determination, AVID.  All 14,352 students will experience science  and math across the curriculum, participate in student enrichment  activities such as tutoring, summer school and intersession  courses, distance l earning, and keeping electronic portfolios.  The  quality and quantity of science and math instruction at the  elementary school (K-8) will \"hook\" children in the active pursuit  of mathematical and scientific knowledge.  At the ninth grade  school, students will link concrete learning acquired in elementary  school with the more abstract concepts and critical thinking  demands of high school science and math.  In high school (10-12),  students will attend rigorous science and math courses taught by  their high school teachers or college teachers within the context  of their career path through distance learning technology.  At all  levels they will be grouped into smaller groups called \"Families\"  as a safety net.  Community resources such as businesses, museums,  colleges, and other community partners will provide many types of  hands-on experiences and programs, including distance learning, to  stimulate and enhance science and math education.  Parents will  support children's math and science learning by promoting science  and math activities at home and in the community, leading family  discussions, monitoring homework, setting aside time for reading  and study, limiting television viewing, and encouraging their  children to take advanced science and math courses.  Cost the total  costs of program implementation and dissemination will be  $1,750,000 for five years.  Most of the costs will relate to  participant collaboration time in program and staff development as  well as the development and implementation of a significant array  of hands-on student enrichment activities entailing some equipment  and supply expenditures.  ***",
