 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research has as its goal the development of efficient, scalable and  portable algorithms that allow learning and limited reasoning over very  large repositories of data.  The goal is to combine these algorithms into  an environment that supports summarization of very large streams of data  (data mining) and  the drawing of reasonably accurate conclusions from  these summaries, using probabilistic reasoning where appropriate.   The  following areas are being investigated:    (1)  Efficient algorithms for reasoning in probabilistic networks;   (2)  Efficient induction of provably accurate generalized decision trees; and  (3)  Incorporating knowledge in memory-based reasoning methods.    Of particular interest are reasoning algorithms that perform queries and  updates to data extremely efficiently, perhaps in time which is sublinear  to the size of the original database, and learning algorithms that provide  performance guarantees on the accuracy of the answers by giving a  confidence rating with the answer to a query.  The availability of  high-speed, reliable, intelligent algorithms for learning and reasoning  from data will have important applications in digital libraries, medical  care, process control, and resource allocation, among other areas.",
