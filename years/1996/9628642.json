 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the design and analysis of communication receivers  for direct-sequence (DS) code-division multiple-access (CDMA) in an  environment consisting of multiple user interference where each signal is  received at possibly different strengths and in narrowband interference  (NBI) of unknown forms.  This work differs from the work of many other  researchers in that the initial focus here is put on the problem of  parameter estimation (i.e. synchronization) rather than data detection.  Traditionally synchronization has been the most difficult aspect in the  design of communication receivers.  An asymptotically maximum likelihood  parameter estimation scheme will be used which is based on colored noise  model rather than the usual white noise.  This makes the proposed  estimation scheme nicely suited for dealing with NBI.  Once the parameter  estimation problem has been thoroughly studied, the focus will turn to the  problem of multiuser receiver design in the presence of NBI.  The optimum  receiver for such an environment has been formulated and will be  investigated. Suboptimal structures that are robust to errors in needed  side information will also be studied.  Finally the project will address  the problem of multiuser receiver design when the form of the transmitted  signal is not precisely known, as when in CDMA overlay a spread transmitter  may have to distort its own signal in order to avoid interfering with a  nearby narrowband system..",
