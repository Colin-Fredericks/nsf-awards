 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for research on computer-aided process planning for four-axis computer numerical control (CNC) turning centers.  The presence of multiple-turrets and spindles in this new generation of CNC machines introduces process planning considerations and complexities that are non-existent in earlier machine tools.  The goal of this research is to investigate a hybrid process planning framework that integrates computer-intelligent decision-making along with interactive expert user input at various levels so that an optimal process plan can be identified quickly in a large combinatorial solution space.  This research will be done in close collaboration with industry and will entail: (1) formulation and development of representation schemes, algorithms and methods for process plan generation and optimization, and (2) demonstration and validation of the process planning technology by application on real industry data.  The process plan optimization problem that arises in the context of four-axis CNC turning centers is unique and does not match classical optimization problems.  A Tabu Search based optimization approach will be used.   Because of the lack of process planning systems for four-axis CNC turning centers, these highly flexible machines are being used in industry typically as dedicated machines for mass production of one or two parts.  The successful completion of this project could lead to the availability of a process planning system that would make it convenient to process a large variety of parts and thereby increase the acceptance and use of these machines in industry.  This in turn could enable companies to reduce their manufacturing lead times and enhance their responsiveness to customers and thereby become more competitive in the global marketplace.",
