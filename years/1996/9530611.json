 "awd_abstract_narration": "95-30611  MARRA    This research project is part of the US Joint Global Ocean Flux  Study (JGOFS) Southern Ocean Program aimed at (1) a better  understanding of the fluxes of carbon, both organic and  inorganic, in the Southern Ocean, (2) identifying the physical,  ecological and biogeochemical factors and processes which  regulate the magnitude and variability of these fluxes, and (3)  placing these fluxes into the context of the contemporary global  carbon cycle.      The Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) has had three  successful field efforts (North Atlantic, Equatorial Pacific,  Arabian Sea), and the next major field effort will be in the  Southern Ocean.  The overall objectives of JGOFS are to quantify  and understand processes controlling the time-varying fluxes of  carbon and associated biogenic elements, and to predict the  response of marine biogeochemical processes to climate change.  The Southern Ocean is critical to the global carbon cycle, as  judged by its size and the physical process which occur there  (e.g., deep and intermediate water formation), but its present  quantitative role is uncertain.    In order to address the objectives of USJGOFS successfully, the  measurement of primary production is required for all process  cruises planned for the Southern Ocean Study.  Three methods will  be employed: in situ incubations, deck incubations, and the  photosynthesis-irradiance response.  The areas of study will be  the continental shelf of the Ross Sea, and the Polar Front region  to the north of the Ross Sea.  The controls on photosynthesis  will also be investigated.  It is hypothesized that on the  continental shelf, irradiance limitation is the major factor  controlling phytoplankton productivity, whereas in the Polar  Front region, the availability of iron limits phytoplankton  growth and influences the size distribution of the populations.  The productivity data in conjunction with hydrographic data, will  form a large part of the Southern Ocean JGOFS database which bot h  at-sea investigators and modelers will use to clarify the role of  the Southern Ocean in the global carbon cycle.",
