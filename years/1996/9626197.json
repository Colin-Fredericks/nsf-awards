 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626197  Sauer       This research focuses on computational aspects of chaotic  dynamics, with emphasis on questions that have implications  across the sciences and engineering.  The first main area involves  the question of whether it is possible, even in principle, for  long-term computer simulations of typical nonhyperbolic chaotic  systems to approximately match true system behavior.  Part of this  research involves developing quantitative laws of the expected  waiting time between breakdowns, or mismatches, between computer  simulation trajectories and the trajectories of computer models.  The second major area is ongoing work by the investigator on the  interpretation of physical and biological experiments that  generate aperiodic time series.  Using univariate or multivariate  time series or inter-event time intervals produced by a  deterministic physical process, the phase space of the process  can be faithfully reconstructed as the basis for applications  such as system identification, filtering, prediction and control.  Topological and diffeomorphic embedding theorems guaranteeing  this in various physically verifiable contexts have been the  results of previous and ongoing research by the investigator and  coworkers.       Computer simulations are a staple of modern science.  National policy decisions are being made which rely partially on  the interpretation of long-term computer simulations of nonlinear  models.  The questions explored in the proposal are critical to  the analysis of simulations of nonlinear processes.  One goal of  this proposal is to explore these questions in physically  relevant models, and in particular to isolate and quantify the  limitations of these representations, especially for the purpose  of long-term modeling.  The second focus of this research is the  interpretation of data collected from chaotic systems in  experiments and nature.  Complex deterministic time series are  being identified in physical, chemical, engineering and  biological/medical setti ngs.  As an example, hippocampal slices  from mammals and other small neural systems are studied by the  investigator, in conjunction with a group of medical researchers  headed by a neurosurgeon specializing in epilepsy, with the  purpose of detecting deterministic information processing in the  brain.  The investigator has done previous work on expanding these  conceptual foundations and developing related computational  implementations, and works to widen their areas of validity and  increase their power for the study of complex systems in natural,  experimental, and engineering-related contexts.  New techniques  for these applications are developed in this project, involving  methods from numerical analysis used in conjunction with existing  signal processing methods.",
