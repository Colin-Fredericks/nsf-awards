Yet the role of communication in social  behavior remains controversial, in part because it has been  difficult to integrate information about the adaptive  significance of signaling for both senders and receivers  within the same system.  In the subsocial treehopper,  Umbonia crassicornis, communication between parents and  offspring plays a critical role in their response to  predation.  Females produce only a single clutch of young,  and thus there is a high overlap of interests between parent  and offspring about the extent of parental investment in  offspring defense.  The fitness costs and benefits of  signaling are therefore shared by both senders and  receivers.  This study will address the benefits of  signaling by quantifying the effectiveness of the parents   anti-predatory response, that is evoked by nymphal signals.  The costs of signaling will be addressed by manipulating  female investment in offspring defense, to determine whether  current benefits accrued by evoking parental defense are  offset by a reduction in parental survivorship and potential  for future defense.  The proposed research should be of  general interest within the fields of animal communication  and social evolution.",
