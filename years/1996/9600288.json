The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit which will support Dr. Pamela Beatrice to work with  Professor Costas G. Vayenas at the University of Patras in  Greece for six months and then return to the United States  to work with Professor Wayne L. Worrell at the University of  Pennsylvania for six months.        Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have potential for  simultaneous operation as both a generator od electrical  power and a chemical reactor for several industrially  important catalytic oxidation processes.  This project will  evaluate the electrocatalyic and catalytic properties of the  mixed electronically and ionically conducting yttria-titania-  zirconia materials which show great promise as an anode  material in SOFCs.  The materials have been developed and  evaluated for their ionic and electrical conducting  properties at the University of Pennsylvania under Professor  Worrell.  The study consists of two parts:  the first is the  electrocatalytic and catalytic evaluation to be made at the  University of Patras, with the help of Professor Vayenas,  and the second is a microstructural characterization to be  done at Penn with Professor Worrell.    ***",
