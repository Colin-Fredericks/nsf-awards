 "awd_abstract_narration": "A program of both research and teaching in physics will be  carried out.  The research, theoretical in nature, will pursue in  a variety of ways the possibility that the dark matter in the  universe-matter which is known to exist because of its  gravitational effects but which does not emit any light that  would make it visible - is composed of elementary particles  different from those already discovered in the laboratory.  Extensions of existing theory that may point to such new  particles will be pursued.  Methods for detecting the new  particles will be explored.  Models of the universe which contain  the new particles and/or other novel features will be studied.  The teaching will entail a number of innovations.  These include  allowing students in an introductory physics course to hone their  problem-solving skills by applying concepts they learn in class  to mechanical systems which they analyze, design, and build.  Also included is the creation of videotaped lectures for  distribution to universities in third-world countries.       The question of the nature of the dark matter is one of the  central issues in astrophysics, so the research addressing this  question will be very important.  Creative innovations in the  teaching of science to university students, both here and abroad  are of great importance to the healthy future of science and  society.",
