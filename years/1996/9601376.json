The  project will employ formal and rigorous mathematical  analysis, numerical analysis and scientific computation to  investigate dynamic phase transitions arising in many  important physical processes.  This research addresses an  important problem in modeling materials and processes.    Strengthening cooperation in mathematics and computation  sciences with China, which has a long tradition of  excellence in mathematics and a recent emphasis in  computational science, is important.  The Chinese Academy of  Sciences' Institute of Systems Science and the Mathematics  Institute at Fudan University are leading centers in China  in these fields, and collaboration among these researchers  should prove quite effective.",
