 "awd_abstract_narration": "9624966  Shen   This CAREER award will investigate the research issues associated with metrology in manufacturing science and technology, with emphasis on coordinate measuring machines (CMM).  It will enhance the manufacturing education program with the introduction of a geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) curriculum, complemented by a newly developed metrology laboratory.  The research objectives are to develop a methodology for assessing uncertainties in CMM measurements, so that compensation and sampling strategies can be designed to improve the accuracy and productivity of precision dimensional measurement.  Because competition demands precision products, the educational component's curriculum for metrology and GD&T is important for developing engineers with not only a quality focus, but with experience on how to achieve precision.  The principal investigator has a record of collaborating with the National Institute of Standards and Technology and Brown and Sharpe on precision metrology, and this collaboration will expand with this award.     This project shows innovation and collaboration in research and education.  Results from this work have the potential to increase the accuracy and productivity of coordinate measuring machines, and the educational component will enhance the human infrastructure needed to design and manufacture quality precision products.",
