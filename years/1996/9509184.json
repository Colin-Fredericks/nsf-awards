From the basic science perspective, plant ecology and evolution cannot be understood without knowledge of the causes of variation in plant reproductive success. From an applied perspective, plant reproduction is important because many of our agricultural products are the direct products of reproduction, seeds, and because understanding of reproductive success is   necessary to plant breeding programs. However, knowledge of plant reproduction has been limited because most current information is about success of plants as seed parents, even though plants reproduce both as seed and pollen parents.  If selection is occurring on the ability of plants to achieve reproductive success through pollen donation, then some of the features of plants may have misinterpreted or under-utilized.    This study focuses on testing whether selection is occurring on plants that act as pollen parents. An artificial selection experiment is used to address whether pollen donating ability is genetically based and to test whether selection on this ability alters other characteristics of plants. Wild radish has been chosen for  the model organism because it is very easy to work and is closely related to crucifers that are grown as crops. The study directly addresses a fundamental issue in plant evolutionary ecology and may have rather direct agricultural implications as well. Because it involves selecting seeds from different regions of the fruits the research will address whether this   form of selection could be useful in plant breeding. A study of alfalfa has already shown that seeds selected from different regions of fruits have different growth and reproductive characteristics.  This project can be used to address whether the most vigorous seeds typically come from particular regions of fruits in an unrelated plant and thus whether this might be a generally useful method of selection in plant breeding programs.",
