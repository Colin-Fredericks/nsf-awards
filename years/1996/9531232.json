 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. James A. Ibers, Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, is   supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of   the Chemistry Division for research into soluble metal selenides and   tellurides. The objective of the project is to develop the chemistry of   metal-selenium and tellurium anionic clusters, species which are known to   differ markedly from corresponding metal-sulfides. Varied synthetic   techniques, which are based on the reactions of metal compounds with   polyselenides  or polytellurides in  non-aqueous solvents, on   chalcogenide substitution reactions, and on reduction of metal   chalcogenides by alkali metals in liquid ammonia, will be designed. The   compounds will be characterized by selenium and tellurium nmr and by   x-ray diffraction.  Selenium and tellurium, often combined with small amounts of other   metals, are widely used as components in semiconductors and other   advanced materials. In this project new routes will be developed for the   preparation of substances composed of several selenium or tellurium atoms   and one or a few metal atoms. These 'clusters' will be designed to bear   an electrical charge, which will result in their being soluble in various   solvents. As such they may find use in the formation of new electronic   substances.",
