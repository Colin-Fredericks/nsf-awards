 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630610  Kundrot  Ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules play a myriad of roles in the life cycles of cells and viruses that require RNA to adopt well-defined three dimensional structures.  The long term goal of this project is to understand how the structure of an RNA allows it to perform its biological function.  The immediate goal is to understand how the structures of two types of RNA molecules dictate their functional properties.  The first molecule is called a pseudoknot and it is closely related to pseudoknots that cause ribosomes to shift reading frames when making proteins from messenger RNA.  Professor Kundrot and his colleagues will determine the x-ray crystal structure of this pseudoknot.  The second type of RNA molecule studies in this proposal contains unusual, or non-canonical UU base-pairs within a duplex.  These types of base-pairs are very common in RNAs.  This work will explore the conformational flexibility of a dodecamer containing tandem non-canonical UU base-pairs by high resolution X-ray crystallography and will also conduct crystallographic studies of other non-canonical base pairs in the context of dodecamer sequences.  %%%  RNA is a molecule found in cells and viruses that carries genetic information and that catalyzes biochemical reactions.  The goal is to determine the three dimensional structure of RNAs from diverse systems and connect their functional properties to the underlying structure.  While thousands of high resolution, three dimensional protein structures are known, less than twenty RNA structures have been determined.  This work will examine the structure of two different types of RNA molecules.  The results will be helpful in understanding protein-RNA interactions, ribosomal frame-shifting, non-canonical base pairing and ribozyme catalysis.  It will provide insights into how two types of RNA molecules function in cells and viruses.  ***",
