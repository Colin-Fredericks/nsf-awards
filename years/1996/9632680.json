 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632680  McMillan    This project is designed to capitalize on (i) the existence of an  unusually large number of productive neuroscientists at a public  university in a rural state as well as faculty in the Departments  of Mathematical Sciences and Computer Science whose work relates to  neuroscience and (ii) the desire of a group of well-known  computational neuroscientists at prestigious institutions  throughout the country, as well as in Europe, to establish a  literal and virtual collaboratory that will facilitate their  ability to exchange ideas as well as to share facilities. The  primary goal (1-5 years) of the project is to establish an  Institute of Computational Neuroscience at Montana State  University-Bozeman (MSU). In addition to the neuroscientists  already at MSU, the institute will, at least for the first few  years, consist of two new on-site faculty members and five  affiliate members. The affiliates will spend significant time at  MSU each year and will develop a network to enhance their  collaborative interactions when they are at their home  institutions. A long term goal will include efforts to recruit as  many affiliates as possible to become resident members of the  institute.",
