 "awd_abstract_narration": "9634015   Barsoum    In the proposed project, the superconducting characteristics  of the ternary compounds known as O312sO and OH-phasesO will  be studied.  The materials have the formula M13M2C2, where  M1 is from groups IIIa, IVa, Va, or VIa, and M2 is from  groups IIIb, IVb, or Vb.  A typical composition is Ti3SiC2.  The PIOs group has fabricated dense, single phase samples  and studied their atomic structure and properties.  These  ternary compounds share three properties with high Tc  cuprate superconductors.  Their atomic structure is layered,  their conductivity at room temperature is very high, and  their resistivity decreases with decreasing temperature.  Because of these similarities, there is a possibility that  these materials might also be superconducting.  Samples of a  variety of 312Os and H-phases will be characterized at  temperatures ranging from 4.2 to 300K by four-probe dc  resistivity, Hall effect, ac-susceptibility, magnetization  and field-induced microwave absorption.  %%%  The proposed SGER project will study the superconducting  characteristics of a group of unusual compounds, which  potentially might be a new class of high Tc superconductors.  ***",
