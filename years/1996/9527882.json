 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program is supporting a   research  effort where a hybrid electronic structure technique will be developed by   Prof.  E.A. Carter of UCLA that first utilizes density functional theory to   obtain an  accurate electron density distribution for a metal, which then is used   (along  with its corresponding orbital representation) to provide a set of   Coulomb and  exchange operators that describe the interaction of the infinite metal   surface  and bulk crystal with a chemisorption region (composed of a few metal   atoms and  an adsorbed molecule).  The chemisorption region is then described using   a local  multireference configuration interaction method in the presence of the   embedding  Coulomb and exchange field derived from density functional theory.  The   goal is  to develop and test this hybrid DFT/CI method, with the hope that it will  provide the most accurate means yet of studying chemisorption on metal   surfaces  from first principles theories.  A new theory involving a mixture of quantum chemistry and solid state   physics  techniques will be developed.  The theory utilizes quantum physics known   for its  accuracy in describing metals and quantum chemistry known for its   accuracy in  describing metal-molecule chemical bonds.  These taken together are   expected to  provide the most accurate means yet of modelling chemical reactions that   occur  on metal surfaces.  Many important industrial technologies rely on such  reactions and it is hoped that the new theory will help optimize such  technologies further.",
