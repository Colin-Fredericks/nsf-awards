 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oswald  9630777    Information in the brain is transmitted from one nerve cell to  another by the release of a messenger molecule from the presynaptic  cell which diffuses across the small space and interacts with a  protein imbedded in the membrane of the postsynaptic cell called a  receptor.  Glutamate is the most prevalent excitatory  neurotransmitter in the brain.  The receptors for glutamate bind  the amino acid, and respond by opening a channel between the  outside of the cell and the inside of the cell allowing positively  charged ions to flow across the cell membrane.  Dr. Oswald is  characterizing the topology of the glutamate receptor and has found  the receptors to be similar in structure to bacterial proteins  which have similar functions.  The evolution of these molecules  could help understand the mechanisms cells use to communicate.   Studies are continuing to understand the mechanisms of glutamate  binding to this receptor.  These investigations will yield novel  data on the structure and function of glutamate receptors in the  brain and are important to understand adaptive mechanisms that have  been borrowed from simple organisms for use in higher species  during evolution.  In addition, these studies may provide the first  information about the molecular basis for learning and memory.",
