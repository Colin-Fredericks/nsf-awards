The project will involve all 200 of the district's teachers of mathematics in 10 days of teacher enhancement in each of the 3 years.  It will focus on deepening teachers' understanding of mathematics,  help them view mathematics as a problem solving discipline, enhance their pedagogical repertoire, and promote cross-grade dialogue to make K-12 mathematics instruction an integrated whole.  The enhancement will include preparing teachers to choose curriculum materials wisely.  Administrators and parents are involved in the program, and local industries and universities will provide volunteers to substitute for teachers while they attend professional development.  The district reform model will be disseminated through the production of a manual describing the project with suggestions for adaptations by other small-city districts.  Cost-sharing is reported at 144%.",
