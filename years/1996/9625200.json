 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625200  Hu       This CAREER award is to develop methods that reduce variation in sheet metal assembly and joining, and an educational plan of curriculum and laboratory development.  The technical approach to minimize variations in sheet metal assembly will: (1) develop a generic simulation model of the sheet metal assembly process that takes into account compliance of the sheet, (2) model the resistance welding process so its effects can be included, and (3) develop a robust design criterion that can assess the quality of sheet metal assembly processes.  The educational plan will team the investigator and his colleagues as they develop a unique curriculum for both traditional and non-traditional students on automotive assembly engineering.  Mentoring and outreach to underrepresented minorities, both through industrial projects and in collaboration with Focus:  Hope in Detroit, will be complemented by the development of a laboratory for assembly and joining that will be used for teaching and research.       The success of this project will generate new knowledge and methodologies that produce higher quality sheet metal assemblies.  This will impact industries such as automotive, aerospace, furniture and appliances,  making their products more competitive  because of improved quality and lower cost.",
