Drs. Franziskonis and Meisner will work with  Professor Eiichiro Tsuchida, professor in the Department of  Engineering at Saitama University, on a research project  entitled, \"Mechanics of Failure in Metal Matrix Composites.\"    The proposed research will consist of basic research to  determine the fundamental  factors governing the reliability of continuous fiber, metal  matrix composites in aggressive, high temperature  environments.  Analysis will focus on certain metal matrix  composites containing ductile metallic fiber-matrix  interface layers.  The principal modeled subject materials  will be various phases blended titanium aluminide  matrices reinforced with continuous fibers.  Variables such  as having ductile interface layers of refractory or noble  metals will be modeled and investigated.    The topics being investigated are currently relevant to the  scientific community and the benefits to be obtained from  collaborative research valuable.  The Experimental Center  for Engineering Materials at Saitama University and the  Composite and Heterogeneous Materials Center at the  University of Arizona are both excellent research facilities  and their cooperation on this project -- considered by both  parties to be the initial stage of a long term partnership -  - will likely yield results for both the United States and  Japan as well as the international scientific community as a  whole.  ***",
