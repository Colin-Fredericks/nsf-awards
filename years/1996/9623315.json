Basic studies of  the phonons of group IV materials will be performed by interference  enhanced Raman scattering (IERS) methods on ultrathin films of very  small, 1-2nm, nanocrystallites and on ultrathin films epitaxial layers  grown on selected crystalline oxides.  The results will provide new  information about the phonon states of very small crystallites,  without chemisorbed species, and ultrathin crystalline semiconductor  layers.  For epitaxial layers the distinct surface geometry, such as  the role of surface dimers and dangling bonds on Raman scattering are  of interest.  IERS will provide additional Information about  interfacial bonding in semiconductor/oxide interfaces.  The influence  of adsorbate atoms on the phonon states of nanoscale systems will be  studied.  Raman scattering will be expanded as a tool for the study of  surface and near surface atom dynamics and structure.  Complementary  specular, dipolar electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) research in  Si, Ge and C nanoscale systems will provide information about  interband electronic transitions with decreasing  size or film  thickness, about changes in the optical gap and subgap states, and the  effects of chemisorbed species.  Changes in the vibrational states of  near  surface atoms in amorphous diamond-like carbon materials  prepared by pulsed laser deposition will be studied by high resolution  EELS.  These in situ measurements of diamond-like films will allow a  means to increase 4-fold bonding in ultrathin and thin films.  %%%  As the size of condensed matter systems is reduced in one or more  dimensions to nanoscale levels, surface and near surface atoms play an  increasingly important role in determining physical and chemical  properties.  Thus electrons and phonon states, magnetic and optical  properties are su bstantially influenced when dimensions decrease to a  scale of 1-2nm.  In such systems finite size quantum effects and the  presence of new bonding geometries lead to very substantial changes in  physical properties.  Both basic scientific knowledge and potential  technological applications of such small scale systems are thus of  considerable current interest.  Different classes of nanoscale systems  will be studied to obtain information on the effects of finite size  and near surface atoms on both the vibrational states and electronic  interband transitions.  These studies will involve the use and  extension of new and developing experimental methods for studies of  both ordered and disordered nanoscale systems.  Improvements in  bilayer interference enhanced Raman scattering (IERS) methods for  ultrathin films in the form of nanocrystalline island particles and  epitaxial layers will enhance Raman scattering as a surface science  tool for ultrathin semiconductors and their interfaces.  In addition,  reflection electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) will be utilized  for new interband electronic state studies of nanocrystalline,  amorphous and epitaxial ultrathin  films.  These studies of ordered  and disordered nanoscale semiconductors will employ ultrathin films  deposited and studied in situ in a specialized uhv system.  ***",
