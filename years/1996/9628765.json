 "awd_abstract_narration": "Webster, James W  U of Georgia   This proposal examines late quaternary climatic variation within the Maya Lowlands, Belize as evidenced by variations in speleothem deposition.  Currently available paleoclimatic records for the Maya Lowlands of Central America are inadequate because detailed paleoclimate proxy data are difficult to obtain in humid, tropical areas.  Speleothems are thought to be a source of high resolution paleoclimate data.  The aims of the research are to examine speleothems as a source of paleoclimate proxy data and construct a regional, high resolution proxy record of climatic variation for up to 2000 years B.P.  In addition, an attempt will be made to establish whether climate variation may have contributed to the decline of the Mayan civilization.  Such results may allow prediction of future climate fluctuations for the region.  Speleothems from the study area will examined petrographically and by digital image analysis.  Spectral methods will then be used to analyze the observed record and compare it with existing climate data.  The research is significant because it is the first high-resolution record of paleoclimate for Central America.  The results will contribute to our understanding of the Maya collapse and add to the growing body of knowledge concerning speleothems in climate research.",
