In the early 1990's difficult  techniques were developed and used by the principal investigator   and others to prove sharp statements about the computations  and structure of the Donaldson invariants (which were introduced in  1984).  The October 1994 introduction of the brilliantly conceived  and more easily handled Seiberg-Witten invariants has made clear  the role of these Donaldson invariants in the study of smooth  4-manifolds.  Now that the dust has begun to settle, it is time to  review our understanding of smooth 4-manifolds.  Surprisingly, most  of the questions and problems related to the topology of smooth  4-manifolds present in September 1994 remain open.  In particular,  we still do not know how to classify simply-connected smooth  4-manifolds.  The first part of this project is to determine the  fundamental building blocks and to determine the operations  performed on these building blocks to recover any given smooth  4-manifold.  As a focal point, given a simply-connected irreducible  smooth 4-manifold X, does there exist a finite collection of  complex surfaces, each of which carries a pencil of curves from  which X is obtained by using the following three operations: (1) fiber  sum along a general fiber of the pencils; (2) local fiber sum  along tori of square zero; (3) performing a topological log  transform on tori of square zero?  The second part of this project  is to determine the effectiveness of the Seiberg-Witten and  Donaldson invariants.  In particular, does the deformation type of  a complex surface determine its diffeomorphism type?  This project  will begin to focus on explicit examples (the Horikawa surfaces)  that have the same Seiberg-Witten and Donaldson invariants, are  known to be deformation inequivalent (i.e., not the same as complex  manifolds), but are not known to be diffeomorphic.  One disturbing  feature of the Seiberg-Witten and  Donaldson invariants is that they  are defined only for manifolds for which the sum of its signature  and Euler characteristic is divisible by an odd multiple of 4.  The  final part of this project will focus on those simply-connected  4-manifolds for which the sum of the signature and Euler  characteristic is divisible by an even multiple of 4, and about  which virtually nothing is known.       At bottom, this project centers on the classification of objects  that are locally modeled on 4-dimensional Euclidean space and upon  which one can do differential calculus for real-valued functions.     These objects are the so-called smooth four-dimensional manifolds.    The basic technique is to extract algebraic topological data   from the solution space on these manifolds of partial   differential equations that arise in theoretical physics,  i.e., to use gauge-theoretic techniques.  It is known that one  cannot expect simply to give a complete list of smooth 4-manifolds.   However, one can expect to determine classifiable fundamental  objects and a list of operations that one can perform on these  objects in order to obtain any smooth 4-manifold.  It is the goal  of this project to provide these building blocks and assembly  rules.  Further, the behavior under these operations of known and  future invariants of smooth 4-manifolds should be easily determined.    Success of the project will create another strong tie between  topology and theoretical physics, partly because, as noted above, the   topological tools involved come from gauge theory, i.e., from quantum   mechanics, and partly because any light shed on 4-manifolds bears on   our understanding of the 4-dimensional space-time of relativity theory.  ***",
