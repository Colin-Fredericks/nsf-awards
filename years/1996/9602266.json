 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a new, multidisciplinary  research training program focused on understanding  the biological implications of small population  size.  A group of 18 faculty from the Departments of  Zoology, Plant Biology and Entomology at the  University of Maryland have joined with 5 colleagues  from research units of the Smithsonian Institution  to develop a novel training program for  undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students  that integrates studies of  population and community  ecology, genetics, evolution, and social behavior in  the context of small populations.  Because small,  reproductively isolated populations are an  increasingly common feature of the natural  distribution of many wild plants and animals, such  studies will both provide important understanding of  basic processes in biology and, at the same time,  lead to knowledge useful in conservation biology and  in the preservation of wild and captive endangered  species.  Undergraduate trainees will pursue a year-  long research project and participate in seminars,  journal clubs and technical workshops aimed at all  trainee levels.  Graduate students will follow a  core curriculum of existing and new courses  developed for the RTG, as well as a required year-  long focused seminar leading to an intensive 3-day  annual meeting.  During the meeting, leading experts  will meet in lecture and discussion with the  trainees.  The technical workshops and optional  summer research internships will benefit from  Smithsonian Institution laboratories and field  research sites.  A novel feature of required  training will be a course on race, gender and  scientific knowledge taught by one of the RTG  faculty.  Graduate and postdoctoral research  projects will emphasize integration of multiple  disciplines and are expected to benefit from the  participation of two faculty mentors.  ***",
