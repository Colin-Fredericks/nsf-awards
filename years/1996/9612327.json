 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612327  Mistree   The integration of at least three distinct design areas in manufacturing  organizations will be investigated, namely, product design, manufacturing process design, and design  of the organization itself.  Historically these activities have been carried out in relative  isolation, by separate people on different timelines.  The following research questions will be  addressed:  (1) How can a unified and mathematically rigorous approach be implemented for designing  products, manufacturing processes, and the organization   itself?  (2) How can the design of these  interdependent entities be integrated and connected along a single design timeline? (3) How can the  strategic actions of many competitive and/or collaborative players be modeled in a rigorous and  quantitative design environment?  (4) How can management strategy and policy be designed in the face  of such competitive and collaborative forces?  Answers to these questions will be built on  applications of systems theory to product design and a rigorous mathematical implementation of game  theory.   If successful, this research will facilitate integrated product and process development of  designed-to-order and made-to-order systems, and it will impact materiel acquisition in both the  commercial and defense sectors.  This will have the benefit of achieving more effective utilization of  resources and quicker response to customer   orders.",
