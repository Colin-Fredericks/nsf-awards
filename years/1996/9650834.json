 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project introduces modern nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy into the undergraduate curriculum. The new Fourier-transform-NMR instrument is being integrated into several upper-level courses for chemistry majors and minors. In the instrumental analysis laboratory course, a new experiment has been planned to introduce students to the concepts and techniques of FT-NMR. Among the techniques included are homonuclear decoupling, gated decoupling and spin lattice relaxation time measurement by the inversion recovery method. In the organic chemistry laboratory course, the use of NMR is greatly increased, and modern methods are introduced. In the advanced physical chemistry laboratory course, an NMR component is being added as a second method of analysis for an experiment currently in the curriculum.   The instrument can also be used as part of an ongoing series of workshops that introduce analytical methods to high school teachers and students.",
