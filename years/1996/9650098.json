 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a computerized mapping facility  for use by undergraduate students.  For geology students to be competitive in the job market or in applications to graduate school, they must be computer literate. Formal coursework in computer basics is not sufficient. Students must be exposed to extensive practical, hands-on, experience to increase their expertise and to facilitate their transition from a student to a professional setting. The use of computers and Global Positioning System (GPS) mapping in the context of geology field camp provides an ideal opportunity for students to apply their computer knowledge in an environment that closely approximates that of the job market. This project applies computer and GPS technology to stratigraphic analysis (the preparation of columnar sections and cross sections), structural geology problems (rose diagrams, stereo nets, cross sections), map problems (location of data points and the transfer of information from field observations to finished maps), plotting, and report writing. The equipment used in this project can also be used in other departmental courses. The basic thrust of this enhancement is the shift from hand drawn to computer graphics and acquisition of GPS mapping techniques.",
