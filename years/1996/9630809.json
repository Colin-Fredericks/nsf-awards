 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630809  Dickerson  The goal of this project is to understand the molecular  mechanism of two-component regulatory systems of genetic  expression, using the NarQ/NarX/NarL/ NarP system that  controls nitrate respiration in bacteria.  In this system,  NarQ and NarX proteins sense the presence of nitrate or  nitrite in the surrounding environment, and activate  response regulator molecules NarL or NarP by  phosphorylating a particular aspartic acid. The activated  response regulators then bind to specific sites on DNA,  turning genes on and off as appropriate.  The project has  begun with a successful crystal structure analysis of NarL.  Further projects planned are: (1) Completion of the NarL  structure in a different crystal environment, to examine  crystal environment effect; (2) X-ray structure analysis of  the similar but independently-acting NarP; (3) Structure  analysis of the DNA-binding C-terminal domain of NarL in a  complex with its recognition sequence of DNA; (4)  Examination of constitutive mutants of NarL and NarP that  resist dephosphorylation and bind strongly to DNA; and (5)  X-ray analysis of full NarL/DNA and NarP/DNA complexes.  ***  The significance of this study is that it will be the first  systematic investigation at the molecular level of a two  component sensor/response system, with results applicable  to the broad evolutionary range of bacterial two-component  control systems.  It will also shed light on multi-  component genetic control systems in higher organisms, that  also act by phosphorylating key effector proteins.  Taken  together the NarQ/NarX/NarL/NarP family comprises a complex  but flexible control system that can adjust the relative  expression of several genes in response to the relative  concentrations of nitrate and nitrite.  The full logic  behind this four-component example of  a molecular response  network is not yet understood.  An increased understanding  of how it works and why it  must be so complex is the major  goal of this project.  %%%",
