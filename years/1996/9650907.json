 "awd_abstract_narration": "Opportunities for enhancing undergraduate education in geosciences through a range of computer-based technologies are growing rapidly. These opportunities include models and visualizations of processes that take place at large space or time scales, maps and satellite imagery, digitizers, large databases, and software for data analysis. The objective of this project is to significantly improve the education provided by increasing capabilities to incorporate these opportunities in courses for general education students and undergraduate majors in geology, hydrology, earth sciences, earth sciences teaching, and ultimately an emerging marine sciences curriculum. To accomplish this, the project will provide funds for the purchase of 16 personal computers that are being installed in a computer classroom and linked into the department and university networks and the Internet, along with basic software to run the applications identified.",
