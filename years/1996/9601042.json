An important facet of the biology of insects that accounts for their remarkable abundance and diversity is their ability to respond genetically to novel environmental challenges, be they natural or man made (e.g., pesticides).  This ability is predicated in part on the extent to which females of a wide variety of species retain control of gamete transfer and usage, and thereby influence the paternity and genetic makeup of their  offspring.  But what characteristics of males influence this cryptic selection process by female insects, and how do offspring benefit from their particular genetic endowments:  The proposal seeks to understand those aspects of the reproductive physiology and behavior of female insects that leads to increased survival and fitness of offspring.  Although an understanding of these reproductive processes has obvious practical ramifications for the management and control of insects, they also address important biological hypotheses concerning the coexistence of male traits and female reproductive processes.  One hypothesis proposes that certain male traits arise because they exploit built-in sensory biases of females.  A competing hypothesis suggests that male traits arise because they accurately signal a male's genetic makeup.  These hypotheses will be tested through experimental exploitation of female sensory makeup.  These hypotheses will be tested through experimental exploitation of female sensory capabilities, and by examining the reproductive success of females whose offspring have been sired by different males and hence, differ in their genetic makeup.",
