 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600611  Nowak    This U.S.-Poland Workshop on Concrete Structures will be  conducted by Dr. Andrzej Nowak of the University of Michigan and  Professor Michal Knauff of the Politechnika Warszawska (Warsaw  University of Technology).  The objective of the workshop is to  review the current analytical methods and technology in analysis,  design, evaluation, repair and rehabilitation of concrete  structures used in Poland and identify the most suitable topics  for joint research projects.  The major areas to be covered  include: (1) development of load and resistance models for  reinforced concrete and prestressed concrete structures; (2)  advanced materials (high strength/high-performance concrete,  composites, fiber-reinforced concrete); (3) diagnostic procedures  (tests, performance monitors, nondestructive techniques, signal  processing, integrated sensor systems, microwave, acoustic and  optical techniques); and (4) materials and techniques for repair  and rehabilitation of concrete structures (reinforced and  prestressed concrete, new composite materials).  Accordingly the  workshop will attempt to review state of the art summary of main  topics as viewed in each country,  identify the research needs,  in particular topics for cooperative projects; and derive some  recommendations that reflect the needs in manpower, technology  transfer and education for the near future.      This workshop in civil engineering fulfills the program  objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and  Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas  of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of  equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.  ***",
