 "awd_abstract_narration": "9527986  Molofsky   Ecologists are increasingly called upon to develop predictive models about how the effects of human-induced changes in the environment will affect the future performance of populations and communities.  Although simple mathematical models are often used as a basis for such predictions, we know very little about the relationship between the qualitative predictions of these models and the behavior of real populations.  However, given the limited resources available to ecologists, it will be impossible to construct realistically detailed models for all situations.  Thus, one of the most critical tasks facing ecologists today is to determine when (if ever) the predictions of simple models adequately reflect the effects of changes in environmental conditions.  Research funded by this award addresses that goal by testing whether simple population models adequately predict changes in abundance for populations of an annual plant (Cardamine pensylvanica) grown over multiple generations under controlled environment conditions.  By experimentally manipulating environmental conditions and monitoring long-term population dynamics, we will be able to test whether the mathematically general predictions of simple models capture ecologically general features of population dynamics.     Experiments will allow us to propose conditions for which simple models should or should not be able to capture important aspects of plant population dynamics in a variety of natural and experimental settings.  Findings will have implications for environmental planners, conservation biologists, and natural resource ecologists involved in modelling effects of anthropogenic perturbations and natural disasters on plant populations.",
