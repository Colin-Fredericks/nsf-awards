Field-based investigations will focus on the little-studied Kangmar dome and unstudied Lhagoi Kangri dome.  Integrated investigations include geologic mapping, structural, kinematic, geochronologic, and thermochronologic investigations within these two domes to document the geometry, kinematics direction, and magnitude of ductile and brittle deformation, the relative timing between pluton emplacement and deformation, and the age of intrusions, ductile deformation and fault motions.  These data, integrated with ongoing seismic reflection data by other workers, provide an opportunity to document the space-time evolution of gneiss dome formation within an overall lithospheric convergent setting.  The processes that lead to their creation have important implications for the tectonic evolution f the Tib etan plateau.  Therefore, an accurate characterization of the development of these gneiss domes in terms of their structural, kinematic, and temporal evolution will have significant implications for the formation of overthickened crust and perhaps the timing that high  elevations were achieved on the Tibetan plateau.   This project provides an excellent opportunity for structural geologists and geochronologists from the USA and China to collaborate on an integrated field and analytical research project that addresses fundamental questions about processes of gneiss dome formation in a continent-continent collisional tectonic setting.                          ;                                          Oh     +'  0                                       $       H       l                                               D       h                                                   R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       9526684                             Felicia Smith                       Felicia Smith               @         S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   *                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       @                                   @                                                                                                           @                                           Microsoft Word 6.0                                                      2                                                                                       ;                                                                                                                                          e =       e                   D                                                           j       j   j       j       j       j       j                                                                           1                                                                           !       !       !       @               l           T       5                           j                                                                                         j       j                                                                       j               j                                       ~               j       j       j       j                           w                                                                                                 9526861 Lee  An integrated geological investigation, to be completed in collaboration with Professor Chen, Wenji and Dr. Hao Jie, Institute of Geology, State Seismological Bureau, Beijing, China, is proposed to test and refine postulated mechanisms for the formation of the gneiss domes in southern Tibet.
