 "awd_abstract_narration": "9628549  Johnson   During the Mesozoic a well developed continental magmatic arc was active along the Pacific margin of the U.S., which by late Cretaceous to early tertiary time became fragmented and extensively rearranged by the development of extensional collapse and San Andreas transform faulting. The Salinian Black is a displaced and distinded fragment of the central link of this arc. The Gualala Basin contains late cretaceous -early tertiary conglomerates related to this fragmentation, thus provides an opportunity to help track tectonic blocks of arc rocks by examining  affinities of the basin's cobbles and conglomerates. This work is to use modern isotopic analysis to establish lithologic and temporal links between cobbles in the Gualala Basin and proposal source terranes. Definitive correlation's produced would be valuable in dueriminating between the several extant models for the collapse and fragmentation of this arc.",
