Dendy Sloan  Colorado School of Mines      A new state-of-the-art for hydrate experiments is proposed by demonstrating measurements of the hydrate phase structure and composition, using Raman spectroscopy.  The work will have two major impacts:    1. The hydrate structure is virtually never measured but predicted.  There are multiple  instances in which the incorrect hydrate structure has been predicted.  With at least  three common hydrate structures, the incorrect structure (and associated formation  conditions) is predicted more frequently than commonly realized.  We intend the  proposed work to demonstrate how this problem may be corrected.    2. The hydrate phase composition (both the guest-to-host ratio and guest-to-guest  composition) is also predicted rather than measured.  However, such  measurements are necessary to correct the existing thermodynamic model since  hydrate formation conditions depend not only on structure but also on the phase  composition.",
