 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Biological Sciences is one of the premier departments at the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC).  The undergraduate research experience, particularly in the sciences, has been identified as an institutional priority.  In addition, plans have been developed to focus efforts on a small group of programs at the graduate level, including programs in Biology.  Programs encompass a wide breath of research and training with foci in Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology; Neurobiology; and Ecology and Environmental Biology.  Ensuring the quality of undergraduate and graduate research programs in the department is instrumental to the success of the University's goals.  However, quality is threatened by the Department's occupancy of an antiquated structure that was never designed as a research facility.  Having the distinction of being the oldest building on campus,  many of the mechanical systems, such as HVAC,  plumbing, and electrical,  are outdated and have reached their functional life span.  Laboratories in their existing configuration cannot accommodate changes in programs or research thrusts without major modifications to the facility.  Because of poor ventilation, and the lack of a dedicated instrumentation room, equipment is stored in the main corridor, obstructing passage to other rooms.   As part of the comprehensive renovation plan, NSF funds will be used to renovate existing research and research training laboratories.  Renovations will include:  a complete overhaul of the building's utility systems, replacement of fixed equipment,  and the creation of research support rooms. Modular research labs, the renovation's  key feature, will increase training opportunities, expand program flexibility, and facilitate communication and research collaborations.   As the most culturally diverse of all the Maryland colleges and universities, many under-represented minorities are encouraged and given opportunities to pursue advanced studies in the sciences, which is evident by the success of the Meyerhoff Scholarship Program.  This Program is designed to recruit and retain minority students that demonstrate an aptitude and interest in science and technology.  Renovation of the facility is vital to the continual training of scientists for the 21st century and to the realization of UMBC's goal to become a top public research institution.",
