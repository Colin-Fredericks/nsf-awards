Each of the co-organizers, T.E.S.  Raghavan and T. Parthasarathy, are responsible  for having developed important centers for game  theory research at their respective  institutions, the University of Illinois at  Chicago and the Indian Statistical Institute.   This year is notable, with the  Nobel Prize in  economics having been awarded to three  distinguished game theorists for their  contribution to understanding economies as  models of non-cooperative games.      One of the main thrusts of the conference will  be the recent developments on equilibrium  selection and economic models of games with  incomplete information in bargaining, auctions  and competitive bidding.    Scope:  Game theory is an area in which there  is a strong basis for collaborative research  between Indian and US mathematicians and  economists.  This workshop will build on the  accomplishments of a highly successful game  theory conference that was supported by INT  just over five years ago.  It will focus on the  major advances in the analysis of strategic  behavior embodied in the theory of games.   India's Finance Minister, the Honorable  Manmohan Singh, and operations researchers from  US multinational corporations located in India  will report on problems particular to the  Indian setting that can be studied from a game  theoretic perspective.   ***                        /",
