 "awd_abstract_narration": "9624268  Szleifer    Vesicles and liposomes are aggregates formed by spherically closed bilayers of amphiphilic molecules.  The ability of the lipsome to dissolve large quantities of molecules in their core and its solubility in aqueous environments makes them ideal systems for drug delivery.  In recent years it was found that grafting polymers to the surface of the liposomes increases the longevity of these aggregates in the blood stream.  Furthermore, by chemically modifying the grafted polymer free end-group with molecules that have large affinities to specific cell receptors, the liposomes can be used for targeted delivery.  Despite the importance of polymer-modified liposomes as premier drug carriers, there is no systematic understanding of the factors that govern their stability, longevity, and ability to target specific cells.    A systematic theoretical study of the behavior of liposomes and vesicles modified by grafted polymer chairs will be performed.  The single-chain mean-field theory will be used to study the behavior of the chain molecules (surfactants and polymers) that comprise the aggregates.  This approach provides accurate conformational and thermodynamic information as compared with experimental measurements.  The aim of the work is to systematically study the conditions under which modified aggregates can achieve longevity, thermodynamic stability  and specific targeting.  The work consists of finding the compositions of surfactants ( or lipids), cholesterol and polymer that will form stable vesicles within a range of size that is optimal for drug delivery.  The ability of the grafted chains to prevent protein adsorption on the surface of the vesicles will be studied.  Specific polymer chains that combine the ability to prevent protein adsorption with conformational properties that enhance targeting of the carrier to specific cells.  The microscopic understanding of the behavior of polymer modified vesicles that will be achieved should able the development of new types of ag gregates for use as reagents that can be used in separation processes, such as protein separation and solubilization of small hydrophobic molecules in aqueous media.  Theoretical studies will be carried out in close collaboration with three experimental groups that are investigating:  1)  the use of end-functionalized polymer-modified liposomes for targeted drug delivery, 2) vesicle-membrane fusion induced by chemical modification of the vesicle and 3) protein adsorption on polymer-modified surfaces.    The teaching plan is divided into two parts.  One describes the approach to be taken in formal classroom teaching.  The other presents the different projects that go beyond the formal teaching requirements.  In the former, the basic idea is to provide the students with the links between physical processes, mathematical tools and experimental measurements.  Understanding this relationship enables students to quickly grasp new concepts based on previously learned subjects.  The informal activities that will be undertaken include special topic discussions, lectures and research for undergraduate students interested in specific applications  of the general field of physical chemistry.  These activities will be confined to select small groups of students; the aim being to provide the personalized attention that is not generally available in large formal classes.  Furthermore, the teaching plan also includes special topic research projects for undergraduate and graduate students.  ***",
