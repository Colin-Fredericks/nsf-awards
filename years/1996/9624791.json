 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will formulate and develop a method for controlling the   traffic carried on a broadband communication network, specifically for the   case of carrying diverse real traffic sources with difficult to model and   analyze queueing properties; inter-source correlation; slowly varying   statistical properties; diverse heterogeneous source types; mis-specified   traffic descriptors; and inadvertent network traffic shaping. The focus is   the case when the traffic sources are given quality of service guarantees   and the goal is to maximize utilization of network resources. The method is   based on statistical classification techniques that use historical data as   to what were acceptable combinations of carried traffic and what were not.   Problems addressed include efficient representation and storage of   historical data; choice and modification strategy of classifier model;   noise on the data; confidence intervals on decisions; directed and   undirected exploration of the decision space; filtering out uninformative   data; and implementations. The effectiveness and advantages of the methods   developed will be experimentally tested against alternative methods on   simple models and real traffic traces such as ethernet data; variable rate   video; and ISDN traffic.",
