The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Jason A. Cody to work with Professor Jean  Rouxel at the Institut Universitaire de France in Nantes,  France.  Their project is entitled, \"Synthesis,  Characterization, and Theoretical Band Structure  Calculations of the New Misfit-Layer Selenides   USe m NbSe2 n 1.0<m<1.25; n=1,2 .\"        Dr. Cody plans to focus his research on the hydrothermal  synthesis and characterization of new transition-metal  chalcogenides.  There will be a strong interaction with  theoretical band-structure calculations in an effort to  understand the physical properties of the new compounds.  The vast array of naturally occurring chalcogenide minerals  provides a starting point for this research.  The Rouxel  group brings their theoretical and computational expertise  together with Dr. Cody's experience in solid-state  synthesis.  This collaboration will help Dr. Cody add  theoretical calculations to his offerings as a research  advisor.  He plans on conducting research with  undergraduates as a professor of chemistry at Lake Forest  College, a small liberal arts college in Illinois.        ***",
