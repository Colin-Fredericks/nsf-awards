 "awd_abstract_narration": "9523969  Stuber       The proposed research will develop new algorithms for fast  link quality evaluation and new algorithms for distributed link  control in microcellular mobile telephone systems.  Link quality  evaluation and control are essential elements of any cellular  system.  However, future microcellular systems will be  characterized by large numbers mobile customers, and many  (sometimes rapid) cell boundary crossings.  Limitations on the  speed of link monitoring and control essentially determine the  overall link quality, the cell sizes, and the ability of the  cellular system to react to traffic variations.  These factors in  turn determine the spectral efficiency and grade of service.  As a  result, fast link quality evaluation and distributed link control  will be essential for the successful deployment of microcellular  telephone systems.       The approaches to be employed in the study involve a mixture  of theoretical work in propagation modeling, signal processing,  teletraffic modeling, stochastic processes, and control theory, as  well as computation and simulation on workstations.  A software  simulation capability in presently available at Georgia Tech that  uses either recorded strips of actual channel measurements or  various theoretical and empirical models.  ***",
