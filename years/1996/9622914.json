 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9622914  PI:  William Ross  University of Richmond     The principal investigator will conduct research on operators   on spaces of analytic functions. Such problems explore the   relationship between functional analysis and complex function  theory. The first part of the proposal examines the invariant   subspaces of the \"backward shift operator\" on a general Hilbert  space of analytic functions. In the second part of the proposal,  the principal investigator plans to examine the Bergman space  on a \"crescent\" domain and examine certain subspaces which are  invariant under the linear transformation \"multiplication by z\".  In the third part of the proposal, the principal investigator   plans to look at the closure of the polynomials on the   \"standard crescent\" (the region bounded by two internally   tangent circles).       As mentioned earlier, these types of problems combine two   fields of mathematics, functional analysis and complex function   theory. This link was first noticed by Arne Beurling in 1949   in his seminar paper on the shift operator. Further results on the   shift were taken up by several Russians such as Korenblum,   Nikolskii, Havin, Shirokov, and Shamoyan.   In this proposal we examine these same problems but will pay closer  attention to the geometry involved.",
