 "awd_abstract_narration": "9531507  Mathias       This REU site award will provide a new type of  educational opportunity for undergraduates that combines  research experiences over two summers, first at an academic  site and then at an industrial one.  Rising juniors will  first attend USM to receive broad training (first week  short-courses) in polymer science, instrumental analysis,  and safety followed by a research project carried out in  collaboration with industrial partners.  Two separate  weekly meetings of students and faculty will involve: 5  minute student summaries of their projects combined with an  industrial presentation on selected topics; and an  introduction to molecular modeling combined with  discussions on professional ethics.  Final talks will be  given to combined USM-industrial participants.  Rising  seniors will spend their summer continuing the projects at  industrial sites (like a co-op or internship) but with  project groundwork already established.  Weekly  teleconferences will be held with the faculty partner.  Final presentations will  be given at USM in the same summer-end meeting for the  first-summer students.       A total of 15 students are planned for the USM program  each summer, 10 funded by NSF and 5 by industrial grants  (10 X $2500 each).  Second-summer industrial stays will be  totally funded by industry, as will travel to USM for the  final program.  Each of 10 industrial partners will take 1  or 2 second-summer students, depending on attrition.  Student recruitment will build on existing strong programs  at USM, but will extend to include active participation by  industry in finding local and regional participants.  Minorities and women participants will be sought through  USM's extensive network of feeder schools and the  undergraduate recruitment office.  Projects will be jointly  developed by USM professors and industrial scientists, and  will involve basic exploration of real-world problems  (examples are included).  By year four of this project, the  10 industrial partner s will be asked to increase their  support (to $7500 each) to make this a self-sustaining  program for training undergraduates for careers in the  polymer industry and graduate school.  ***",
