Dr. Reddy will work with Dr. Keiichi Tanaka, Director of the  Chemical Synthesis Laboratory at NIMCR on a research project  entitled, \"Environmental Protection: Titaniumdioxide as a  Photocatalyst for Waste Water Treatment.\"    The main objective of the research is to develop a potential  catalyst which is able to concentrate the organic pollutants  from the environment and thereby mineralize them into  harmless chemicals.  Special attention will be paid to the  volatile organic halocarbons that are causing the depletion  of atmospheric ozone layer and are potential dangers to the  global ecosystem.  The research is also designed to explore  advanced techniques to remove aromatic hydrocarbon  pollutants from drinking water.    The proposed research is considerable interest in the United  States and Japan and the facilities at the Chemical  Synthesis Laboratory in Tsukuba will provide an excellent  location for research efforts.  The research will provide a  valuable learning experience for Dr. Reddy, and will likely  yield positive results for the United States and Japan as  well as the international community as a whole.  As such,  the research satisfies the objectives of the program in its  emphasis on the exchange and transfer of scientific  knowledge through international collaboration.  ***",
