 "awd_abstract_narration": "Montana Tech of the University of Montana is the recipient of funds from the National Science Foundation to support the renovation of research and research training space in its Chemistry Building. Constructed in 1921, the structure has supported research activities for the Metallurgy, Chemistry and Geochemistry Departments for 75 years. Mission focused research and training have been a historical strength of the university, and Montana Tech's location in Butte, places it near the largest Superfund site in the United States.   This combination has produced a dramatic increase in funded research in chemical and biological remediation technologies and related scientific issues.  Growth in interdisciplinary research, combined with research in the metallurgy, mining, petroleum, biology, and chemistry programs, has led to an increase of funding as well. However, because of the age of the facility, the poor condition and capacity of the utility infrastructure, and the complete lack of a modern ventilation system, research is hampered by existing conditions. Renovations will include replacing the original 1921 electrical, heating, mechanical, and ventilation systems. Poorly designed space will be reconfigured to comply with ADA regulations and allow for more flexibility and efficient space usage.  New fume hoods will replace the original building hoods, and a centrally located autoclave will be installed. Dispersed chemical storage will be consolidated in a centralized area that will allow for the safe storage and handling of hazardous materials and waste. Both the Chemistry and Biology Departments will share the facility, which will enhance existing collaborative research in biological remediation, and increase the breath and depth of the joint programs.",
