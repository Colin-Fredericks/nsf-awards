 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem addressed by this project is that many students do not have an opportunity to conduct sophisticated ecological research when they are juniors and seniors. The solution to this problem is to develop a program in modern ecology at the upper-division level emphasizing molecular approaches to investigating ecological questions. Students participating in this project are taking a new course in molecular ecology and are conducting substantive independent research in this area. They are using the techniques of molecular biology to answer questions about the role of genetic heterozygosity in metabolic adaptations, the role of heat shock proteins in the seasonal acclimatization of fish, the role of paternity in population biology of frogs, and various other ecological issues.   This program includes a component designed to increase the number of women and minorities in ecology. By working directly with the Philadelphia High School Academies, the principal investigator is recruiting additional women and minorities.   Upon completion of this program undergraduates will be conducting molecular ecology research at an advanced level.",
