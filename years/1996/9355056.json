 "awd_abstract_narration": "The next generation of ecologists and organismal biologists will be called upon to link their  basic-science focus with other skills necessary to solve major environmental and social problems.   These skills--in public policy, environmental law, management, and scientific communication--  are severely lacking in our current graduate training.  We propose a cross-disciplinary training  program that will provide students with a rigorous introduction to the methods of environmental  science and exposure to the tools necessary to apply the fruits of their research to attack major  social and environmental issues.  Before initiating their diqsertation research, students will  complete a two year curriculum consisting of new lecture, seminar and field courses.  Field and  management courses will draw on personnel and resources of the Conservation Research Center  of the Smithsonian Institution.  Seminar courses on scientific communication, current  environmental issues, and environmental law and policy will draw on faculty from other graduate  schools at the University of Pennsylvania and other professionals actively involved with these  issues.  These courses, together with basic science research will provide trainees with exposure  to the methods needed to affect scientific and social solutions to environmental problems.",
