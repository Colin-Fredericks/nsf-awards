 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns a fundamental problem of machine learning,  which  is  how  to learn when the originally given representation  space  is  of low quality.  Most machine learning methods  search  for desirable knowledge in the same representation space in which  training examples are presented (that is, use the same attributes  or  terms  as  those  employed in the  training  data).   If  the  original  representation space is inadequate, that is, the  given  attributes  or descriptive terms are insufficiently  relevant  to  the present learning task, such methods do not perform well. This  project investigates several novel ideas and methods for learning  in  such  situations.   In  particular, we  are  investigating  a  constructive  induction  approach to  the  problem,  in  which  a  learning system performs a double intertwined search - one for an  improved  knowledge  representation  and   one  for  the   \"best\"  hypothesis  in  that  space.  In the multistrategy   constructive  induction  methodology, a combination of strategies  is  employed  for  transforming the initial representation space into  the  new  task-oriented  space.   the  space transformation  operators  are  divided  into  \"constructors\" that expand the space by  inventing  new  attributes  and  \"destructors\"  that  reduce  the  space  by  removing  or abstracting the current attributes, guided by  \"meta  rules\" that are initially provided, but incrementally improved by  a secondary learning process.",
