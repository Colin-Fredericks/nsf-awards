 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514880  Mizumori    To study the process by which sensory-based, organism-  centered  spatial information is transformed into an allocentric  coordinate system, we will  examine the relative sensory and mnemonic contributions  within individual  tectolimbic structures to accurate navigation.  This first  step is essential in order  to define target structures within the neural system of  interest.  The original specific  aims also proposed to test the functional connectivity  between the target brain  structures so that we could begin to evaluate the dynamical  interactions between structures.  However, the latter  specific aim has been eliminated.  To facilitate  comparisons between structures, these experiments will focus  on one well  studied form of navigational learning, visual spatial  learning by rats on a  radial maze.  Comparison of the response properties of  information  representation in a variety of brain structures during a  single behavior  will allow future studies to begin to postulate the sort of  dynamical  interactions that must exist between brain areas if adaptive  consequences  of spatial processing are to be realized.    In order to understand how organisms utilize the tectolimbic  circuit  in a behaviorally meaningful way, it is essential that we  determine how this  system affects the ongoing behavior of the animal.  We  hypothesize that  striatal structures such as the nucleus accumbens and  caudate nucleus serve  to integrate hippocampal spatial information with nonspatial  reward-related  information to direct the initiation of voluntary behavior  via efferents to  the ventral pallidum, a critical structure for the direct  control of  voluntary behaviors. Together, the results of this neural  system analysis  will not only provide new and important insight into how  multiple brain areas  might act in concert during navigation, but our findings  should also afford  new opportunities to learn about neuroplastic mechanisms  that might be  available during normal spatia l learning.    Single unit responses of the same 12 brain structures listed  in the  original proposal will be recorded as rats perform a  nonspatial and spatial  learning task on the radial maze.  The structures selected  comprise the  tectolimbic and limbic striatal systems.  Preliminary data  show that it is  possible to classify these various cell types as spatial or  nonspatial, and  that we can determine the relative mnemonic and sensory  contribution of  these cells to navigation.  A memory function will be  suggested if 1) there  is protracted shaping of the correlate during acquisition of  a spatial  task, 2) if there is evidence for contextual dependency of  the  representation, and/or 3) if there is short term persistence  of the  representation in the absence of environmental (visual)  cues.  Exps. 1-3  will test these possibilities.  Exp. 4 and 5 will evaluate  the  sensory-dependence of the representation by observing cell  responses  immediately after the removal of visual cues, and after  scrambling of the  cues.  Vestibular sensory contributions will be assessed by  rotating the  center portion of the radial maze, then observing unit and  behavioral  responses (Exp. 6).  Intramaze olfactory sensory influences  on the spatial  representations will be tested by observing unit responses  to rotation of  the entire maze (Exp. 7).  Exp. 8 will investigate the role  of voluntary  movement to spatial representations.  Finally, since  accumbens cells are  sensitive to differences in reward magnitude, Exps. 1-8 will  take place  using rewards of different magnitude.",
