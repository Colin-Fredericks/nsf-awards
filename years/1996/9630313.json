 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phylogenetic analysis is a powerful methodology  with  broad  explanatory   power  derived  from  its  ability   to   make  predictions about evolutionary process. However, the process  of arriving at a classification involves decisions about how  to  reconcile multiple tree solutions, how to visualize data  changes  on  phylogenetic tree topologies, how to  represent  conflicts among solutions based on different data  sets  and  finally, methods for presenting these results in publishable  form.    The  field  of scientific visualization specializes  in  the  development  of  visual  display techniques  to  reveal  (1)  patterns  and structure within a data set, and (2)  patterns  and  structure between data sets. The phylogenetic tree,  or  cladogram,  is an example of type (1) visualization  because  it reveals the relationships among taxa within a single data  set.   Type  (2)  visualizations  instead  focus  upon   the  simultaneous presentation of multiple data sets or  multiple  representations of the same data set.    Within  this proposal we outline a series of highly  visual,  data   driven  methods  for  data  inspection,  simultaneous  multiple tree visualization, evaluation of assumptions about  the  analysis  (e.g.,  choice of root  taxon),  presentation  techniques  for hierarchical data and methods  for  linking,  through the World Wide Web (WWW), phylogenetic trees to  the  data  that  generated the result(s). Few or  none  of  these  techniques are in current use in systematics, in fact,  they  represent  very recent research within computer science.  We  -believe  that  the richness and complexity of  phylogenetic  analysis  invites new methods for visualizing the analytical  process.  MacClade   Maddison92 , a  Macintosh  program  for  visualizing  data  change  on a single  tree,  enhanced  our  understanding  of  the  how character  changes  occurred  on  single tree topologies. We will expand that type of analysis  to  include far richer visual metaphors for viewing the da ta  matrix to phylogeny pathway.    The  research we are proposing is exploratory and by  design  we  will investigate methods that may not prove fruitful for  all  data sets. However, the applicability of these  methods  for  other  forms of hierarchical data makes the  likelihood  high  that some or even most of the visualization tools will  assist  researchers in all areas of comparative biology.  In  addressing the visualization problem, the assumptions--a 2D,  static  medium,  Euclidean drawing space, separate  figures,  data  and  explanations and homogeneous levels of detail  in  single illustrations--implicit in current tree visualization  techniques  must  be  re-examined.  We  envision   that   as  electronic journals become ever more prominent in  all-areas  of  science  the  need  will exist  for  display  techniques  optimized  to on-line viewing. This research should  provide  significant    insight    into    means    for    displaying  classifications  and  systematic analyses  within  this  new  medium.    Although  a  large  number of the specific deliverables  for  this  research will be \"backend\" programs for  creating  the  visualizations .and database architectures for storing trees  and  data,  we  will provide access to the entire  suite  of  technologies through WWW browsers (by mid-1996, browsers for  all  major  workstation and PC platforms should  incorporate  the  capability for viewing these results).  Users  will  be  able  to  input  and store trees and NEXUS (a standard  file  format  for  phylogenetic data) data matrices for subsequent  analysis, all within their browser.",
