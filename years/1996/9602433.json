 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Telecommunications and Networking Engineering Technology Education Project    Springfield Technical Community College (STCC) is undertaking an Advanced Technological Education (ATE) in Telecommunications and Networking Engineering Technology Education. The project is a collaborative effort with STCC joined by partners: the University of Connecticut, the University of Hartford (CT), and the City of Springfield (MA) Public Schools. Its purpose is to develop an integrated curriculum, a teacher training model, and a model laboratory which meets the training needs of the telecommunications and networking industries in the 21st century. Development of the project also includes the active involvement of both private industry and other public sector agencies. STCC currently offers highly successful programs in Electronic Systems Engineering Technology, Computer Systems Engineering Technology, Laser Electro-Optics Technology (which also includes photonics and fiber optics) and a variety of other cutting-edge high technology programs. The project is developing a national innovative model featuring traditional test equipment, evolving equipment, a \"virtual instrumentation\" lab and simulation software to present to students both real and simulated field experiences. Further, STCC is developing articulation agreements with secondary schools and baccalaureate institutions, providing instructors and facilities for teacher training workshops, evaluating and assessing the project, and disseminating project results. The Project includes a concerted effort to involve women and minorities as students in this new technology offering.",
