 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of a novel, high-efficiency process for the infiltration/densification of fiber preforms.  This method, designated closed-system chemical vapor infiltration (CSCVI), offers several advantages over conventional CVI.  Raw material is used in a highly efficient manner, and unreacted raw material is easily recycled for future use, thereby minimizing materials costs.  Because the process takes place inside a sealed system, there is no waste stream, and only extremely small amounts of hazardous material are used.  The dramatic reduction in the waste stream translates into greatly reduced costs for waste treatment.  This project will specifically address the manufacture of fiber-reinforced ceramic matrix composites (CMCs).  By operating at high efficiencies and minimizing the waste stream, it is expected that the cost reduction per part will be about 45%, based on material costs alone.  Furthermore, because the waste stream is reduced by orders of magnitude, capital equipment required for waste treatment will be greatly reduced.       Essentially any system currently utilizing conventional CVI can benefit from the application of CSCVI.  A successful demonstration of CSCVI is expected to improve the economics of ceramic matrix composites.  CMCs have benefitted from the success of carbon/silicon carbide (C/SiC) and SiC/SiC materials.  The cost of these materials is quite high, however, and any technique that will significantly reduce their cost is expected to find a large commercial market.",
