Examples  include military and international policy contexts, business  forecasting, medical diagnosis, and earthquake prediction.   Experts do not always agree with each other, nor do they always   express themselves in ways that best reflect their underlying  opinions.  This research will develop new and improved procedures  for eliciting and combining their judgments to yield the most  accurate and diagnostic conclusions.     The project will investigate factors that affect human judgment  under conditions of incomplete knowledge.  The research also will  develop new analytic procedures for such judgments, which take  into account the sources and nature of the random error  components that are normally present.     One line of the project will ask why, if people are generally  truly overconfident, they appear systematically underconfident  given specific procedures and methods of analysis.  A second line  will explore why, at least for some judgment tasks, the way in  which people think about uncertain information depends on the  type of response they are required to give.  A third line will  investigate how people learn to make probability estimates and  how feedback affects those estimates.  The goal of all three  lines of research is to develop a cognitive model of human  information processing under uncertainty that applies to a broad  range of situations, and can be expressed mathematically.     One application of the mathematical model to be developed is to  serve as a basis for combining multiple subjective estimates.  A  fourth line of work will pursue this goal.  This approach is  novel, as no other approach to the issue of combining judgments  has depended on a model of the individual judge.    ***",
