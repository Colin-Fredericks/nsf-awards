 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding is requested for a state-of-the-art high speed  fluorescence activated cell sorter to be utilized by a group of seven  major users on the Iowa State University campus. The technology  utilized in flow cytometry has advanced rapidly in the past five years  to include both high speed processing of multi-parameter signals for  both analysis and sorting, as well as the incorporation of larger flow  cell tip orifices to accommodate the sorting of larger particles (up to  400 micron diameter flow cell tips). The justification for requesting  matching funds for the purchase of a high speed sorter can be viewed in  three sections. First, the existing EPICS 752 instrument within the  facility has been in operation for eight years and has become the  limiting factor in the progression of the projects outlined here as a  result of increased downtime and the slow rate of data processing for  both analysis and sorting. Secondly, many of the research projects have  common requirements that the ELITE ESP cytometer will be able to  provide which will enable these projects to progress forward. They  include the large scale production sorting (> 106 cells) of large cell  or particle subpopulations that represent only a small portion of the  overall distribution (< 5 %). The following cell or particle types are  both large, often fragile, and represent a minor portion of the  population to be sorted. They include: swine inner cell mass cells (35  microns), Arabidopsis protoplasts (35 microns), soybean cyst nematode  eggs (100 microns), and mouse ine trophoblastic giant cells (200-300  microns). The rapid cell sorting capabilites are also required for the  large scale production sorting (> 106 cells) of the traditional smaller  mammalian cell types such as Iymphocytes for the purpose of assaying  cytokine production and hybridoma cells to be analyzed for the loss of  or mutation with the gene encoding the heavy chain for antibody.  Additionally, the expansion to a multiple laser system will facilitate   the move to four color analyses and cell sorting in the case of the  swine Iymphocytes. Finally, the operation of the Facility which will  house this instrument has a well documented and solidly financed  educational component for training faculty, post doctoral research  associates, as well as graduate and undergraduate students in both the  experimental design, sample preparation, and use of the fluorescence  activated cell sorter in research and the Facility will continue to  fulfill this componet with a state-of-the-art instrument. The new ELITE  ESP will be used extensively for all of these purposes in both research  as well as teaching.",
