 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI and his collaborators have been involved in: (a) some of the  subfields of theory that have witnessed impressive recent advances  (approximation algorithms, on-line algorithms), (b) a subfield that  has been very successful and relevant, but is facing new challenges  (database theory), and(c) ``exporting'' complexity-theoretic ideas  to other disciplines (e.g., Game Theory, Economics, and Artificial  Intelligence).   The goals of this project include: (1) The  deepening and broadening of recent advances in approximation  algorithms and on-line algorithms, by attacking fundamental problems  such as the Euclidean traveling salesman problem and the k-server  conjecture; (2) The study of alternative models and metrics, for  example, in relation to on-line algorithms for storage allocation,  that are closer to reality and to computational practice; (3) The  introduction of approximation and on-line problems that in a small  way contribute to our understanding of the computational  requirements of a global information environment; (4) The study of  database-theoretic problems that are posed by novel media and  heterogeneity; (5) The continuation of PI's research program that  considers problems from other disciplines (such as, Game Theory,  Genetics, and Artificial Intelligence) from a complexity-theoretic  point of view.***",
