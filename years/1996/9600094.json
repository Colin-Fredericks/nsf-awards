 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600094  Feeny    This  project  combines the approaches  of  systematics  and  chemical ecology to investigate the factors controlling  the  number of host species attacked by wasps of the genus Trogus  (family  Ichneumonidae),  all species  of  which  parasitize  caterpillars of the butterfly family Papilionidae.    The  systematics  of  Trogus  and  related  genera  will  be  investigated  to  identify trends in the evolution  of  host  associations.   To  identify  mechanisms  of   host-finding,  behavioral  experiments  will be conducted  with  the  North  American species Trogus pennator.  By comparing the chemical  compounds used to locate host caterpillars on different food  plants,   this  research  will  test  the  hypothesis   that  taxonomic   restriction   in   host   range   results   from  conservative  responses to chemical  cues  shared  by  these  plants.    Parasitic wasps are the single most important natural  enemy  of  crop  pests.  Better understanding of their biology  may  suggest new ways to manipulate parasitoids and agroecosytems  for improved pest control and reduced use of insecticides.",
