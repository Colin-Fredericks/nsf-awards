 "awd_abstract_narration": "Capillary electrophoresis is becoming increasingly important as an analytical tool in many areas of chemistry and related fields. Several colleges and universities have begun to introduce capillary electrophoretic methods into their undergraduate programs, but there remains only one published report of the use of capillary electrophoresis for undergraduate education.   The project begins the process of modernizing the instrumental facilities with the purchase of a capillary electrophoresis system with photo diode array detector and workstation for data acquisition and analysis. Through the use of this instrument, students can be exposed to several areas of chemistry and instrumental analysis previously lacking in the department. Laboratory exercises are being developed for an instrumental methods laboratory and a biochemistry laboratory. The capillary electrophoresis system is also made accessible to undergraduates conducting research in chemistry and related disciplines.",
