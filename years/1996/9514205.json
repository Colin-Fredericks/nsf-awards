 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514205  Huey    Conditions   experienced  by  a  developing   insect   often  influence  its  size  and  performance  as  an  adult.   For  example,  food levels and crowding have profound effects  on  size  and  reproduction of adult  insects.  Consequently,  a  consideration  of  the  importance of these   \"developmental  effects\" is crucial to understanding the ecology of  insects  in  nature.   Moreover,  knowledge  of  these  developmental  effects  can be used effectively in designing protocols  for  optimal  mass-rearing  of  insects,  as  is  often  done  in  biocontrol  programs.  This project will explore the  effect  of   developmental   temperature  on   adult   fruit   flies  (Drosophila   melanogaster).   The  temperature  experienced  during  development (larval and pupal stages)  is  known  to  influence many aspects of an adult insect's biology, but the  actual  impact  may  depend  as  well  on  the  temperatures  experienced  as  an  adult.  This  project  uses  a  complex  experimental   design   that    independently    manipulates  temperatures  of both developing and adult flies,  and  then  tests  several  competing hypotheses.  An  adult  insect  is  influenced not only by temperatures experienced  during  its  own   development,  but  sometimes  also   by   temperatures  experienced  by  its parents.  This project  will  similarly  determine  the  significance  of  such  \"cross-generational\"  effects  on  offspring.  The results of  this  project  will  elucidate  a  basic issue in  entomology - namely,  to  what  extent  is  the  performance  of  an  insect  sensitive   to  conditions  experienced by itself at  earlier  developmental  stages  and by its parents.   Moreover, information  derived  from  this  study  will  indicate  whether  quality  control  programs  used in mass-rearing of insects should incorporate  temperature as a dynamic variable for study.",
