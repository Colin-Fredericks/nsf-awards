 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pierce  9626774    This is an award to support conduct of a conference to consider  advances in the knowledge-base supporting environmental  engineering practice that have been made by investigators who  have been supported by the National Science Foundation's \"young  investigator\" programs.  Starting with the Presidential Young  Investigators (PYI) initiative in 1984, NSF has supported a total  of 36 PYI's, NYI's (National Science Foundation Young  Investigators) and PFF's (Presidential Faculty Fellows) for a  total investment including matching funds from industry of almost  $5 million.  The diversity of research that has been conducted by  these investigators reflects the program's objectives to restore  contaminated environmental resources to useful quality and to  reduce adverse effects of solid, liquid and gaseous discharges  into land, water and air that impair their usefulness.    The product of this conference is expected to be used in planning  operation of the Environmental Engineering Research program as it  addresses outstanding issues in environmental engineering  practice.  Results are also expected to assist in advancing the  National Science Foundation's commitment to the core strategy of  integrating research and education as articulated in its  strategic plan.",
