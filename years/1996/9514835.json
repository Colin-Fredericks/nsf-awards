 "awd_abstract_narration": "Zoeller  9514835    The ability of organisms to respond to cold environments and to  nurse their young, in spite of the seemingly disparate nature of  these stimuli, actually depends on the activation of  the same  neurochemical-containing cells in the brain.  The chemical produced  by these brain cells is a small peptide called  thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which controls metabolism by  regulating the secretion of thyroid hormones.  Dr. Zoeller is  assessing the ability of these stimuli to modify the production of  TRH in the brain.  Additionally, while TRH is involved in the  response to these stimuli, it appears that distinct subpopulations  of cells, all producing TRH, are responsible for each response.   Using molecular tools, identification of these subpopulations is  being explored.  The mechanisms involved in organismal responses to  the environment and the energy demands place upon them, is critical  to the survival of all species of animals, as is the ability to  care for their young.   A greater understanding of brain mechanisms  in these areas will foster our ability to facilitate species  survival in captivity and in the wild.",
