 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mobile hosts in a wireless network can move from one location to another  while maintaining continuous network connections. This project aims to  develop routing mechanisms for wireless networks that are scalable and are  compatible with wired networks. It integrates the basic IP mobility support  with hierarchical dynamic routing protocols, allowing efficient routing to  mobile hosts through secure and incremental propagation of location  information. It separates mobile handoff due to the air interface from  routing handoff at the network layer. Such separation provides flexible  tradeoffs between routing traffic and routing efficiency. Both mobile hosts  and mobile support routers are able to control location propagation as  route changes, in order to adapt to different requirements of applications  and network management. By involving the home agent of a mobile host only  in a routing handoff, it leads to a new mobile handoff procedure with a  shorter delay. It offers better support for multicast from mobile hosts by  control over location propagation and facilitates multicast to mobile hosts  by a notion of potential group membership.    The project includes the construction of a wireless network simulator and  the implementation of a wireless network testbed. The simulator allows  detailed performance studies and a deeper understanding of different  alternatives for routing and mobility support in local as well as wide area  wireless networks. The testbed offers an experimental tool for migrating  existing applications to wireless networks and for gaining practical  experiences of network communications on mobile hosts. Tools developed in  this project will be incorporated into appropriate undergraduate and  graduate courses. Transparent, flexible and efficient routing is critical  to seamless network access by mobile hosts as they move between networks in  vastly different environments. Insights gained in this project on routing  support for mobile hosts will also shed light on building m obility-aware  applications at higher levels.",
