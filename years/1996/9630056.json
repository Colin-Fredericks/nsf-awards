 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this study Professor David Micha of the University of Florida is being   supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the   Division of Chemistry.  Theoretical methods are being developed which   treat the time-evolution of electronic excitation, electron transfer and   orbital polarization in ion-atom collisions and in electron transfer   collisions.  The goal of this theory, which is based on time-dependent   molecular orbitals, is to provide new insights, concepts, and methods for   describing collision- induced and photo-induced electronic transitions.    A related objective is the development of methods for computing the time   evolution of electronic state populations, differential and integral   cross sections, and electronic branching ratios.  Applications are being   made to the description of atom-atom, atom-diatom, and atom-solid surface   collisions.    The evolution in time of the properties of atoms and molecules as they   undergo collisions or interactions with light can be described by modern   theoretical and computational methods based on quantum mechanics.  In   this study new procedures for obtaining these descriptions are being   developed and applied to a wide variety of chemically interesting   systems.",
