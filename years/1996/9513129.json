 "awd_abstract_narration": "9513129  Hodgson    This award supports a three year cooperative research  project between Dr. Keith Hodgson of Stanford University and  Dr. Yoshiyuki Amemiya of the National Laboratory for High  Energy Physics in Tsukuba, Japan.  This project represents a  program of cooperative instrument development for time-  resolved solution, small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) using  synchrotron radiation.  The new instrumentation will be  applied to selected collaborative research projects on  protein folding and allosteric transitions.  The principal  aspects of the research plan are 1) to participate in the  joint development of advanced CCD-based detectors for SAXS  studies; 2) to collaborate on the development of techniques  to investigate structural changes in a faster time domain  (down to about 1 ms) than currently utilized, and 3) to  utilize these developments at the Photon Factory in Japan  and then on an ultra high flux beam line at the Stanford  Synchrotron radiation Laboratory (SSRL) for actual  structural studies of biological systems.  The U.S.  investigators will benefit significantly by participating in  the development of advanced x-ray detector systems in Japan  whereas the Japanese collaborators will gain experience with  the new synthetic multilayer monochromator at SSRL.  This  proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its joint  endeavor bringing state of the art methods from two  countries into a joint international collaborative effort.  ***",
