 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project fills a void in an otherwise well-supported Biology program. In particular, it makes it possible to make sophisticated environmental measurements, provides equipment to make detailed measurements of plant responses to environmental variables, and increases computer availability in the undergraduate Biology courses. Until now, the Biology Department has had no dedicated computers for undergraduate instruction. The goal of this project is to improve the quality of the educational experience and techniques learned by undergraduate students in Ecology, Plant Physiology, Physiological Ecology, and Independent Research courses offered in Biology. In order to expose students to environmental measurements, sophisticated biological instrumentation, and to enhance computer literacy, this project provides funds to purchase a Li-Cor LI-1200 environmental data recording system, a Li-Cor LI-6400 Portable Photosynthesis System, and a Dell notebook computer. The environmental sensors and data-logger teach students how to accurately measure variables that influence the establishment, survival, productivity, and reproduction of all organisms. The photosynthesis system allows students to examine carbon dioxide uptake, water loss, and stomatal responses during photosynthesis in both field and indoor laboratory settings. The sensors are connected to the portable computer, so students also learn how to interface equipment to computers and program the computer for data acquisition. The computer is also used to download weather data files and climate change datasets from the Internet. The project can result in a Laboratory Manual for Physiological Ecology. The effectiveness of the exercises developed around the equipment can be determined by student evaluations.",
