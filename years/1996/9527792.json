 "awd_abstract_narration": "9527792  Elkinton    A high percentage of outbreaking species of tree-feeding Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) are spring-feeding; that is, they feed in early spring soon after budburst of their hosts.  Also, most defoliation occurs simultaneously over wide areas, suggesting that regional weather plays a role in outbreaks, possibly through timing of budburst and insect dormancy-breaking.  We will test the hypothesis that variable synchrony of insect emergence with host tree budburst in spring contributes to outbreaks.  The study insect, the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) shares many traits with other spring-feeding pests, and has been successfully used in population-level experiments.  It is one of the most important forest defoliators in North America.  In this study, the timing of gypsy moth egg hatch relative to host budburst will be manipulated in 25m diameter replicated plots.  The objectives of the study are to measure the effect of synchrony with budburst on:  overall population survival, larval dispersal by ballooning, growth, survival and reproduction, and rates of mortality from natural enemies.  Experimental populations hatching at different times will be created, and larvae will be collected at weekly intervals to determine changes in density and rates of parasitism and disease.   Dispersal will be measured using larvae dusted with fluorescent powder (to record ballooning from particular tree species) and by sampling the canopy outside the release plots at the end of the dispersal period.  Direct foliage age effects on growth and survival will be monitored on insects protected from predation, in mesh bags.  This will permit evaluation of the relative importance of these factors and quantification of the impact of variable synchrony with budburst on population survival.  The results will have implications for the dynamics of other spring-feeding forest insects, as well as making an important contribution to understanding gypsy moth dynamics.    If synchrony with budburst is an im portant component of gypsy moth dynamics, it will help us predict whether outbreaks will occur in a given year, and thus what level of control measures may be required.  Existing temperature-dependent models that predict the timing of gypsy moth egg hatch and tree budburst can be used to estimate synchrony and thus the potential for outbreaks.  A greater knowledge of the complex nature of population regulation of insect herbivores may contribute to design of integrated pest management.  It would help to indicate the relative importance of disease, predators, and host plant resistance, for population control.  The work on dispersal will increase understanding of the spread of invading insects.",
