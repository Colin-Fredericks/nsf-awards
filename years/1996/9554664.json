 "awd_abstract_narration": "A three-year project is proposed to train faculty in the  integration of new teaching techniques that utilize interactive  methods, personal computers, and miltimedia.  Faculty will also be  educated as to the student needs resulting from the recent growth  in diversity in the student population.  Thirty participants will  be selected from two and four-year colleges within the New York  metropolitan area.  These institutions include Long Island  University, Kingsborough Community College, St. Francis College,  Pace University, and New York City Technical College among others.   Participants will be required to submit a plan for dissemination as  a condition for acceptance into the project.  The options under  this plan are: present the results of the utilization of the  teaching methods learned at the workshops at one of six  dissemination seminars conducted during the last two years of the  project; present techniques learned from the activities of the  project to faculty at the participants' home institutions; mentor  two faculty members at the participants' home instititutions in the  teaching techniques learned from the project.  The workshops and  dissemination seminars will be subject to formative and summative  evaluation procedures.",
