 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops three groups of mover-stayer models for the analysis of event-history data.  Mover-stayer models employ a pair of regressions:  an `S-regression` for the proportion of stayers, where stayers are a latent population of `people` with zero risk of having the event, and an `M-regression` for the conditional rate of having the event among movers, where movers are a latent population of people with nonzero risk of having the event.  Mover-stayer models provide information that cannot be obtained from the results of conventional hazard rate models.  This research further develops mover-stayer models by:  (1) extending general mover-stayer models to permit the use of time-varying predictors (2) developing mover-stayer models specifically designed for the analysis of diffusion processes (such as diffusion of information, diseases, or innovation) to identify whether a predictor of a higher rate of diffusion implies either more rapid diffusion, or a larger number of people who are affected by the diffusion event, or both; (3) developing mover-stayer models for event-history data with some missing information.  Applications of these new methodological tools to analyses of first marriages and remarriages, drug-use progression, and residential mobility will provide important new substantive insights.",
