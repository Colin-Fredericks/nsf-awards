 "awd_abstract_narration": "This application requests funds for the purchase of a Bio-Rad  confocal system integrated with a Nikon microscope. The seven major  users of this facility are junior and senior faculty in the Department  of Biology at the University of Rochester, and all are funded from  national granting agencies (NSF, NIH, USDA). The current programs of  the users involve carrying out studies on fate specification, cell-cell  interactions and morphogenesis in developing organisms (Drosophila, sea  urchins, Arabidopsis); the role of cytoskeletal elements in cellular  and organismal functions; the mechanisms of nuclear transport; and  regulation of genome packaging. These projects are unified in using  molecular, genetic and/or biochemical techniques to ask how specific  gene products influence cellular and developmental processes. In order  to carry out quantitation, dynamic analysis and co-localization  studies, all of these projects now require a confocal microscope system  which is: 1) reliable and easily used by a number of individuals; 2)  has multiple types of optics; 3) has flexibility in the excitation and  emission wavelengths; and 4) has excellent resolution in the Z and X/Y  axes. Image analysis software that allows further quantification and  manipulation of the confocal data is also requested.    As members of the Department of Biology, all of the users are also  involved in education of undergraduate and graduate students in both  formal and informal settings. In the context of each of the research  projects described, the requested instrumentation will be used by  graduate students and postdoctorals in training. The instrumentation  will also be employed for demonstrations in undergraduate courses and  outreach programs, and for hands-on experiences- in advanced laboratory  courses and independent undergraduate research projects.",
