 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  ECC-9614225  Howes        As a National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center, now entering its seventh year of NSF sponsorship, the Center for Grinding Research and Development at the University of Connecticut continues to focus its efforts in two areas:  1) the Grinding Center is making significant progress in fulfilling its mission of providing appropriate solutions and training for specific industrial applications in the grinding-dependent industries; and 2) the Center is pursuing strategies to strengthen and diversify its industrial sponsorship and funding base.  These activities are critical given the effects of the depressed economy in Connecticut and the substantial cutbacks in defense-related contracts to Connecticut manufacturers.    The Grinding Center increased its income to more than $2.7 million in 1995-1996 and has developed a $4,000 square-foot complex consisting of a machine shop and laboratories for grinding, micro-machining, metrology, and materials  assessment.  The Center is continually updating and expanding its technical capabilities and resources.    This award provides funding for the first year of a five-year continuing award.   Continued support for another five years will help the Center continue to serve its industrial sponsors and contribute to the resurgence of manufacturing firms regionally and nationally.    As part of the Centers efforts to promote international collaboration in engineering research and development, CGRD has helped arrange and is participating in the hosting of the International Manufacturing Engineering Conference (IMEC) to be held at the university on August 7-9, 1996.  The University of  Connecticut had offered to host this conference for the International Foundation for Production Research.  IMEC will have over 200 internationally recognized researchers, engineers, and professionals from the manufacturing field.  The conference is sponsored by NSF, ASME, and CIRP.    Additional funding is provided  in this award to cover expenses associated with the International Manufacturing Engineering Conference.",
