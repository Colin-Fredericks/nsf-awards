 "awd_abstract_narration": "9634110  Anvari  In many therapeutic applications of lasers, it is desirable to  induce photothermal destruction of subsurface targeted structures  without damaging the overlying tissue.  For example, successful  laser treatment of certain skin disorders such as port wine  stains (PWS), and hemangiomas requires selective destruction of  subsurface targeted blood vessels while protecting the normal,  overlying skin structures from thermal injury.  The objective of  the proposed research is development and optimization of cryogen  spray cooling (CSC) to deliver short spurts of a cryogen (on the  order of milliseconds) in conjunction with laser irradiation to  protect superficial skin structures from thermal injury, while  achieving photothermal destruction of subsurface targeted blood  vessels.  Further development of CSC in conjunction with laser  irradiation will provide substantial relevant data to  investigators interested in therapeutic procedures utilizing the  laser or other radiative sources to induce spatially selective  thermal damage in multi-layered composite structures.    The specific objectives of this proposal are: 1) development of  mathematical models to assist in optimization of CSC and laser  irradiation parameters; 2) in-vivo, and in-vivo experimentation  using collagen film and chicken comb models, respectively, to  verify accuracy of the mathematical modeling, and demonstrate  utility of CSC in conjunction with laser irradiation for  spatially selective thermal damage; 4) design and construction of  a compact, and portable prototype instrument to: a) allow  delivery of cryogen and laser light through an optical fiber; and  b) perform diagnostic measurements that determine depth of  targeted blood vessels prior to selection of appropriate CSC and  laser irradiation parameters; and 5) expansion of the Bio- and  Biomedical-Engineering (BBME) concentration at Harvey Mudd  College (HMC) engineering department.    The preceding tasks will be accomplished through a joint effort             with the Beckman Laser Institute  and Medical Clinic (BLIMC) at University of California, Irvine            (UCI).  Scientists at BLIMC will  collaborate on the development of a diagnostic procedure to  determine depth or subsurface chromophores.  Furthermore,  facilities and instrumentation necessary for successful  completion of the proposed research are available at BLIMC.  The  educational objectives will be achieved  by student participation  in algorithm and instrumentation development, in-vitro  experimentation.  The interdisciplinary nature of the project  will allow development of educational materials for BBME courses  at HMC that would include such topics as biomedical optics, heat  transfer, laser-tissue interactions, biomedical instrumentation,  and numerical optimization techniques.  ***",
