 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Solomon of Stanford University will conduct studies on   metal-containing active sites which have unique spectral features   relative to small molecule complexes of the same ion.  The general goal   is to understand these features in terms of the active site geometric and   electronic structural contributions to the reactivity of these sites in   biology.  The proteins of interest are the blue copper and iron-sulfur   centers which occur in biological electron transfer. The unique spectral   features of these systems in their natural state reflect novel electronic   structures which affect the reduction potentials and the kinetics of   electron transfer.  Specifically, the studies are directed at `perturbed`   blue copper sites which occur naturally or in mutated proteins and have   significant spectral and reactivity differences relative to classic blue   copper sites, and at a thorough understanding of the complete orbital   pathway for electron coupling over the blue copper-Cys-His-Type 2 (or   Type 3) unit involved in intramolecular electron transfer in nitrite   reductase and the multicopper oxidases. The iron-sulfur studies will   focus on the contribution of the electronics to the redox properties of   the rubredoxin iron-sulfur center, and extension to 2- and 4-iron sulfur   centers and to heterometal clusters.  The ultimate goal in these studies   is to experimentally determine the changes in electronic structure   associated with coupling to additional metal centers and to understand   the contributions of electron delocalization to the reduction potentials   and electron transfer reactivity.  A diverse array of sophisticated spectroscopic techniques will be used to   learn about the bonding at the active sites of two classes of   metal-containing proteins. These proteins contain either copper-sulfur or   iron-sulfur centers, are found in most organisms, and function in the   physiological electron transport chains.  The approach to be taken will   entail detailed experimental and theoretical study of simple models of   the active sites, as well as experimental study of a series of modified   copper proteins.  The information obtained will lead to an understanding   of how the bonding at the metal sites controls the rates and energetics   of reactions of these proteins.",
