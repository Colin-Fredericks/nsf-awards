 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Whitney Marine Laboratory is a research institute of the  University of Florida.  It was  established in 1974 and dedicated to a traditional role of  marine laboratories; the use of marine  animals as experimental models with which to address  fundamental questions in cellular and  neurobiology.  This particular approach to marine biology  has come to characterize the  Laboratory within Florida, the Southeast region, and  nationally.  In 1989, the Laboratory initiated  a program in molecular biology.  This program proved to be  enormously powerful and popular, so  much so that nine of the twelve resident  research groups at  the Whitney Laboratory now use  molecular cloning as a routine component of their research.  To accommodate this growth, the  Laboratory assigned additional space to molecular biology-  the facilities currently consist of 21/2  functionally separate rooms, occupying a total of 630 ft2 ,  and a separate isotope lab.  However,  on given day, 12 individuals vie for bench space in any  given room, and during peak times,  visitors and students might raise this number to as many as  20.  This heavy demand inevitably  raises problems of scheduling and, most worrisome,  contamination of cultures and PCR by  extraneous DNA and RNA.  Moreover, several essential items  of equipment are already quite old,  and, in many cases (e.g.,) the autoclave, shaking incubator  and ice machine) they are the only item  of their kind in the Laboratory, making the whole program is  vulnerable to stoppage should one item break down.  Finally,  because the existing facilities are spread across four  widely spaced rooms, the use of the facilities is  inefficient.  To correct these problems this project will  support a consolidated molecular  biology facility, organized and equipped so as to as to  maximize its usage and utility to the resident  faculty of the Whitney Laboratory and to visiting scientists  and students.  This consolidated facility would continue to  operate under the skilled s upervision of the Laboratory's  molecular biologist.",
