 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past decade, researchers have developed tools that offer  automated support for applying formal methods to the design and  analysis of concurrent software systems.  In principle, these  tools allow system designers to utilize formal system  verification techniques without requiring them to know all the  details of the underlying mathematical theories.  In practice,  however, the impact of the tools has been limited because of the  relatively small scale of the problems they can handle and  because of their lack of support for more traditional development  methods for software, such as structured design techniques,  simulation, and debugging.    This research project aims at extending the applicability of  existing automated formal techniques for concurrent systems to  problems of real-life scale and complexity.  The focus is on two  broad issues:  (1) increasing the efficiency and scalabity of  existing approaches; and (2) enhancing the usability of existing  techniques by integrating them with more traditional software  development methods.  More specifically, it seeks to develop  advanced state-space management techniques for checking system  specifications against logical properties expressed in the modal  mu-calculus, and techniques for graphically conveying diagnostic  information for systems that fail to meet their logical  specifications.  The impact of the research is being assessed by  analyzing several real-life applications, such as sliding-window  communications protocols and cache coherency protocols for  distributed shared memory.    This research builds on the investigators' prior work on the  Concurrency Factory, an integrated toolset for specification,  simulation, verification, and implementation of concurrent systems.  ***  _",
