DDC s strengths include:      Inclusion of a science and technology curriculum among program    offerings with which students from Harlem schools can strengthen    preparation for college; this curriculum broadens students     grasp of career potentials in SEM fields and students are    required to complete specific courses in mathematics and    science;        Strong parental involvement;         Number and diversity of students served -- currently serves over    1,000 minority students over the age of twelve (12) annually,    approximately 75% of whom come from low income and first    generation college backgrounds;        Success of students mentored -- 97% high school graduation rate    (with an average number of 186 high school seniors); 98% college    enrollment rate compared to the national enrollment rate of 66%;     88% retention rate and 66% college graduation rate versus the    national rate of 58%;        Special opportunities for students -- academic research    experiences, academic support systems; and strategies leading to    successful matriculation and degree completion in science,    mathematics, and engineering fields; and        Demonstrated quality of institutional life fostering viable    learning, contacts, and career development networks -- creation    of an impressive network between parents and students and    administrators, alumni, faculty and students at Columbia    University.",
