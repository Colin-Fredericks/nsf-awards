 "awd_abstract_narration": "Statement of Objectives  The  objective  of  this research is to develop  a  computational  model  for  the morphogenesis which occurs in the development  of  Dictyostelium  discoideum.  The  life  cycle  of  this  microbial  eukaryote  progresses  from  that  of  a  solitary  amoeba  to  a  differentiated  multicellular  organism,  under  the  control  of  interlinked genetic and physico-chemical processes. The work will  focus   on  extending  successful  models  of  early  aggregation  (encompassing chemotaxis and nonlinear cAMP waves) to  the  mound  structure   and   subsequent  tip  elongation;  also,   we   will  incorporate recent data regarding the role of genetic networks in  the  signal  transduction process into a more  sophisticated  and  hence  more predictive cAMP wave model. Experiments will be  used  to   motivate   modeling   choices  and  subsequently   to   test  predictions,  leading  after  several  iterative  cycles   to   a  simulation  capability currently unavailable  for  this  (or  any  other) developmental biology system.    Methods to be Employed  Simulations  will  be  based  on the recently  introduced  hybrid  scheme where the individual amoebae are treated as automata which  interact  with  the  physical world of chemical  signals,  stress  fields, etc., treated as a continuum. This methodology allows the  modeler  great flexibility in representing the manner in which  a  Dictyostelium  cell  obtains  information  from  the  surrounding  world, reacts (via moving, emission of chemicals, modification of  its  internal  state  variables, etc) to  that  data.  Supporting  experiments will be performed by confocal fluorescence microscopy  using  cells  which  express green fluorescent  protein  under  a  variety  of  distinct promoters. This setup allows us to  measure  mound morphology dynamics as well as track individual cells (from  specific  differentiated cell lines if  needed  )  in  the  three  dimensional multicellular body.    Significance  of  the  Propose d Activity to  the  Advancement  of  Knowledge or Education  Computational methods are beginning to play an important role  in  biology.   As  the  experimental  data  begin  to  indicate   the  complexity  of  genetic interactions and how these exert  control  over  the  developmental program, one will increasingly  need  to  rely on computational procedures to get from single cell behavior  to  multicellular morphogenesis. This research  suggests  a  case  study of the? possible role of computation for the development of  Dictyostelium. If successful, it will not only speed the rate  of  progresq  in  understanding Dictyostelium development,  but  will  also  serve  as  a  guide  for longer term  efforts  to  bring  a  predictive  simulational  capability  to  the  entire  field   of  developmental biology.",
