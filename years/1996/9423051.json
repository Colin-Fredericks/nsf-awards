 "awd_abstract_narration": "Singhal   This project provides partial funding to support a workshop on international technology and operations management to be held at the University of Baltimore, which will also serve as the host.  Other collaborating universities sponsoring the workshop are Harvard, Columbia, Stanford, Tulane, Georgetown, and Indiana.  Topics to be covered in the workshop include problems in product design, manufacturing, and decision making in the supply chain.   International technology and operations management is critical to the competitiveness of a nation.  Yet, the development of the field is weak.  The workshop will provide a forum whereby researchers in the field can share information on research and course development to spur additional activities in the area.  Given the global competitiveness of manufacturing today, the involvement of the business and management academic units is crucial for profitable manufacture.  The involvement of these academic units will provide the avenue through which students of business can have a better understanding of the complex decisions required of a manufacturing enterprise in product design, manufacturing, and marketing.",
