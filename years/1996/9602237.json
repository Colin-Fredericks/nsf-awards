 "awd_abstract_narration": "9602237  This award will provides renewed support to a Research  Training Group in Cytoskeleton Biology at the University of  Minnesota.  Support will be phased out gradually during the  tenure of the award as other sources of funding are secured.  The faculty group includes members of the departments of  Cell Biology and Neuroanatomy, Genetics and Cell Biology,  Biochemistry, and Plant Biology.  The funds awarded will  provide stipends for graduate students and postdoctoral  trainees, will support research participation by  undergraduates, and will defray part of the cost of the  trainees' research.  In addition, funds will be used to  purchase specialized research equipment to be used by  trainees and to bring investigators from other research and  academic institutions to the campus for seminars .  The cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells contains a dynamic,  fibrous network of actin filaments, microtubules and  intermediate filaments that participate in virtually every  aspect of cellular form and function.  Because of the  ubiquity of the network and its role in cellular processes  as diverse as gene expression, cell replication, cell  division, and cell movement, studies of the cytoskeleton  provide an excellent focus for multidisciplinary training in  at the forefront of modern biology.",
