 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is integrating the use of technology into mathematics classes to support reform in both in content and pedagog being developed by the Mathematics Department. The three areas in which the reform is being carried out are College Algebra, the Calculus Sequence, and a Mathematics Seminar for Prospective Secondary School Teachers.  Improvements to be made in the three classes include: (1) integration of calculator and computer activities into the classes; (2) addition of laboratory activities to encourage active student participation; (3) an emphasis on realistic applications; (4) addition of group projects; and (5) certain curriculum revisions.  These improvements are being phased in over a two year period.    The project begins by integrating calculator activities into a College Algebra and a Calculus I class.  Over a period of two years, they are incorporating calculator and computer activities, group projects and applications in all College Algebra and Calculus classes and the Mathematics Seminar for Prospective Secondary School teachers. The significance of this project lies in its potential to improve the mathematical preparation of a significant number of minority students and increase their chances of succeeding in mathematics related fields with a particular focus on prospective teachers.",
