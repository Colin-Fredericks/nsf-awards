 "awd_abstract_narration": "The plant Ceratopteris has a number of unique features that have made it a useful system for experimental research applications. As an offshoot of the development of this model system, we have recognized its potential usefulness for educational purposes in inquiry-based student teaching and research settings. Ceratopteris has a rapid and easily manipulated life cycle as well as other features specifically associated with homosporous ferns that make it unique and complementary to other widely used flowering plant systems. The ability to culture and manipulate large numbers of plants in small dishes, to visualize fertilization of eggs by motile sperm, combined with the simple genetics and availability of a wide range of interesting mutant lines make it an attractive, inexpensive and compelling organism to use for undergraduate education. Initial efforts to develop and disseminate teaching and plant materials have met with demonstrable success and we propose large scale development and promotion of this system at the undergraduate level. We will design laboratory modules that incorporate student inquiry-based and independent research approaches to teaching several basic aspects of biology. Specific strains will be developed incorporating single and multiple mutant alleles to enhance the number of available genotypes. To accompany the written materials we will produce video recordings of specific aspects of the life cycle and of various manipulation techniques. All of these materials, in addition to planned commercial distribution, will be disseminated by means of publications and presentations at national and regional scientific and educational meetings.",
