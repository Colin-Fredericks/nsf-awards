 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the Paul Catlin Memorial Workshop on   Graph Minors and Eulerian Subgraphs, which will be held in Kalamazoo,  Michigan on June 1-2, 1996. The workshop is structured around a series  of instructional lectures, first on graph minors and then on Eulerian   subgraphs. The purpose of the workshop is to bring together workers in  these mainstream areas and help them to merge their methods and ideas.  The proposed timing and location of the workshop are the two days   preceding the Eighth Quadrennial International Conference on Graph Theory,  Combinatorics, Algorithms, and Applications being held at Western Michigan  University.     This research is in the general area of Combinatorics.  Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how  discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of  discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications.  For example, the design of large networks, such as those  occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in  computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this  makes use of combinatorial research. In addition, the type of  enumerative information being sought in this project has been of  use in the design of geometric algorithms for problems in  robotics and motion planning.",
