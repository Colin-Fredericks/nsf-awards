 "awd_abstract_narration": "The carers of nonacademic scientists and engineers remain poorly  understood, especially why few women have technical careers in  industry.  Guided by multidisciplinary theories about careers, this  project compares technical careers to other white collar careers  and examines how gender influences careers.    The research design is a case study of General Motors' engineers  and scientists, including those in its high-tech electronics  division.  A longitudinal database is used to examine job  sequences, including promotions, quits and lateral moves.    The research contributes to public policy debate about a  recommendation that graduate programs produce more versatile  scientists and engineers.  A 1994-5 survey of all GM employees is  used to examine the link between graduate education and diverse job  experiences.    Interactive activities include teaching two innovative course on  applying demography to business and government issues, speaking in  a campus-wide series about Women Leading Technology, and mentoring  and counseling students, especially about nonacademic careers.",
