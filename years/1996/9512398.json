 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Water Resources Research Institute (WRRI) of Kent State University  (KSU) seeks to establish a computer facility for the analysis and  distribution of graphical data for research in water resources. The  facility will consist of a central file and compute server, a network  of graphical workstations for processing and displaying  three-dimensional data and PowerPC workstations for processing and  displaying two-dimensional data, and the necessary input-output support  for high quality image acquisition (scanners, digital cameras, video  cameras) and output (color and black-andwhite printers, slide maker).    Environmental research requires a collaborative, interdisciplinary  approach because of the complexity of natural systems. Field  observations must be integrated with laboratory experiments. Knowledge  from one discipline must be applied to interpret data in another. The  sheer size of some systems (spatial and temporal) requires data sets  too large for a single group of investigators to acquire or to  evaluate. The proposed facility is specifically intended to enhance  collaborative research related to water in the environment, including  on-campus, in-state and out-of-state collaborations. The network will  simplify transfer of graphical data among WRRI members and between KSU  and off-campus workers. The file/compute server will provide on-campus  access to large environmental and climate-modeling databases and will  facilitate the numerically intensive calculations required for modeling  complex systems. Graphical workstations will enable 3D visualization of  climatological, hydrological and chemical structures in real time. The  facility will be administered by WRRI, an interdisciplinary  organization created to foster interdepartmental, collaborative  research on water resource problems.    Current research in WRRI which would be supported by this facility  includes projects on water quality, climate and global change,  ecosystem health, and the application of molecular level  tools to  macroscopic environmental problems. All the PI's are engaged in water  quality research, with specific interests in developing biological and  chemical methodologies (Leff, Cabaniss), system level studies of  chemical and biological perturbations of ecosystems (Heath, Leff,  Smith), modeling of catchment-basin flow and pollutant transport  (Carlson, Maurice), and mapping of water quality on a regional or  national scale (Carlson, Lee). Drs. Maurice and Smith (Geology) are  also examining the role of water in climate and global change. Drs.  Carlson, Heath, Leff (Biological Sciences) and Lee (Geography) are  examining ecosystem health on microscopic and macroscopic levels. Drs.  Cabaniss (Chemistry), Heath (Biological Sciences) and Maurice are  exploring the application of molecular-level tools- molecular  spectroscopy, biochemical assays, atomic force microscopy- to  environmental problems.",
