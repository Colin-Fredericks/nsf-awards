 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seawater 87Sr/86Sr variations during the Early Paleozoic are poorly  documented relative to the resolution of the Late Paleozoic through  Cenozoic portions of the Phanerozoic seawater Sr isotope curve.   The Cambrian portion of the Phanerozoic seawater Sr isotope curve  is especially characterized by a significant degree of scatter and  a large uncertainty envelope.  Moreover, the newly emerging data  base of secular seawater 87Sr/86Sr variations for pre-Middle Cambrian  time underscores a conspicuous gap in the Middle to Late Cambrian  seawater Sr isotope record.  Consequently, the potential of Sr  isotopes for enhanced chronostratigraphic resolution of Middle to  Upper Cambrian stratigraphic successions, is extremely limited for  providing insight into the Middle to Late Cambrian ocean-  atmosphere-biosphere system, and for potentially constraining rates  of biogeochemical cycling during this time interval.    The two main objectives of this study focus on critically  addressing these limitations; the results of this research should  minimize or potentially overcome these limitations.  The first  objective is to complete a detailed Sr isotopic analysis of a  second section of Bonanza King carbonates from the southern Great  Basin in order to test the robustness of the newly resolved Sr  isotope stratigraphy.  The second objective is extend the  integrated study to lower Middle Cambrian carbonates of the Papoose  Lake Member of the Bonanza King Formation and the upper Carrara  Formation, southern Great Basin.  The results of this research,  when integrated with our new resolved Sr isotope curve and recently  published Early Cambrian seawater 87Sr/86Sr values, will provide a  Cambrian seawater Sr isotope curve of resolution comparable to many  portions of the Late Paleozoic and Mesozoic Sr isotope curve.  In  turn, this will afford enhanced chronostratigraphic resolution of  Cambrian stratigraphic successions, a refined understanding of the  Cambrian ocean-atmosphere-biosphere system, and potent ial for  constraining rates of biogeochemical cycling during this time  interval.  Lastly, the 87Sr/86Sr database which will ultimately  result from this integrated study will inevitably contribute  insight into and potentially resolve many controversial 'Cambrian'  issues.    Interactive activities consist of four facets: 1) teaching one  graduate-upper division undergraduate level seminar in cycle  stratigraphy, 2) actively participating in other carbonate  sedimentology, stratigraphy and digenesis seminars, 3) actively  involving undergraduate and graduate students in this research  project, and 4) leading department field trips to the Cretaceous of  Texas and northeastern Mexico.",
