 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested to convene workshops and seminars to  plan and develop ilstructional materials that will use the  Internet and Worldwide Web to interlink the cufficula of  geography departments throughout the United States.  The  goal of the project is to build high quality curriculum  materials including \"electronic\" textbooks and interactive  modules that: 1) span the entire undergraduate curriculum,  2) exploit further the potential of existing Internet  resources, and 3) take full advantage of the hypermedia  format of the Worldwide Web.  The project will allow  geographers at many universities to work toward common goals  and share the time and expense of developing the sorts of  hypermedia curriculum materials that are likely to become  the hallmark of higher education in the twenty-first  century.  The project addresses three important challenges  facing contemporary higher education: 1) to provide faculty  with the skills needed to create hypermedia instructional  materials and use the Worldwide Web effectively, 2) to set  goals for the development of the discipline-specific  educational resources that will support the emergence of  \"virtual\" departments and even \"virtual\" universities, and  3) to help transform the Worldwide Web from an adhoc and  improvised collection of materials into an orderly and  systematically developed resource for education and  research.  To reach these goals, two week workshops will be  held at the University of Texas during the summers of 1996,  1997, and 1998 to bring together thirty faculty from  universities across the nation.  Participants will set goals  for the development of new materials, gain skills in  hypermedia authoring, and write the first modules.  One day  seminars will also be held at the national meetings of the  National Council for Geographic Education and the  Association of American Geographers to: 1) evaluate and  refine materials, 2) present the new materials to a larger  professional audience, and 3) offer hands-on training.",
