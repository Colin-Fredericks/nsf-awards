 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612172  Tour  New routes are described for the facile construction of  organic oligomers of precise molecular weight, constitution,  and in some cases, even stereochemistry, using unnatural and  natural (DNA) templates (parents) of specific length,  constitution, and conformation.  Taking advantage of  precisely-defined synthetic templates that are rigid-rod-  like, the rapid construction of oligomers of nearly the same  length as the templates will be attempted.  Unnatural  monomers will be ionically- or hydrogen-bonded to the  templates via non-covalent bonding moieties (NCBMs), then  oligomerization will be induced chemically or  photochemically to afford a supramolecular parent-daughter  duplex.  The polymerizations should be kinetically favored  since the templated reaction is pseudo-solid state or pseudo-  topochemical in its monomer-monomer orientations.  Cleavage  of the ionically- or H-bound parent-daughter duplex would  afford a new synthetic daughter oligomer that retains the  specific length information of the parent template, as well  as, possibly, the stereochemical information such as the  helical sense.  Methods can be envisioned to re-use the  parent template and the daughter(s) as new templates, thus  making the entire process catalytic in template, and  ultimately natural-like or polymerase chain reaction-like  (PCR-like) in its productive capabilities.  %%%  These precise macromolecular systems are becoming important  for electronics, photonics, molecular electronics,  catalysis, separation science, nano-engineering, and nano-  bioengineering.  This project, if successful, could  significantly simplify the preparation of precisely defined  macromolecular architectures which are currently prepared  only by laborious step-wise procedures or multiple  analytical separations.  ***",
