 "awd_abstract_narration": "A critical issue for large-scale systems design and  evolution is the choice of an architectural style that  permits the integration of separately-developed components  into larger systems. Familiar styles include those based on  remote procedure call, shared variables, asynchronous  message passing, etc.  One increasingly important  architectural style for system composition is implicit  invocation (II).  However, there is no established basis for  reasoning about II systems. In particular it is difficult to  answer questions like: What will be the effect of announcing  a given event? Have enough event bindings been declared?  Does a given component announce the sufficient events to  permit effective integration? If I add a new component to an  existing system, will it break the existing system?  The  goal of this project is to provide such a basis for  reasoning about systems designed using the II architectural  style.  Two central benefits are expected.  The first  benefit is a step towards being able to reason fully about  systems constructed in this style. The second and probably  more important benefit is to replace current ad hoc  reasoning approaches used by practitioners who use the II  style with a collection of sound ideas that allow better  informal reasoning about such systems.  ***",
