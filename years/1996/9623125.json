 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rader     This award provides funding for a project in the Langlands program. The  Relative Trace Formula (as initiated by Jacquet) is a new tool for   studying automorphic L-functions and functoriality in the Langland's  program. Rader and S. Rallis have been collaborating to prove some  of the local results they think necessary to make the Relative  Trace Formula a theorem instead of just a collection of examples. They  have shown that many of the results known for usual character and   central orbital integrals generalize to the case of spherical characters  and double coset integrals on certain p-adic symmetric spaces. They  plan to expand their research to include spherical subgroups such in  the sense of M. Brion. Although it will take many years to complete  such a project, it seems to be the natural domain for relative trace  formulae, because (probably) one dimensional representations of H occur  in irreducible smooth infinite dimensional representations of G with  finite multiplicity. Rader also plans to complete a collaborative effort  with Marie-France Vigneras investigating the geometric Zelevinskii   involution for nilpotent orbits in certain Lie algebras. This should have  applications in constructing modular representations of Hecke algebras,  after Kazhdan-Lusztig.    The Langlands program is part of number theory. Number theory is the  study of the  properties of the whole numbers and is the oldest branch of  mathematics. From the beginning problems in number theory have  furnished  a driving force in creating new mathematics in other  diverse parts of the  discipline. The Langland's program is a  general philosophy that connects  number theory with calculus;  it  embodies the modern approach to the  study of whole numbers.   Modern number theory is very technical and deep,  but it has had  astonishing applications in areas like theoretical   computer science and coding theory.",
