The workshop will be held in Los Angeles,  California on January 15-17, 1997, accelerating the  traditional four year time frame between workshops to take  advantage of lessons emerging in the aftermath of the  Northridge and Kobe earthquakes.  It will capitalize on  increasing research collaboration between the U.S and Japan  and strengthen ties between members of the professional  communities and policy makers from the two countries.  It is  expected that papers and working group records, issued as  proceedings, will have substantial utility for those  interested in post disaster recovery and reconstruction in  the U.S. and Japan.***",
