 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, interactive video resources are being developed to enhance a package of multimedia resources for learning statistics.  Key  components of this package, developed under our previous NSF funding, are already in place: An Electronic  Encyclopedia of Statistical Examples and Exercises (EESEE) and an on-line Data Archive and Story Library  (DASL). Students today are used to  learning about the world from television. News broadcasts routinely provide information that is statistical in nature.  Graduates of an introductory statistics course should be able to assess the quality of such information. Unfortunately,  students are not used to thinking critically about what they learn from television news or special broadcasts. Worse  yet, there are essentially no current systematically-assembled resources available to help students learn to recognize  and critique statistical issues in material that they see or hear. The purpose of this project is to introduce  current video clips from news shows  or special broadcasts on television to create a unique set of resources for learning statistics.   Closed  captioning of the video quotes will  support hearing-impaired students, those for whom English is a second language,  and others who may prefer to read the narrative script.  The methods and organization developed  for EESEE and DASL will allow quick development and implementation of methods and standards for sifting through  current events video in search of suitable stories and data, and for integrating the results into EESEE and DASL.",
