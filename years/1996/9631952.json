 "awd_abstract_narration": "In business, government, and all aspects of life where planning is important, there  is  a need for database management systems that can handle `decision-support queries.`  These complex queries involve the aggregation of very large amounts of data.  Often, special `data warehouses,` or copies of information from a variety  of sources, are created for the purpose of asking decision-support queries, while the original databases are used for  transaction  processing.  Some new  database products implement `data cubes,` special organizations of data that facilitate common  forms  of  decision-support queries.  One important new research problem is data-cube design, where it is feasible to  materialize  a selected set of views to optimize average query time, for a given amount of storage.  Selection of materialized views for data cubes is a major research challenge.  More generally, when views in a warehouse are maintained as the underlying databases change, it  is desirable to have at the warehouse a selection of views so that they can all be updated without having to issue queries at the underlying  databases (so-called `self-maintainability` of views).  Self-maintainable warehouses  present  another  research challenge.  Finally,  decision-support  queries themselves can often be optimized by techniques recently discovered and, it  appears, some new techniques that need investigation.",
