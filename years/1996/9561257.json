 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project will develop a low cost process for producing low carbon content, submicron scale HTSC powders. The work is based on proposed modifications to a patented PSIT process for producing nanophase ceramic powders, a process which allows chemical flexibility, chemical purity, and high yield. In Phase I, efforts will be exerted to the production of bismuth-based BiSrCaCuO family of superconductors (BSCCO).  The discovery of high temperature superconductors (HTSC) produced from mixed metal oxides has opened new possibilities for improving the efficiency of power generation and transmission and developing energy-efficient transportation devices as well as sensitive and accurate instrumentation. Extensive commercial application of HTSC components, however, depends on maintaining acceptable production costs along with the appropriate physical properties.  In the proposed Phase I effort, a mixture of appropriate HTSC precursor inorganic compounds with organic carrier liquid will be sprayed into a combustion system that includes a gas flame and an externally heated furnace. Oxidation of the organic carrier liquid in the mixture droplets will allow the decomposition of the chemical precursors, followed by vaporization and/or diffusion into the gas phase. Subsequent condensation of submicron particulate will lead to the formation of HTSC powders. Because of the expected submicron size of the HTSC powder, fabrication into thin HTSC wire using the powder in tube technique is expected to be straightforward.  The development of a low cost process for the production of low carbon content, submicron high temperature superconducting powders has potentially broad applications: superconducting wires for power transmission, motors, generators, magnets for commercial and industrial use such as medical diagnostic and radiofrequency devices. Other applications include high speed magnetic levitation trains and advanced ship drive systems, infrared sensors, etc.",
