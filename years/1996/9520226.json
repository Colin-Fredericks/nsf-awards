 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to investigate high level  models for the performance and  performability analysis of  distributed computing systems hosting replicated programs  and data  files. The high level models studied rely on  Stochastic Petri Nets (SPN) used hierarchically to  model the behavior of the system in the presence of several types of  hardware faults as well as  software failures. Systems targeted include real-time systems where critical  jobs are deadline  constrained. These jobs are partitioned  into tasks with precedence relations depicted via a task  graph. Although task graphs can be evaluated directly, the  evaluation assumes the existence of an  unlimited number of processing units. Using Stochastic Petri Nets (SPN) the  evaluation of task  graphs can include other constraints such  as a limited number of processors and existing  allocation schemes static or dynamic. At the SPN level, state  reduction can be achieved by  generating only those states  that satisfy functional as well as performance requirements  specified in the form of symbolic boolean expressions. A synergistic approach will be investigated  to predict the  effect of hardware failures on the performance of a system  running a single or  multiple tasks, that may require access  to distributed data files.  The combination of SPN models  and previously proposed reliability models such as those  used to evaluate multiterminal  reliability, has the objective of reducing the state space of the underlying  Markov model  (failure/repair models) even though hardware  failures include nodes and links. Once the  failure/repair  model is generated, performance reward levels can be associated with each  structural state of the system. This work will contribute to the systematic design of  distributed  systems. Design requirements such as delay, network throughput, load, task completion time, cost,  etc.,  will be analyzed in terms of their susceptibility to  failures in the hardware support for  a particular  applica tion. It will also contribute to the evaluation of  existing systems in order  to detect bottlenecks or weak  points and suggest appropriate remedial  course of action (to  either update or replace existing equipment). The  systematic prediction of  performance and  reliability in  terms of selective critical tasks, will aid in the process  of  updating currently  saturated computer systems. In  particular, the performance models of partitioned  jobs will  be  useful in predicting the average completion times under  userselected allocation schemes  via a  single SPN-based model  of a given task graph.  Thus, giving users a rapid  assessment on the  suitability of particular schemes in a  real-time distributed computing environment.  ***",
