Archetypal analysis is a new statistical  method for extracting relevant features from experimental data sets that  has been developed by Cutler and Breiman (Technometrics 1995).  Archetypes characterize extreme data values (those lying on the convex  hull of the data set), and can be thought of as a variation of principal  component analysis, which is also called the proper orthogonal or  Karhunen-Loeve (KL) decomposition by the dynamical systems community.  One of the goals of this project is to compare and  contrast the two  methods, the KL decomposition and Archetypes, in their application to  several experimental dynamical systems, both physical and numerical.  Data sets possessing traveling structures present a special problem to  those hoping to reduce them using the KL decomposition. If the traveling  structure is sufficiently regular the eigenfunctions will be sines  and cosines, since the decomposition produces a Fourier basis from data  that are translationally invariant. Therefore, in situations where the  traveling structure itself is the feature to be extracted, a straight  application the KL decomposition will not suffice.  The proposers are  developing a method that builds on Archetypal analysis to analyze data  with translating coherent structures, by finding, in an objective manner,  archetypes that move with the traveling structure.  The shape of the  structure itself is extracted (or possibly shapes, if the structure  itself is varying as well as translating) along with information on how  the structure is moving across the spatial domain.  Finally, along with  the pattern recognition  problems mentioned above, the third goal of the  proposed research is determining the feasibility of using archetypes as  a basis upon which to do a Galerkin projection of the governing  equations of the dynamical system (when they exist), for modeling  purposes.  %%%  Understan ding, predicting and modeling complex dynamical systems is one  of the preoccupations of the dynamical systems community today.  The  family of techniques dubbed \"dynamical systems theory\" utilized in  this effort is expanding rapidly and in many directions, incorporating  ideas from such diverse fields as mathematics, physics, and engineering.  With the advent of high-speed, large capacity computers, more complex  methods from statistics have become practical in the analysis of data  from dynamical systems.  One such method is archetypal analysis, a new  statistical technique which models the state of the system at a given  time as a mixture of extreme states. The proposers study the application  of archetypal analysis to dynamical systems.  They are comparing  archetypal analysis with other statistical procedures for dynamical  systems, and are developing a new variant of archetypal analysis to  handle moving waves.  The research is interdisciplinary in nature,  involving ideas from statistics, mathematics, and physics.    ***",
