 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wheeler, J. Craig  95-28110    Dr. Wheeler will use a combination of photometry and  spectroscopy, including polarimetry, to better understand the  progenitor evolution, the explosion mechanism and the use of  supernovae as cosmological probes.  A particular topic of  exploration will be Type Ic supernovae which seem to be devoid of  most of their hydrogen and helium envelopes, a critical clue to  their progenitor evolution.  Some of these events have rather  shallow light curves resembling other  events like SN 1993J with rather different spectral evolution and  some have steeper light curves.  This may give clues to the  nature of the collapse, clumping, mixing, and explosion of these  events.  Also to be continued is the program of supernova  polarimetry, which promises critical information concerning the  nature of the ejecta and of the circumstellar environment.  Preliminary results are that Type Ia supernovae are unpolarized,  implying a nearly spherical ejecta and very little circumstellar  scattering, but that Type II, and perhaps all collapse  events, have finite polarization, implying substantial  asymmetries in the ejecta or circumstellar matter.  Finally, the  observational program includes three supernova search programs,  one a visual search for nearby bright supernovae with the newly  dedicated Supernova Search Telescope, one at redshifts of Z about  0.1 to determine possible galaxy evolution effects, and one deep  survey at Z about 1 to constrain cosmological models.    The observing program will be complemented with coordinated  theoretical investigations.  These will include multi-dimensional  models of thermonuclear explosions, including deflagration flames  and detonation structure and stability and gravitational collapse  with multi-dimensional and multi-energy group neutrino transport.  Also computed will be the spectral evolution of models to compare  with observations.  Of special interest is the spectral evolution  of models  that reproduce the dispersion of light curve  speed, color and  maximum brightness associated with Type Ia supernovae.  ***",
