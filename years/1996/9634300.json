The fundamental problem is the   unpredictability of the evolution of technology over the time spans of relevance. Currently   available decision-analysis tools are predicated on the ability to craft some credible best-  estimate prediction of the future. However, policy problems such as climate change face   extreme uncertainties for which it is not possible to construct well-characterized best   estimates. In such cases, prediction-based policy analysis is often unable to resolve   acrimonious debate among stakeholders who believe in different best estimates, and often   results in constrained thinking about possible policy options. In their recent work the   investigators have demonstrated an alternative framework for policy analysis that does not   depend on making best-estimate predictions of the future. The approach is based on two   concepts called adaptive strategies and exploratory modeling. Exploratory modeling treats   problems having massive uncertainty by conducting a large number of computer simulation-  experiments on many plausible formulations of the problem, rather than using computer   resources to increase the resolution of a single best-estimate model. Adaptive-decision   strategies focus on modeling environmental policies where decision-makers can make   midcourse corrections based on observations of the relevant environmental and economic   systems. In this research project the investigators will use the exploratory modeling/adaptive   strategies framework to examine how the potential of new technology should affect near-  term climate change policy choices. The research has two specific goals: 1) demonstrate and   advance the capabilities of the exploratory modeling/ adaptive strategies framework, and 2)   examine a central climate-change po licy question -- under what conditions should society   pursue technology-specific policies (e.g., tax credits, subsidies, or government   procurements) in addition to carbon taxes?    Policy-makers must often make decisions whose ultimate success depends on factors that   cannot be predicted at the time the decision is made. However, currently available decision-  analysis tools used to help policy-makers compare alternative policies are predicated on the   ability to craft some credible best-estimate prediction of the future.  Under conditions of   extreme uncertainty, prediction-based policy analysis is often unable to resolve acrimonious   debate among stakeholders who believe in different best estimates, and often results in   constrained thinking about possible policy options. Climate change provides an important   example. Future technology developments could have profound impacts on climate-change   policy, but no one can accurately predict the impacts of technology on the future costs of   reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, nor the effects that various policies will have on these   costs. In recent work, the investigators have demonstrated a new framework for policy   analysis that does not depend on making best-estimate predictions of the future. The   approach is based on two concepts, called adaptive strategies and exploratory modeling,   that take advantage of the new analytic capabilities provided by recent computer   technology. Exploratory modeling treats problems having extreme uncertainty by   conducting computer simulation-experiments on a very large number of plausible estimates   of the future and using sampling strategies and data visualization to find important patterns   in the results. Adaptive-decision focus on modeling environmental policies where decision-  makers can make midcourse corrections based on observations of the relevant   environmental and economic systems. In this research project, the investigators will use the   exploratory modeling/adaptive strategies  framework to examine how the potential of new   technology should affect near-term climate change policy choices. In particular, the project   will: 1) demonstrate and advance the capabilities of the exploratory modeling/adaptive   strategies framework, and 2) examine a central climate-change policy question -- under   what conditions should society pursue technology-specific policies (e.g., tax credits,   subsidies, or government procurements) in addition to carbon taxes?",
