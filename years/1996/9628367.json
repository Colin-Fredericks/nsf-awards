 "awd_abstract_narration": "Suttner  9628367   The goal of the proposed work is to quantitatively reconstruct paleochannel geometries and hydraulics, and associated alluvial architecture for early Cretaceous fluvial deposits in the Central Cordilleran Foreland Basin (CCFB).  Previous work has shown that the location and flow patterns of the major early Cretaceous rivers in the medial and distal parts of the CCFB were controlled, in part, locally by syndepositional intra-basinal faulting.  This study will elucidate precisely how this faulting influenced channel geometries (e.g. widths, depths, sinuosities, channel patterns), hydraulics (e.g. channel slopes, velocities, discharges), and the distribution of associated channel-bar, channel-belt, and floodplain deposits.  These parameters will be compared and contrasted in (i) medial and distal setting within the CCFB, (ii) in places where the rivers were located essentially on or adjacent to known structures versus places where the structures were several kilometers away, and (iii) where the rivers locally crossed the structures versus where they paralleled them.  Results of this study should be valuable for those who attempt to model how intra-basinal tectonism is manifested n the accumulation of nonmarine fill in the medial and distal parts of foreland basins.  Moreover, this work will be the first of its kind to document quantitatively the effects of localized syndepositional faulting on pre-Quaternary fluvial sedimentation.",
