 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building on the Crossroads in Mathematics Standards: A Project to Develop Introductory Mathematics Curriculum Materials    Most students entering postsecondary education lack the mathematical skills needed to succeed in advanced technology education, engineering, and mathematics- and science-related programs. Curriculum materials are needed for introductory college mathematics to engage students and prepare them for the workplace or further education.    In this development project the Center for Occupational Research and Development (CORD) and the American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges (AMATYC) have formed a partnership with faculty from two-year colleges and professional societies who are experts in contextual learning, learning technology, and professional development. The goals of this project are to identify a core set of mathematical topics and themes that are essential for students preparing for careers in the advanced technological workforce and to select one such theme or topic and develop a rich collection of learning materials around that theme that are based on real-world applications together with supporting pedagogical materials. This modular set of material reflects the AMATYC content standards for introductory level mathematics which include topics in college algebra, trigonometry, introductory statistics, finite mathematics, precalculus, and foundation topics often characterized as developmental mathematics. Furthermore, the materials are being designed to serve the varying needs of all students who need a foundational knowledge of mathematics for engineering, advanced technology, and other technical and non-technical related careers.",
