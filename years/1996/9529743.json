 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9529743  Patton       This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a prototype automated microsatellite genotyping system for commercial applications.  In Phase I of this project, nine microsatellite loci were isolated from hyacinth macaws.  These loci were used for DNA fingerprinting of individual hyacinth macaws and pedigrees.  These loci were also found to work in six other macaw species.  In Phase II of this project, the system will be expanded to include six species from the other major groups of psittacine birds: cockatoos, Old World Parrots, and New World Parrots.  Using new molecular cloning methods, developed in Phase I, 6-10 microsatellite loci in each of the six new species will isolated and characterized.  Protocols will be developed for multiplex PCR(TM) reactions and analysis of multiple loci in a single lane of an electrophoretic gel on an automated DNA sequencer.    Genotype data will be linked directly from the laboratory system to a computerized database.  It is anticipated that at the end of Phase II, a complete, efficient, and cost-effective system will be available for producing a multilocus genotype suitable for individual identity and pedigree analysis for most species of psittacines.       There is a large existing market for genotyping services in parrots and many other species including livestock, pets, laboratory animals, and wild populations.  This market is expected to grow substantially for parrots as the Wild Bird Conservation Act is enforced and positive identity of legally-owned birds is required.  As modern, cost-effective systems, such as that to be developed in this research, become available it is anticipated that the market for genotyping other species will grow rapidly.  ***",
