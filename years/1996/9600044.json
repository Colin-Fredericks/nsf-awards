Dr. Lo is to spend three months at Tokyo  Institute of Technology, with the project funding, to  perform collaborated research in reliable design of logic  circuits and VLSI systems.  The ever decreasing circuit  size, the increasing packaging density and the massive  commercial demands that have been observed in the past  decade call for innovative design methods to provide  reliable computer usages more efficiently and more  effectively.  Lo and Fujiwara have both previously studied  the efficient design of reliable logic circuits and VLSI  systems.  They have collaborated in a breakthrough work of  defining the quantitative measurements of reliable designs.  This work has opened several new research opportunities to  be explored during this proposed visit.    This proposed research visit will enhance the research in  both U.S. and Japan by bringing together researchers from  both countries in the area of reliable design of logic  circuits and VLSI systems.  Recent result and information  exchange between the researchers from both countries on this  subject can be expected.  Furthermore, this project fulfills  the objectives of transfer of scientific knowledge through  international collaboration between U.S. and Japan.  ***",
