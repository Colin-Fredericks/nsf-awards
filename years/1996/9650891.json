 "awd_abstract_narration": "The current and future growth in telecommunications (National Information Infrastructure) requires technical expertise at all levels to develop, install, and operate the equipment. There are no schools in the midwest that offer a telecommunications program for undergraduate engineering technology students. Educators have recognized the need and have created a specialization in telecommunications. From discussions with GTE Mobilnet, Exxon, Motorola, and EDS, it has become clear that telecommunications and networking professionals are needed. This project expands the communications curriculum and provides a new and innovative advanced communications laboratory.   The project provides for an advanced telecommunications lab consisting of a cellular base station and supporting lab equipment. This equipment is being integrated into the advanced communications curriculum. The project plan has been laid out over several years by the department communications team with the active participation of GTE Mobilnet.   Project goals and objectives include:  developing an advanced communications course sequence for engineering technology students; developing an integrated wireless/cellular telecommunications laboratory; providing industry standard communications equipment for student research and projects; providing hands-on lab experience with high-technology test equipment and simulation software used in the telecommunications industry; promoting new and continued industry involvement in the ongoing development of the communications curriculum; and providing a plan for the continued improvement of the communications curriculum.",
