 "awd_abstract_narration": "The colonization of the Americas and prehistoric movements by Native Americans have been  central issues for American archaeologists. Although research has centered on archaeological  and linguistic evidence, recently genetic evidence has also been applied to these questions.  This  project seeks to utilize mitochondrial DNA extracted from the skeletal material of at least 47  ancient Native Americans, excavated from archaeological sites in the Stillwater Marsh and the  margins of Pyramid Lake in western Nevada which date between approximately 290 and 9500  years before present, to genetically characterize the prehistoric Native Americans of western  Nevada.    Most modern Native Americans belong to one of four maternally inherited mitochondrial  lineages whose frequencies vary significantly among language and geographic groups.  The  distribution of these four mitochondrial lineages among the ancient individuals will be  characterized, as will the existence of any additional lineages.  High resolution sequence data  from the mitochondrial hypervariable region (D-Loop) will also be gathered. Comparison of  these ancient Native Americans to modern Native Americans, based both on the frequency of  mitochondrial lineages and phylogenetic analysis of the sequence data, should contribute to the  resolution of current debates regarding the existence and timing of the spread of modern  Numic-speaking peoples into the Great Basin and the identity of the pre-Numic inhabitants of  that region.  In addition, analysis of these data may help to identify (or delimit) probable Asian  source populations, the presence of founder's effect or a bottleneck, and the number of migration  events contributing to the peopling of the Americas.",
