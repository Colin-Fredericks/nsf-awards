Under this Program, the National Science  Foundation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are jointly  evaluating and supporting research of high priority to the USWRP.           Variations in earth surface properties, such as differential heating and soil  moisture, are known to have a significant impact on numerical weather forecasts.   The Principal Investigator will evaluate the impact of land use and soil moisture on  mesoscale precipitation systems simulated with a high-resolution nonhydrostatic  version of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration s National Center  for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)'s Eta model.  In particular, the role of surface  heat and moisture fluxes in preconditioning the thermodynamic environment and the  dynamical effects of boundary-layer circulations caused by surface inhomogeneities  will be investigated, focusing on orographic and frontal forcing of precipitation.        The nonhydrostatic Eta model will be run over a 24-48 hour time period both  for historical cases and in an operational-like mode.  Historical cases will be chosen  where orography, frontal forcing or local mesoscale convection resulted in unique  precipitation systems whose scales were small enough that nonhydrostatic dynamics  can be assumed to be important.  Initialization and verification of historical cases  can be aided by incorporating archived hourly precipitation data. The operational-  like mode of the project will rely upon the operational initialization and verification  procedures used at NCEP.        Results of the research will contribute to (i) improving our understanding of  the effects of land use and soil moisture on small-scale precipitation systems, and  (ii) testing and refinement of the nonhydrostatic Eta model, which is planned to  be  primary short-range forecasting tool of the future at NCEP.  ***",
