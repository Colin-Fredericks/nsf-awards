 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623468  Maddison        The  role of spider venoms in predation strategies or  defense varies  widely among spiders.  The chemical  composition  of  venoms also  varies  among spider species  and there is  even  evidence  of variation within species.  In this study, we will use a comparative approach  to test  for the influence of ecological demands on  venom  diversification.  We will determine phylogenetic  levels  at  which variation  in venoms  exists,  and then  determine  whether  venom  changes  are  more  pronounced  in  systems  with behavioral  and ecological variability.  First, we will assay nongenetic  variation by  determining the effect on adult venom  expression  that  results from  rearing broodmates  on  different  diets.   Second,  we  will determine  amounts of  variation below the species  level in three  spider  systems:   (1)  Agelenopsis aperta, a  species with  known behavioral differences among populations; (2)  Tegenaria agrestis, a species  with  evidence of  interpopulational differences  in  venom pharmacology; and  (3) populations of Hawaiian Tetragnatha that  are similar  ecologically but isolated on different islands. Finally, we  will  determine venom differences above the species level  and investigate  ecological and behavioral correlates of  these  changes in  Hawaiian  Tetragnatha, a clade which has  undergone a  radiation involving  a shift in foraging behavior.  The ability  to  predict  venom  characteristics, based on phylogenetic position  or ecological circumstances,  would  help to  streamline the ongoing  search  for novel toxins  with useful physiological applications.",
