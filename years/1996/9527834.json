 "awd_abstract_narration": "9527834  KOHN   The use of a novel molecular approach will provide detailed information on the self-incompatibility (S) locus, which controls the rejection of self pollen and acceptance of cross pollen in members of the tomato family (Solanaceae). This genetic locus controls a cellular system of self-recognition and rejection that is only partially understood at present.  DNA sequence information at this locus has so far been limited to rather few, highly divergent, alleles from widely separated species. The S-locus has been little studied at the population level because current technology for determining the genotype of individual plants requires the use of cumbersome crossing methods. Our molecular approach decreases the time needed to sample S-allele diversity within and between populations and provides detailed molecular information from closely related alleles for studying the relationship between DNA sequence change and rejection specificity.    Information on allele number will be used to relate species ecological characteristics to effective population size, a quantity of concern to conservation biologists. Genealogical structure of S-alleles will be used to measure the frequency of historical bottlenecks and test the frequency of one possible mechanism for species formation. Test crosses among plants carrying S-alleles with very similar molecular sequences will help resolve the relationship between sequence variation and the ability to recognize self from non-self pollen. Understanding how sequences control rejection specificity will provide information useful in plant breeding where self-incompatibility limits the breeder's ability to create homozygous inbred lines.",
