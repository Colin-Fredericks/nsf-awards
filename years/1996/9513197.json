 "awd_abstract_narration": "9513197  Song    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Jin-Joo Song, Center for  Laser Research, Oklahoma State University, to pursue with Dr.  Dai-Sik Kim, Department of Physics, Seoul National University,  Korea, for 24 months, a program of cooperative research on  nonlinear laser spectroscopy of semiconductor heterostructures.   In this study, the collaborators plan to investigate recently  found strong femtosecond nonlinearities in wide band gap  materials such as ZnSe, ZnCdSe/ZnSe quantum wells, or GaN, that  are of increasing technological importance.  Femtosecond wave  mixing experiments will be carried out near the exciton resonance  using a second harmonic of a femtosecond Ti:Sapphire laser.   These experiments will be performed varying intensity,  polarization,and temperature on various samples grown under  different conditions and on different substrates.  In order to  study the effect of polarity and band gap on the femtosecond  nonlinearities, the femtosecond nonlinearities of GaN or InGaN  will be investigated.  The effect of changing the band gap on the  femtosecond nonlinearities will be isolated by performing four-  wave mixing experiments under pressure in a diamond anvil cell.   The collaborators expect to obtain a coherent picture of  femtosecond nonlinearities of wide bandgap materials through  these and other novel experiments.    Through their investigations, the collaborators will expand the  frontiers of knowledge of the selected classes of semiconductor  materials, some of which may have useful electronic applications.    The collaborators have considerable complementary research  experience in the field of their proposed project.  This project  is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative  Science Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation  between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the  exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques  and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean  part icipation in the project is supported by the Korea Science  and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  ***",
