 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Colorado's Research Station (MRS) has been  a premier institution supporting  research and teaching for over 70 years.  The primary focus  has been on alpine tundra research,  although the proximity to diverse ecosystems makes the  station a unique geographical location.  The station provides the primary logistical support for the  Niwot Ridge LTER  program, and  facilitates numerous individual investigators and several  federal labs, including EPA, NOAA, and  the National Center for Atomospheric Research as well as  numerous projects supported by NSF  summer courses for undergraduate and high school students,  and is the station a popular site for  academic conferences.  Increased use of the MRS for  research, teaching, and conferences in the  past 5 years has put more of a premium on the availability  of housing, resulting in an inability  of the MRS to accomodate all requests for the use of the  facility.    Housing at the MRS is in rustic, but comfortable cabins and  a hostel.  The majority of the cabins  were built in the 1950's, with only one new built added  between 1960 and 1996.  The  hostel has provided affordable housing for researchers and  students, but its current state requires  replacement, due to utility and safety concerns.  This  project will support construction of a new  hostel to increase housing capacity, provide a new location  for academic meetings, seminars,  classes, and symposia, and provide a winterized year-round  housing facility for researchers  and students.",
