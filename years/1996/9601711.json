 "awd_abstract_narration": "9601711  Klein       Funds are  requested to establish an inductively  coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) facility at Duke  University. The ICP-MS is an ideal  instrument for the  analysis of trace elements, particularly low-abundance trace  elements, in diverse  geological samples.  The  ICP-MS will  be operated as a multi-user  facility and matching funds  have been committed from  Duke University and the University  of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH).  The Duke  Department of Geology has also committed funds toward the  long-term support of a  technician  to maintain the  instrument assist users in obtaining analyses.       The ICP-MS is capable of measuring a wide range of  elements with high precision at high sample throughput and,  as a result, is  being recognized as a major advance in  analytical instrumentation.   Elements now routinely  measured in rock samples include the rare earth elements,  high field  strength elements, heavy alkali elements, U, Th,  and Pb.  The facility will expand analytical capabilities in  virtually every areas of geochemical and environmental  research in the  Research Triangle  are, and will complement  existing analytical facilities at Duke and the University of  North Carolina-Chapel Hill (UNC-CH).       The facility will serve a large and  diverse group of  faculty and students in the Research Triangle area,  including  igneous and metamorphic petrologists, marine  sediment and microfossil geochemists, and environmental  (soil and water) geochemists.  The faculty have a well-  established record of funding and research productivity, and  there is a clear need for an ICP-MS in our  area.  Indeed,  the research of many of our potential users already depends  upon the acquisition of  ICP-MS data at distant facilities  across the country, and the acquisition of an ICP-MS  facility at Duke will allow others to explore new avenues of  research beyond the reach of our present analytical  capabilities.  Furthermore, it is highly desirable that our   numerous graduate students have easy access to the  analytical equipment required for their research so that  they can become well-versed in its use.  Lastly, because we  at Duke and UNC-CH are committed to educating undergraduates  and encouraging them to choose careers in the geosciences,  it is critical that these bright young students have the  opportunity to become involved in research using state-of -  art analytical equipment.  ***",
