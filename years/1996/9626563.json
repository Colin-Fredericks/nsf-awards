 "awd_abstract_narration": "The wavelet transform with symmetric basis functions is emerging as a next-  generation standard for still-image compression.  Wavelet methods outperform the  current JPEG standard at low bitrates, and degrade gracefully with decreasing  bitrate.  The new M-channel symmetric wavelets are used in image and video  coders, with particular attention to quantization strategies and motion  compensation.  This research is addressing the theory, design, and application  of orthogonal and biorthogonal linear-phase M-channel filter banks and M-band  symmetric wavelets.  Multirate filter banks are the fundamental building blocks  for subband and wavelet decompositions, as well as frequency-domain/time-domain  multiplexing.  Theoretical questions being addressed by the research include the  structure of linear-phase M-channel filter banks and wavelets, including a  comprehensive theory of permissible lengths, minimal structures for  parametrization and fast computation, and mappings for two-dimensional signal  processing.  Criteria for wavelet filter design are also being addressed,  including vanishing moments, smoothness and nonnegativity of the scaling  function, and unequal length filters.    The investigators are studying applications of the above to perceptually-based  data compression of image, video and seismic data, multicarrier modulation, and  multiscale feature detections.  They are also investigating the use of the M-band  wavelet transform for multitone modulation.  The frequency partitioning  properties of the M-channel filter bank enable high efficiency for channels such  as twisted-pair copper wire and hybrid fiber-coax, with reduced susceptibility  to narrow-band interference.",
