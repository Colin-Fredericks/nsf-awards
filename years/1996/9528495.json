The workshop is being held in Osaka, Japan, 22-24 January 1996.    The objective is to highlight the key geotechnical issues  involved and provide a mechanism for US-Japan cooperation in  initiating, completing and finally evaluating the information  gathered with the ultimate objective of improving understanding  and in developing methodologies and procedures to mitigate the  effects of future earthquakes.    This workshop is being organized by three Principal Investigators  at different institutions (the University of California at Davis,  the University of Southern California, and Cornell University),  thereby providing wider technical and  geographic coverage within  North America and the increased ability to coordinate and work  with researchers in Japan. Several key researchers in Japan are  cooperating in the planning of this workshop.  It is also being  coordinated with similar activities investigating structural  engineering aspects of the Kobe earthquake.    Emphasis is placed on including as large a participation of North  American and Japanese participants as funding allows, in order to  provide the depth and breadth of knowledge and experience  necessary to accomplish the objectives of the workshop. These  participants include those who have initiated and completed many  research efforts as well as those who have put the results of  such research into practice.  ***",
