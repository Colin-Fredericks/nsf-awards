One group investigating complex fluids is focused on the creation  and control of biomolecular materials. The emphasis is on biomolecular materials whose  microstructure can be controlled for possible applications to the development of heat-proof  proteins, artificial tissue, novel drug delivery systems, and biogels. A second group  investigating solution synthesis of inorganics at molecular and atomic interfaces seeks to  understand basic mechanisms of these processes and to explore the synthesis of new  materials with applications to electro-optics, catalysis, and biotechnology. Heterogeneous  polymeric structures are investigated by a third group. These structures include  heterogeneous block copolymers for potential biomedical applications and network blends for  polymer light-emitting electrochemical cells. Strongly non-equilibri  um phenomena in complex materials are investigated by a fourth group that has a strong  theoretical component focused on issues of practical importance in the materials area with  a common theme of nonlinearity. Planned studies include fundamental mechanisms of friction,  dynamics of fracture, including both conventional fracture and seismic events, the  structural evolution of thin films, and phase transitions in reacting polymers. The MRSEC  supports the development, operation and maintenance of shared experimental facilities for  materials research. It provides seed funding for exploratory research and emerging areas,  and fosters research participation by undergraduates. The MRSEC has strong industrial links  and an educational outreach program. The educational program includes the Science  Partnership for School Innovation and an internship program involving instructors and  students from a local city college. The Center currently supports 30 senior  investigators,  10 postdoctoral research associates, 5 technicians or other professionals, 35 graduate  students, and 25 undergraduates. The MRSEC is directed by Professor Anthony K. Cheetham.  %%%  The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (PARSEC) at the University of  California Santa Barbara supports research in the area of complex materials in four  interdisciplinary groups.
