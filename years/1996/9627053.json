 "awd_abstract_narration": "9627053  Winsten    The Rhode Island Zoological Society will develop, prototype,  install, and evaluate \"Habitrek\", a 3000 sq. ft. exhibit to be  placed in their new Education Center.  The center is a circular  building and as visitors go through it they will encounter habitat  displays of a Urban Providence, Woodlands, Wetlands, and Desert.   In addition there will be giant scale replicas of a wormhole, a bat  cave, a prairie dog colony, and a stream.  Their intent is to use  live animals, animal replicas and interactives to shift the  visitor's emphasis from simply finding and identifying species to  learning about habitats where animals live and where animals and  humans often have to interact.  In addition to the exhibits,  several complementary educational activity packages will be  developed.  These include a family activity pack of activities that  can be completed both at the zoo and in the home.  They will relate  many natural history stories not obvious from the exhibit alone.   To streamline the development process, materials developed by the  Bronx Zoo's Habitat Ecology Learning Program (an NSF-supported  teacher enhancement activity) will serve as the basis for these  family packs.  The HELP materials will also serve as the basis for  activities developed for use by teachers to complement the already  existing Kits in Teaching Elementary Science (KITES) program  (another NSF-supported program).  The zoo also has cooperative  programs with the Rhode Island Girl Scout Council and materials  will be modified for their use as well.  Of special interest is the  attention that is being given to going beyond minimum ADA standards  to make the exhibit broadly accessible.  Ambient sound will be an  important part of all exhibit settings, design considerations will  be made for those with limited vision, and sightlines will be  consistent with wheelchair standards, are a few examples.  The  anticipated exhibit opening is early 1998.",
