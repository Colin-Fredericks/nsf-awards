 "awd_abstract_narration": "95-13714  Sazer  Yeast cells of the species S. pombe respond to nutrient limitation by undergoing a number of physiological and morphological changes that allow the cells to survive the temporary absence of nutrients.  The starvation response in fission yeast includes cell cycle and growth arrest, decreased cell size, enhanced resistance to heat shock and identification of proteins that positively regulate the transition of fission yeast cells from a proliferative state to starvation induced arrest.  A genetic screen will be conducted for the identification of cDNAs which when overexpressed in wild type cells induce the starvation response even in the presence of nutrients.  The rationale behind this approach is that ectopic expression of a key regulatory protein can mimic its normal activation state.  The initial selection will be for cDNAs from growing cells that at high levels of expression induce heat-shock resistance and growth arrest in wild type cells.  Further characterization will include a comparison of the phenotypes of cells overexpressing these cDNAs to wild type cells starved of nutrients, sequence analysis, constuction and analysis of loss of function mutants and determination of the pattern of expression of the genes in wild type cells starved of nutrients.  A small-scale trial of this screen has already yielded positive results:  the identification of 5 novel fission yeast",
