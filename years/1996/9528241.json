 "awd_abstract_narration": "9528241  Karentz  Recently documented global decreases in stratospheric ozone  have brought attention to the potential ecological  consequences of increased ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation in  marine communities. Even without ozone depletion, UVB  radiation penetrating into surface waters of the ocean  represents a biological hazard to many marine organisms. The  most extensive destruction of ozone has been occurring over  the Antarctic continent and Southern Ocean, where over 50%  depletion is recorded each spring.  A major obstacle in  assessing UV effects is that very little is known about the  UV photobiology of individual species.  In the Antarctic,  some of the more ecologically dominant benthic invertebrate  species occupy intertidal and shallow subtidal depths where  biological effects of UVB have already been documented. Many  of these species have planktonic development and their  spawning season coincides with the period when ozone  depletion is occurring; thus their microscopic embryos and  larvae are exposed to increasingly higher levels of UVB.  At  present there is no information on the potential short- or  long-term effects of increased UVB levels on populations of  Antarctic benthic invertebrates.    The research proposed here will focus on the UV photobiology  of three important Antarctic invertebrate species that  inhabit intertidal and subtidal areas in the region of  Palmer Station, Anvers Island, Antarctic Peninsula.  These  species are the limpet Nacella concinna, the sea urchin  Sterechinus neumayeri and the sea star Odontaster validus.  The adults of these species are dominant members of  Antarctic intertidal and shallow subtidal benthic  communities, and their embryos and larvae develop for months  in surface waters from late austral winter through summer.  This study will evaluate the impact of ambient UVB on early  stages (gametes, embryos and larvae) of the life histories  of these species by 1) examining potential UV exposure  levels, 2) assessing differential sensiti vities, 3)  identifying molecular, chromosomal and morphological UVB  induced damage, and 4) evaluating potential protection and  recovery from UVB exposure. Since these species have  taxonomic equivalents at both temperate and tropical  latitudes, this work will provide important biological  parameters for increasing our knowledge about UV effects on  both local and global scales.",
