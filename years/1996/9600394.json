The program's awards  provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of  unique or complementary facilities, expertise and  experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a nine-month postdoctoral research  visit which will support Dr. Robert H. Madden of Duke  University to work with Professor Guiomar Vucetich at the  Universidad Nacional de La Plata in Brazil.  There project  is entitled, \"The Biotic Consequences of Andean Uplift:  Inferences About the Mammalian Fossil Record Based on  Living Rodents and Other Mammals.\"        The purpose of this research is to explore the influence of  Andean orogeny on the Mio-Pliocene faunal record based on  estimates of rainfall and elevation from the composition  and structure of mammalian assemblages.  Inferences about  rainfall and paleoelevation will be based on patterns in  the organization of living mammals distributed along  elevation and rainfall gradients in South America framed in  terms of attributes that can be recognized in the fossil  record.  Of the methods currently available for estimating  rainfall and paleotemperature, faunal methods are probably  the least well-developed, and yet may provide the best  complement to methods based on stable isotopes and fossil  flora.  Faunal methods have been undertaken to distinguish  between major biomes (e.g., grassland vs forest) or to  document departures from modern conditions.  These methods  open the possibility of reconstructing the environmental  history of Andean uplift in South America through the late  Neogene.  The ability to determine estimates of mean annual  rainfall and paleoelevation using the mammalian fossil  record depends on the quality of that record, especially  adequate sampling and modern taxonomic revision to the  species level.  The best available fossil records for the  studies are those o f altiplano Bolivia and northern  Argentina.  ***",
