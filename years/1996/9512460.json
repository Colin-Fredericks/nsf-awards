 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pi  9512460      This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. So Young Pi,    Department of Physics, Boston University, to pursue with   Dr. Hyunsoo Min, Department of Physics, Seoul City University,  for a period of 24 months, a program of cooperative research on  field theories in various dimensions.  Dr. Jae Hyung Yee,  Department of Physics, Yonsei University, will serve in an  advisory capacity with Dr. Min so as to facilitate Dr. Min's  entry into collaborative research with the U.S. scientist.  This  research will address three principal subjects, namely: (1)  finite temperature field theories; (2) dynamics of particles and  solitons in Chern-Simons gauge theories; and (3) low dimensional  gravity theories.  The collaborators expect to use the functional  Schr dinger method, which they will further develop in the  direction of renormalization group, entropy, and bound-state  calculations.    The collaborators expect to produce new and important  understanding of the theoretical structured for field theories in  various dimensions.  Potential benefits include advances in  physical theory and strengthening of the Physics Departments at  both universities.  A special benefit is the likelihood of  attracting outstanding Korean graduate students to do research at  Boston University.  This project is relevant to the objectives of  the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to  increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean  scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific  information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through  collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Dr. Min's  participation in the project is supported by the Korea Science  and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  ***",
