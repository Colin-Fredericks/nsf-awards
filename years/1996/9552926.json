The students will all be from those who are entering either the 11th or 12th grade and are interested in science.   Five of these would be fully supported by the YS program while an additional fifteen would be supported from other sources.  The students would be engaged in active research in the laboratories of their mentors.  In addition they would be strongly encouraged to participate in academic year follow-up activities including a science fair project.  The cost share is 265 % of the request to the Foundation.",
