He was  also awarded a supplement through the Computational  Approaches to Real Materials program.  This research will  focus on the dissipation in spreading, friction, lubrication  and adhesion.  All of these processes are of great  technological importance and each allows basic scientific  issues to be addressed on well-defined model systems that  can be experimentally realized.  Numerical simulations will  be used to provide detailed microscopic information about  the dynamics in each system.  These will be used to develop  analytic theories and to explain and motivate experimental  studies.  %%%  This is a renewal grant from a theorist who was awarded a  Creativity Extension during the last funding period.
