 "awd_abstract_narration": "Individual  probes  and  arrays  of  probes  which  take  advantage  of  thermoelectric  principles to measure and modulate temperature on the cellular level  will be microfabricated with the LIGA process. The LIGA process is a  German-developed process which combines x-ray  lithograpy,electrodeposition, and plastic molding. Within the arrays,  probes for temperature measurement and temperature modulation will be  interspersed according to the requirements for a specific process, and  all probes will be individually addressable. The devices will give the  biologist or bioengineer highly localized control of the temperature  over large areas, or monitor  temperatures at many locations in the same volume. In addition to being  independent  instruments for thermal and energetic studies of biological systems,  the probes and probe arrays can become basic components in instruments  requiring fine thermal control to assist in other investigations.    Thermoelectric  probes for temperature measurement  are  based  on  the  Seebeck effect, and in the form of thermocouples are common sensor. The  new development in this proposal will be the microfabrication of arrays  of  thermocouples  at  the cellular level or  over  a  broad  range  of  dimensions   above  that.  Probes  and  probe  arrays  for  temperature  modulation  based on the Peltier effect will also be a new develcpment.  Prior   applications   of  thermoelectric  heating   and   cooling   in  microsystems  have been limited by material issues.  Materials  with  a  suitable  figure  of merit for use in Peltier effect  elements  include  bismuth  and its alloys, which can be electrodeposited as one  step  in  the LIGA process, overcoming those constraints. By taking advantage  of  the  high  aspect  ratio  microfabrication  capabilities  of  the  LIGA  process,  probes  combining  Peltier and Seebeck  capabilities  can  be  produced.    The  principal investigators and their collaborators are members of the   LSU  Microsystems Engineering Team (IlSET), which is one of the leading  groups in LIGA process microfabrication in the United States. The  team  has  the use of the synchrotron x-ray source at the Center for Advanced  Microstructures  and  Devices (CAMD) at LSU,  which  is  currently  the  premiere  x-ray  lithography facility in the world.  In  related  work,  IlSET  investigators have produced arrays of scanning probe  microscope  (SPM) tips with initial diameters as small as 2 micrometers and heights  up  to  15  micrometers. With the LIGA microfabrication process  probes  with  extremely high aspect ratios may be fabricated with single layers  as  deep  as  one  millimeter.  The  spacing  and  arrangement  of  the  thermocouples on a substrate will be a design variable open  to  change  with each application.    The proposed instruments will give biologists and bioengineers powerful  new  tools  for  studying  and  manipulating  cellular  systems.  Three  representative  areas  of  application  are:  (1  )  Cryobiology,   (2)  Neuroscience, (3) Metabolic studies of cellular systems. The  Pls  have  contacted and discussed applications and possible collaboration in  the  first   two  areas  with  investigators  in  those  fields.  Additional  relationships  will be developed as the design and fabrication  of  the  probes progresses.",
