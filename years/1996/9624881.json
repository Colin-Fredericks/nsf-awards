 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Faculty Early Career project, the research part of which deals   with titanium dioxide as a photooxidation catalyst for environmental   remediation by degradation.  The project will study the organic   intermediate buildup and decay during titanium dioxide catalyzed   photooxidation.  Many groups have studied titanium dioxide for the   present purposes but the usual approach is to investigate the initial   step and to assume that subsequent intermediates are rapidly mineralized.   Use of titanium dioxide with dilute solutions of toxics (as in the real   world one must) will leave intermediates largely to decay spontaneously   and the biological consequences will only be known when the nature and   concentrations of the intermediates are known.  The project will be one   of only a few, and the only led by a synthetic chemist, using this   approach.  The  educational work centers on making students more active   participants in the learning process.  Dr. Jenks will develop   undergraduate laboratory experiments along the lines of this research.  In this project the intermediates in one possible future technology,   catalyzed light-induced decomposition of organic environmental   contaminants, will be studied. The project will provide information from   which the possibility of introduction of biohazards will be studied. The   project will also emphasize student-centered learning and the integration   of this research into undergraduate laboratory teaching.",
