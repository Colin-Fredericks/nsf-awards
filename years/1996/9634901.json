 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research develops a generalized methodology for modeling,  simulation and design of systems that intentionally or inherently  involve switching phenomena. Physical switches are ubiquitous in  physical and engineering problems, and their effects are realized  in stick-slip friction, clutching processes, power electronic  switching, hydraulic valving, and other critical processes. The  research methodology integrates bond-graph representations and  wave-scattering formalisms. The wave-scattering approach makes  possible a formulation for a physical switching element that  includes the ideal switch behavior as a special case. Further,  integration of switching system representations with distributed-  parameter elements and thermodynamic considerations is made  possible as well. Because the scattering formulation can be  integrated seamlessly with a bond graph approach, a methodology  can be developed for representing the physical topology of a wide  class of multi-energy domain systems. The results from this work  will make a significant impact on computer-aided modeling,  simulation, and design of a large class of systems and physical  processes. Small-scale laboratory testing will be used to qualify  and evaluate the approach and methods. In addition, a  collaboration with the Center for Electromechanics at the  University of Texas at Austin and the center's industrial and  federal partners will make available experimental and research  development resources for  testing these techniques in high-  performance switching controllers for traction motors. Ongoing  collaboration with research personnel in the automotive industry  provides another opportunity to tailor and assess the capability  of the research results to industrially significant problems.",
