The main issue concerns the   possibility of stabilizing a system in the absence of complete information about  the system. For instance, a feedback control which stabilizes a system might  have unmodeled small time delays in the feedback loop that adversely affect  the stability of the system.  It is therefore important to determine when and  how this occurs, and to decide what modifications in the feedback loop are  needed to alleviate the problem.  A related issue concerns systems in which the  only data available for use in a control design is a sampled-data observation of  the actual system, or a numerical approximation of that system. This research  will determine when stabilization of an unknown system is possible based on  such limited information. The approach taken is system theoretic in the sense  that results are developed for a large class of abstract state space systems and  frequency domain systems, and then applied to vibration control problems for  specific systems.  Many of the problems require approaches which combine  partial differential equation techniques, frequency domain techniques and state  space techniques.  %%%  One of the principal issues in the design of stabilizing feedbacks for vibrating  systems is that of design of a feedback control based on incomplete  information of the system.  An important paradigm of such a system occurs in  structural acoustics.  In this problem, sound waves are present within a cavity,  such as an airplane cabin, and part of the boundary of the cavity is subject to  vibrations due, for example, to an aircraft engine mounted near one of the walls  of the cabin.  Wall vibrations may either amplify or attenuate the sound waves,  and one of the applications of this research is to use the wall vibrations to  accomplish the latter.  Modern techniques used to accomplish this use  piezoceramic patches th at impart bending moments on the vibrating wall when  voltages are applied to them.  Numerical experiments suggest that some of  these stabilization schemes may be rendered ineffective by very small time  delays that naturally arise in the feedback loop.  Such delays cannot be  precisely determined, so it is important to decide what modifications in the  feedback loop are needed to alleviate the problem.  This project is will address  precisely such issue in the general context of stabilization of infinite-  dimensional vibrating systems based on incomplete information of the system,  or based on sampled data.  ***",
