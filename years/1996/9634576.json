 "awd_abstract_narration": "The foci of this research are twofold.  The experimental projects will   focus on the investigating the physical and chemical properties of   pyramidalized alkenes, obtaining photodetachment spectra of the radical   anions of several of these molecules and of the radical anion of   cyclobutadiene, and attempting to observe a derivative of   cyclopentane-2-one-1,3-diyl in matrix isolation.  The computational   research will include studies of stereomutations of cyclopropane and   geminally disubstituted derivatives, potential surfaces for several other   types of organic reactions, geometries of and energy differences between   electronic states of both di- and triradicals, substituent and solvent   effects on C-H and O-H bond dissociation energies, strain in paddlanes   and the differences between the chemistry of phenylnitrene and   phenylcarbene.  With this accomplishment based renewal award, the   Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Weston T.   Borden of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Washington.    Professor Borden will focus his work on the study of highly strained   organic molecules.  The combination of both experimental and theoretical   methodology can offer new insights to the types of bonding that carbon   can undergo.",
