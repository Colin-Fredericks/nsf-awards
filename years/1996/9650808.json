 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves upgrading the observing facilities at the Astronomy Department. Recently, the capabilities of charged coupling devices (CCD), such as cameras, computers, and telescopes, have dramatically increased while prices have remained stable or even decreased. This has led to a great increase in the \"user-friendliness\" of realizable observing systems. The project can capitalize on this state of affairs by providing state-of-the-art CCD camera systems with powerful computers and computer-assisted telescopes for use in the lower- and upper-divisional undergraduate laboratories. This upgrade in equipment provides additional possibilities for the astronomy majors, opens up new approaches for general students taking astronomy as an elective, and presents a new dimension for people coming to observatory Open House. This project represents a great enhancement to the observing possibilities currently available, as well as a variety of new types of instruction, laboratory projects, and opportunities for undergraduate education.",
