 "awd_abstract_narration": "Morris  9623288  Admissible representations of reductive groups over local fields  have been the object of study for some time by virtue of the  Langlands program relating them to local and global number  theory.  Among these representations, the supercuspidal  representations have always played a distinguished role as  building blocks.  One way to construct them is via induction from  compact open subgroups, and this has led to the philosophy of  studying admissible representations of a reductive group by  restricting them to appropriate compact open subgroups.  Bushnell  and Kutzko have applied this philosophy with great success to the  general or special linear groups; this has led them to formalize  it via the very general notion of S-types.  This approach has  also been successful in studying the smooth representations of an  arbitrary reductive group that contains a fixed vector under the  prounipotent radical of some parahoric subgroup (the \"level zero  case\").  Finally, preliminary results suggest this approach can  work more generally for other groups.  The PI will continue his  investigations in this area, and in particular, he will consider  the following topics: (a) The study of S-types for classical  groups; in particular the classification of the admissible dual  of classical groups, (b) Applications of (a) to the study of the  reducibility of generalized principal series of classical groups  and related arithmetic, (c) Further study of problems arising  from the level zero case; in particular, the classification of  the level zero part of the  admissible dual in terms of Langlands  parameters and applications of level zero S-types to the study of  reducibility and R-groups.  The Langlands program is part of  number theory.  Number theory is the study of the properties of  the whole numbers and is the oldest branch of mathematics.  From  the beginning problems in number theory have furnished a driving  force in creating new mathematics in other diverse parts of the  discipline.  Th e Langland's program is a general philosophy that  connects number theory with calculus; it embodies the modern  approach to the study of whole numbers.  Modern number theory is  very technical and deep, but it has had astonishing applications  in areas like theoretical computer science and coding theory.",
