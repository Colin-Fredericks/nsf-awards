 "awd_abstract_narration": "95-60695  Cieslinski   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project provides a plan to develop early prototype devices to implant erythropoietin-producing cells in an animal to treat erythropoietin deficient anemias.  Erythropoietin is a hormone produced in specialized cells in the kidney and is released when oxygen delivery to these cells declines secondary to hypoxia or anemia. thereby stimulating red cell progenitor proliferation to increase red blood cell volume in the circulation.  This hormone is deficient in many chronic diseases, including chronic renal failure, AIDs and cancer.  This formulation will ultimately be cost effective (current annual cost is $1.5 billion) as well as a more optimal treatment strategy for this disease process.  Accordingly, the project aims to construct an early hollow fiber prototype to immunoisolate cells of an established human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, which produces erythropoietin in an oxygen sensitive manner for implantation into the systemic circulation of an animal.  The project has three specific aims: 1) To identify the best geometry of hollow fiber encapsulation of HepG2 cells to grow to maximum packed cell density without compromise of cell viability in vitro; and once optimum hollow fiber geometry is determined; 2) To demonstrate that erythropoietin gene expression and protein production by these encapsulated cells in a single hollow fiber bioreactor can be regulated by varying oxygen tension or oxygen carrying capacity in vitro; and 3) To scale up these studies to a cartridge of encapsulated cells in a hundred hollow fibers in order to test viability and oxygen responsivity ex vivo in preparation for cartridge implantation of encapsulated HepG2 cells into the systemic circulation of an animal in vivo during the phase II component of this program.  This Phase I project will, therefore, support the important transition phase from basic to applied research and the preliminary design of a testable device designed to provide cell therapy f or erythropoietin deficient anemias.   The ultimate goal of this research is to produce a cell therapeutic device to treat erythropoietin deficient anemia.  This technology may optimize the treatment of anemia of patients on dialysis in a cost effective manner, with a potential cost savings in the hundreds of millions of dollars.",
