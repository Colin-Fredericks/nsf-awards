 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vote-by-mail (VBM) offers exciting new possibilities for expanding the effective size of the electorate and doing so at less cost to the taxpayer.  Local VBM experiments have cost far less than typical voting booth elections and turnout has risen substantially.  In January 1996, this procedure will used statewide for the first time to determine the replacement for Oregon Senator Robert Packwood.  This research will focus on public reactions to VBM and its potential to increase turnout in future elections.  A post-election poll of 1200 Oregon voters will be conducted at the conclusion of the election.  This study will provide a critical test of structural theories on the underlying problems with voter turnout in America.  The project also has immediate practical application.  The state of Oregon will consider legislation to establish VBM as standard practice in future elections if public reactions and efficiency assessments of the January 1996 election are favorable.  * * *",
