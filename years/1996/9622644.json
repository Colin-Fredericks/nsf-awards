Leonards and Patrick J. Fox, Department  of Civil  Engineering, Purdue University      The objective of the proposed research program is to provide  definitive  experimental data to resolve long-standing issues of strain  rate effects  during the process of consolidation in clay.  Novel  experimental techniques  will be applied to measure the time-dependent and time-  independent  components of compressibility both during and after the  consolidation  process is completed, without the need for analytical  interpretation of the  test results.  Undisturbed soils, known to be sensitive to  strain rate  effects, will be tested  using: 1) a fixed-ring  consolidometer specially  treated for low sidewall friction, and 2) a Ko-triaxial cell  modified to  provide essentially one-dimensional strain under conditions  of zero side  friction, using a flow-pump volume control system.  Local  values of void  ratio and effective stress will be measured directly.  Large  ranges in  strain rate will be investigated by testing samples of  different thickness.  Redundant experiments will be used to establish that the  results are free  from bias due to minor departures from zero side friction in  one case, and  from zero lateral strain in the other.  With the basic  constitutive  relations obtained from direct measurement, predictions of  pore water  pressure dissipation in incremental loading tests, and build  up of pore  water pressures in constant rate of strain (CRS) tests, will  be compared  with those using replicate specimens from block samples.  The results of  this study will have a fundamental bearing on how  consolidation concepts  are taught, and on how they are applied in practice.",
