 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514398  Brewer  Social identities are those aspects of an individual's self   concept that derive from his or her membership in   emotionally significant social groups.  Optimal   distinctiveness theory is an extension of self-  categorization theory, developed by the PI to account for   why individuals seek identification with social groups and   to explain the role of social identities in achieving and   maintaining a stable self-concept.  The theory is based on   the thesis that distinctiveness per se is a factor   underlying the selection and strength of social identities,   independent of the positive evaluation associated with   membership in particular social categories.  It is proposed   that social identities are selected and activated to the   extent that they help the individual to achieve a balance   between feelings of inclusion and feelings of   distinctiveness in a given social context.  The purpose of   the proposed program of research is to explore the   implications of optimal distinctiveness theory for   psychological processes at the individual level.  Nine sets   of experiments are proposed that are designed to test the   consequences of seeking and maintaining optimal group   identification for (a) self evaluation, (b) self   stereotyping and the content of the self concept, (c)   presentation of the self to others, and (d) protection of   ingroup identity through differentiation from outgroups.    Together these experiments will serve to test the validity   of the fundamental assumptions about social motivation   underlying optimal distinctiveness theory.  %%%  The purpose of this program of research is to investigate   the consequences of group membership for the formation,   maintenance, and change of a person's self-concept and sense   of self-worth.  It is designed to test the theory that   opposing needs for belonging (similarity to others) and   distinctiveness (differentiation from others) shape   individual identity and attitudes toward their own and other   socia l groups.  An adaptive self-concept satisfies both   needs simultaneously.  Failure to meet either produces   anxiety and instability of the self-concept   (disequilibrium).  A series of experiments is proposed,   designed to assess the effects of such disequilibrium on   individual self-esteem and prejudice toward members of other   social groups.  ***",
