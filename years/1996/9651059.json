 "awd_abstract_narration": "The science faculty at this college believe that a basic knowledge of biological concepts and an awareness of the relevance and applicability of these concepts to current social issues is essential for students to make responsible life choices. The goal of this project is to provide students with the tools and activities to help them develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making skills that will help them achieve this knowledge and awareness. The project utilizes computer-based inquiry-learning activities and computer technology to enhance student learning in several so-called emphasis biology classes for nonmajors.   The biology faculty is collaborating with faculty in the University of Oregon's Workshop Biology project to customize existing learning activities and develop new ones for these unique emphasis classes and for the nontraditional student population.   The college has not previously had enough equipment to implement these activities effectively. However, the equipment makes it possible to install computers in three classrooms so that students may work collaboratively in a variety of learning activities which foster problem-solving and critical thinking. In addition, a computer resource center with 16 computers is being set up to allow independent use outside of classtime.   The project is being evaluated through pre- and post-testing and surveys to determine the degree to which students have developed critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making skills. Through dissemination, this project can serve as a model for other schools to develop their own computer-enhanced biology curricula.",
