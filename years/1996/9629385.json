 "awd_abstract_narration": "Millard H. Alexander of The University of Maryland at College Park and   Paul J. Dagdigian of Johns Hopkins University are supported by the   Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to continue their collaborative   studies of the dynamics of nonreactive collisions involving diatomic free   radicals, with an emphasis on electronically nonadiabatic processes.    They will study weakly bound complexes of the radicals and the   predissociation of these complexes in order to gain further information   on the underlying potential energy surfaces.  The theoretical effort   involves development and application of new methods for elucidating the   mechanism of molecular collisions and photodissociation, ab initio   calculation of the potential energy surfaces and nonadiabatic coupling   matrix elements, and full quantum calculations of cross sections and rate   constants and the determination of bend-stretch levels of weakly-bound   complexes.  The experimental effort involves the determination of   state-to-state inelastic cross sections for energy transfer processes and   the spectroscopy and dynamics of rare gas-diatomic van der Waals   complexes.    The dominant theme of their research is the influence of electronic   angular momentum and/or spin on inelastic energy transfer and   photodissociation.  During a collision, or during the breakup of a   molecule, the internal electronic angular momenta will couple with the   motion of the nuclei and hence influence product branching ratios and   inelastic propensities.  Therefore, a thorough understanding of this   coupling mechanism should ultimately lead to a better understanding of   how to optimize the desired products in chemical reactions.",
