 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid prototyping environments provide high-level operations that  allow users rapidly to create and modify interactive  applications, such as graphical interfaces, scientific and  program visualizations, and simulations (i.e., quickly program  the Obig pictureO). These environments often sacrifice speed and  storage for increased flexibility. Researchers have proposed  optimizations that can reduce storage and improve performance.  However, the programmer must manually apply these optimizations,  which impedes rapid, iterative development of applications.  The  objective of  this project is to develop adaptive, profile-based  compilation techniques that automatically apply these  optimizations so that the programmer can make use of rapid  prototyping techniques while still retaining excellent time and  storage performance. Constraints and structured graphics are  targeted by this research since studies show that these two  techniques facilitate the rapid, iterative development of  graphical user interfaces. This project is developing techniques  whereby: (1) a profiler monitors operations as they execute and  extracts information about constraint evaluation and variable  access, and (2) an adaptive compiler uses this information to  dynamically implement various performance and storage  optimizations.  ***",
