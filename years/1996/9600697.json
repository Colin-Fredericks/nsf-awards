 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in theoretical physics will be aimed at  furthering our understanding of the laws governing the  interactions of the elementary particles at very small  distances. These interactions include the force of gravity  and three other fundamental forces. For the non-  gravitational forces (electromagnetism, the strong nuclear  force, and the `weak` force responsible for certain  radiation processes), we have the powerful `standard model,`  which nevertheless leaves a number of questions open.  Foremost among these questions are the issue of the origin  of the masses of the elementary particles, and the fact that  free quarks are never seen. These problems, and in  particular the puzzle of the very large mass of the recently-  discovered top quark, will be addressed.  A major effort  will be made to understand the basic forces of nature when  they become strong, and the time-honored techniques, which  depend on these forces being weak, fail. This effort will  include the use of ideas centering on the concept of  `duality` between electricity and magnetism, and extensions  of this concept. Related concepts arise when, to include  gravity, one pictures the elementary particles as the  excited states of extremely small strings. Duality within  string theory, and other aspects of sting theory, will be  pursued. The studies to be included in the research program  are very important to improving our understanding of the  elementary particles and the fundamental forces.",
