 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS-9632739    A new approach for the detection of the Doppler wavelength shift and a corresponding new instrument (Doppler Fluorescence Velocimetry, DFM) for single and  two-phase flow velocity measurements will be investigated.  The Doppler shift is transformed into  wave intensity ratio by collecting the laser beams into a fluorescence chamber.  The signal is projected on a black background, from where a fast-color-switcher with an acoustic-optic-tunnel filter is used to measure the intensity ratio.  Two systems, a point velocimeter with a photomultiplier tube and a planar velocimeter with a CCD array, will be simultaneously constructed and tested.  It is expected that the sensitivity and the signal-to-noise ratio will increase significantly.  If successful, the system will allow for higher frequency response and simpler operation with out  system alignment.  The objective of the project is to prove the feasibility of the concept, and to find the most suitable areas of application.    The proposed concept may lead to significant increase in versality and efficiency of velocity measurements in some conditions as compared to the laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV), Phase-Doppler anemometry (PDA), and particle image velocimetry (PIV).  ***",
