The work  involves construction of balanced sections  using surface outcrops, drilling and seismic  reflection profiles, mapping of Quaternary  deposits, trenching and geomorphic analysis of  river profiles.  This research is in  collaboration with the Wadia Institute of  Himalayan Geology and the Oil and Natural Gas  Commission of India.  Results are of  fundamental interest and considerable utility  in the assessment of potential earthquake  hazards in the Himalayan foothills of northwest  India.     Scope:  The project requires dollar funding for  data interpretation and training of Indian  scientists in the US and Indian currency to  support travel to India and to supplement field  research costs.  Government of India Clearance  for this collaborative project allows US  scientists to conduct field work  in sensitive  border areas of the Himalayas.       ***",
