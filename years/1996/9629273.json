Feeder reconfiguration for transformer and feeder load balancing  is an effective control action both for avoiding outages and for  faster restoration.  Load balancing is particularly important  today since many of these devices (transformers and feeders) have  been in service for many decades, in most cases.  Replacement  or even reinforcement of these aging facilities is difficult due  to the emphasis on cost reduction due to competition.  Load  balancing will help minimize failures of these devices thereby  preventing outages.          Feeder reconfiguration is a combinatorial optimization  problem with multiple conflicting objectives and nonlinear  constraints.  Not surprisingly, it continues to be an active  research area since many local optima exist and the aim is to  find the globally optimal Pareto surface that reflects the  tradeoff between the objectives.  So, we are not just looking for  one global optimum (which itself would be difficult to obtain  efficiently), but we are looking for many such solutions that  form the Pareto surface. Many solution approaches have been  suggested, but none appears to be totally up to the task.   Heuristics are inevitable; the question is: which ones?          Our proposed approach is based on this observation:  multiple heuristics and algorithms working together (in parallel)  might be more effective than any one of them working in  isolation.  We call each individual algorithm/heuristic, an  agent.  In this context, the term agent refers to the ability of  the individual algorithms to \"cooperate\" with each other,  enabling a synergistic enhancement of their isolated  capabilities.  Such an approach has proved useful for other  combinatorial optimization problems, including some in the power  systems area, and hence, there is reason to believe  that it will  be successful for feeder reconfiguration as well.  We propose to  demonstrate that our multi-agent approach is able to obtain the  Pareto set of optimal solutions for this problem with a  computational effort acceptable for online operational planning  purposes (if not real-time).  We also propose to develop a  theoretical framework, based on Markov chains, for analyzing the  computational behavior of our multi-agent approach with a view  towards providing insights into its performance, its scalability  to large distribution systems, and its applicability to similar  combinatorial problems in power systems.          Three results are of particular interest: 1) the  \"convergence\" of the solutions in the memory towards the global  optimum as time progresses; 2) the decrease in the value of the  most important objective towards the global optimum as agents are  added one by one, 3) the \"speedup\" (decrease in overall execution  time) obtained as more processors are added (we expect a  near-linear speedup).          Finding the optimal feeder reconfiguration strategy is a  multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem that is  difficult to solve in the online environment.  The proposed  multi-agent approach has the potential of offering an effective  way of combining, various heuristics in a synergistic fashion so  as to obtain the Pareto surface for the conflicting objectives.   By improving both the overall solution quality  and the  computational time, the approach will significantly advance the  state-of-the-art in feeder reconfiguration research and practice.   Further, since the approach is inherently parallel, it can take  maximal advantage of the distributed computing platforms that are  becoming commonplace in distribution control centers.          The applicability of the multi-agent approach and of the  Markov chain model extend beyond the feeder reconfiguration  problem.  The utility of similar approaches to a couple of other  power system problems has been reported in  the literature.  This  proposed research will lay the foundations for a theoretical and  an experimental framework for answering the important question:  Given that there are various algorithms and heuristics for  solving this difficult problem, what is the best approach for  combining them such as to extract a better performance than any  of them is capable of, in isolation? Answering this question  successfully has fundamental value for advancing the practice of  solving combinatorial problems in the power industry.  ***",
