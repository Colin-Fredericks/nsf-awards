 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to study infant care behavior in the spectral tarsier, Tarsier spectrum.  Spectral  tarsiers are small, nocturnal, insectivorous primates found only on the island of Sulawesi,  Indonesia.  Spectral tarsiers exhibit a very unusual parental care strategy whereby the mother  transports her infant in her mouth ant then `parks` it on branches throughout the forest.  It has  been suggested that the exceptionally large size of the infant relative to the mother prevents her  from transporting it on her chest or back as observed in most other primates.  The goal of the  study is to ascertain how long the infant is left alone, if other group members babysit parked  infants, the distance between the parked infants, mothers and other group members.  In addition,  other aspects of infant development, including a very lengthy gestation period, will be monitored.   Continuous observations of mothers will be accomplished through the assistance of radio  telemetry equipment.",
