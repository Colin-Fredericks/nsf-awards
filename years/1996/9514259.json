In large part, this is due to the spatial averaging inherent in many biochemical approaches and the loss of temporal resolution in ultrastructural studies requiring chemical fixation. Fluorescent probe and optical microscope techniques developed over the past decade have made it possible to study an increasing number of molecular and biochemical processes in living cells. We are using these techniques to characterize the organization of glycolysis in living cells. The glycolytic enzymes aldolase, phosphofructokinase (PFK), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) have been shown to interact with each other and/or structural proteins in vitro, and a variety of specif1c reagents can now be used to study their behavior in vivo. We are studying the intracellular distribution and mobility of each of these enzymes, and the interactions among these enzymes in vitro and in vivo will be characterized extensively. We have also found that the glycolytic enzyme enolase lacks specific interactions in vitro and in vivo, and we will use enolase as a reference molecule in our experiments.  Aldolase is concentrated in a microdomain around F-actin stress fibers in fibroblasts, and a fraction of the enzyme is bound in vivo as measured with fluorescence photobleaching (FRAP). This finding is inconsistent with the textbook description of glycolysis occurring as a series of fully solvated, diffusion limited reactions in cytoplasm, and consistent with a growing number of models for organized glycolytic metabolism. Recent work from several laboratories has led to the identification of an actinbinding domain on the aldolase molecule, based on biochemical and molecular genetic studies of aldolase interactions in vitro. We ar e using site-directed mutants of rabbit muscle aldolase to study the effect of specific mutations on aldolase dynamics in vivo; both catalytic activity and actin-binding activity mutants have been obtained and characterized. There is also evidence that PFK and GAPDH bind to F-actin and may interact with aldolase in vitro. We will map the distribution and mobility of these enzymes in vivo, and we will use a panel of site-specific monoclonal antibodies and synthetic peptides corresponding to putative catalytic and actin interaction sites on PFK and GAPDH to study the effects of these sites on intracellular organization of the enzymes. Similar reagents for aldolase are currently under development. Finally, we will use fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to ask whether or not indirect \"piggyback\" binding of TPI to F-actin occurs in vivo, consistent with solution biochemical evidence, and to evaluate interactions between/among all four enzymes.  We will use an interdisciplinary approach, with biochemical characterization of reagents prior to their use in vivo; electron microscopy, falling ball viscometry, fluorescence photobleaching, and FRET measurements to quantify enzyme/actin interactions in vitro; and microinjection, fluorescence imaging, fluorescence photobleaching, and fluorescence energy transfer experiments in vivo. Characterization of the dynamics of glycolysis will improve our understanding of cytoplasm, and of the ways in which biochemical reactions are organized and regulated in vivo. The long term goal of this research is to improve our ability to mimic cytoplasmic functions in advanced biomaterials, and to provide intelligent structural and metabolic support for nanotransport and nanofabrication molecular machinery.  %%%  Much modern biology is based on the study of fixed specimens and dilute biochemical reactions. While this approach has been very valuable, it has limits as we probe the molecular nature of living cells ever more closely. For example, many biochemical and bio physical techniques are optimized for studying strong interactions between molecules, but weak molecular interactions are extremely important biochemically, though inherently more difficult to study. New technology has enabled the development of techniques to study some aspects of biochemical pathways directly in living cells. While technologically difficult, this approach has the important benefit of allowing us to begin to ask questions about the elegant and precise way in which cells orchestrate biochemical reactions. The goal of this project is to study the organization and behavior of several glycolytic enzymes in living cells. These enzymes are generally believed to exist as molecules freely dissolved in cytoplasm, but much recent evidence has suggested that they may exist partially in the solid state. The possibility that this basic and ubiquitous biochemical pathway may exist in an unusual state warrant direct investigation in living cells. We will microinject tracer quantities of active enzymes labeled with specific dyes that can be used to trace their location and movement in living cells. Digital imaging technology will be coupled to advanced light microscope techniques to map the organization and mobility of these molecules in a variety of metabolic states.       The significance of this work is three-fold. First, it is clear that much biochemistry generally treated as occurring in solution may have more complex organization, perhaps including a degree of solid state basis. Characterizing and understanding the molecular organization of these reactions is one of the important challenges remaining for many biochemical pathways. Second, molecular organization of biochemical pathways may provide a link between biochemical logic and three-dimensional cytoplasmic organization. Documenting structural roles for enzymes in living cells, in addition to catalytic roles, will enhance our understanding of cytoplasmic organization, and shed new light on processes as basic as cell motility. Third,  the rules by which nature has optimized biochemical function are clearly very elegant and sophisticated relative to the crude biochemical machinery we are capable of reconstituting today. Identifying these rules may allow us to incorporate more sophisticated design features into molecular machinery designed to mimic natural systems. This will ultimately lead to the development of advanced biomaterials, and perhaps new applications for nanotransport/nanofabrication molecular machinery.   ***",
