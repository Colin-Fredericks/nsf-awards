 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630095  Sollitt  The objectives of the project are to make breakaway walls,  used in coastal areas subjected to the wind and wave actions  of hurricanes, predictable, safer and functional.  This work  will improve the understanding of load-wall-structure  interactions and the results will minimize uncertainties in  wall design and construction.  Four tasks were identified to  accomplish these objectives and they are: first, to  determine the behavior and capacity of wall panels and  connections; second, to predict the response of parent  structure to environmental loads transmitted by wall  connections; third, to improve the ability to quantify  environmental loads acting on breakaway walls as well as the  response and modes of failure of walls interacting with  these extreme loads; and fourth, to improve the design and  construction processes of breakaway walls by incorporating  knowledge garnered in the three previous tasks and by  validating the models developed with these experimental  results.  The first two tasks are currently underway at  North Carolina State University (NCSU).  The third task will  be undertaken under the present project, and the last task  will incorporate the results of the first three tasks and  will be conducted at NCSU.  ***",
