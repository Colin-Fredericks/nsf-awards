 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for the support of a workshop designed to  objectively describe, distribute and sample core and outcrop  material recently recovered from the Sirius Group deposit at Mt.  Feather, Antarctica.  The Mt. Feather deposit has been  extensively studied by other investigators and it is thought to  be one of the key sites that will help resolve the debate about  the Pliocene glacial and climatic history of Antarctica.  Recently, a flurry of international meetings and publications has  seen criticism of the techniques, findings, and reproducibility  of data sets from investigations pertaining to this history. The  material sampled during this workshop will be distributed to  investigators who have registered interest in the project and  results from this work will be published in a communal report  which will form the basis for a group publication on the combined  findings of all investigators.  Separate concurrent publications  will include a description of the sample collection techniques  and the geologic setting of the deposit.",
