An approach based on the connection between embedding  of Banach spaces into Lp, positive definite functions and stable  measures was discovered by P. Levy in the 30's, and since then   has been under intensive development. The author's contributions  to this direction include a solution to the 1938 Schoenberg's   problem on positive definite functions, construction of common  subspaces of Lp-spaces, a Fourier transform criterion of isometric  embedding into Lp contributing to the 1937 P. Levy's problem,   a solution to the isometric version of the 1969 Kwapien's problem   on Banach subspaces of Lp with p less than 1. All these results   were obtained by using methods of Fourier analysis. The project   addresses open problems in this direction. The problems include   the description of positive definite norm dependent function,   the related question on the existence of isotropic measures   which are not mixtures of stable measures, characterization of   subspaces of Lp and zonoids, isomorphic versions of Kwapien's   problem and the problem on common subspaces, application of the  Fourier transform to computing the Banach-Mazur distance,  connections between the Fourier transform of norms and duality  of Banach spaces, and between the Fourier transform and the volume  of sections of the unit ball. The problem of extending the Fourier   transform technique to certain infinite dimensional situations   has applications to stochastic processes and electrical engineering.        The Fourier transform, as a method of decomposing a signal into   a combination of simple frequencies, has proved to be  an important tool in different areas of mathematics, physics,  engineering and statistics. The author has been working on  applications of the Fourier transform to the Banach space theory  for more than ten years, and  his contributions include a solution  to the Schoenberg problem on positive definite functions which had   been open since 1938, extension of the Fourier transform technique to   infinite dimensional situations, construction of common subspaces of Banach  spaces and other results. Work in this direction provides  important connections between functional analysis, harmonic analysis  and probability theory. For example, calculating the Fourier transform  of a norm one can find the volume of sections of convex bodies in  spaces of arbitrary dimension, or construct random variables  which are stable under summation. Situations where one has to calculate   the Fourier transform of the norm (distance) of a Banach space occur  in different applied areas. For example, if it is impossible to   measure a signal directly, and one only has the information about   the distance from the signal to fixed functions in the norm of a certain  Banach space, then one of the ways to identify the signal is to  solve a certain convolution equation involving the norm, which can  usually be solved using the Fourier transform technique. This happens  when, because of noise, one can only see the maximum of a signal   (the supremum-norm), which often happens in electrical engineering.  In the study of the strength of fibers, it is important   to find the frequencies of the main defects while one can not  measure the strength at every point and only knows the weakest  points of certain pieces of the material. Finding the spectral  function of the strength is an example of how the Fourier  transform of norms works for the study of materials.",
