 "awd_abstract_narration": "Zabludoff - Abstract      Two  of  the  fundamental questions in astronomy  today  are  how  structures  form in the galaxy distribution and  to  what  extent  environment affects galaxy evolution.  Surprising results from an  on-going survey of five nearby galaxy clusters (Zabludoff et  al.  1995) underscore the power of observing clusters of galaxies  for  data  to  understand these issues.  The research will consist  of  observations  of  three  unique,  carefully  chosen  samples   of  clusters of galaxies and smaller groups of galaxies.  The results  from  the  observations will be used to, 1)  to  place  stringent  constraints  on  how  clusters  of  galaxies  form  and  on   the  cosmological  mean  mass  density parameter  Omega  zero,  2)  to  isolate  the  contribution of the cluster environment  to  galaxy  evolution, 3) to determine whether \"E+A\" galaxies, those  strange  objects with strong Balmer absorption lines but no line emission,  are  a  link  in  the chain that connects blue  spirals  to  \"SO\"  galaxies,  and  4)  to uncover the shape of the faint-end  galaxy  luminosity  function in clusters.  Additional  results  from  the  reduction  and interpretation of the data will include  a  better  understanding of the causes of the Butcher-Oemler effect  and  of  the  evolution of the intracluster medium.   The results  of  the  observations  of the three samples will be used  to  unravel  the  detailed  evolutionary history of clusters  and  their  galaxies.  The   results  will  provide  invaluable  baselines  for   future  research,  when  compared  with similarly  extensive  surveys  of  higher redshift systems underway with the new generation of large  ground-based telescopes and NASA satellites .    The  results from the projects will not only yield answers to the  important  questions discussed above, but will also be the  first  and  necessary step in the planning of the most extensive  survey  of  nearby  clusters and their galaxies ever conceived.   Warrick  Couch   (Ang lo-Australian  Observatory  and  Australia   National  University),   Ian  Smail  (Carnegie  Observatories),   and   Ann  Zabludoff (Carnegie Observatories) are planning to use the Anglo-  Australian  Telescope's (AAT) 2DF multi-fiber spectrograph,  with  its   400   fibers,   to   observe  10,000-20,000   galaxies   in  approximately  50 rich clusters in a well defined, volume-limited  sample.  The completion of the 2DF project in the next five years  is  timed to match the completion of other major redshift surveys  of  galaxies  (Las Campanas, Sloan Digital Sky  Survey,  and  AAT  redshift  surveys).   To  understand how all  types  of  galaxies  evolve, large statistical surveys like these, which sample comple  mentary  environments, are needed.  The 2DF cluster  survey  will  sample  the  far tail of the distribution of dense  environments,  regions  which  are strongly dependent on the conditions  in  the  early  universe  and  are  thus powerful  tests  of  cosmological  models.   The  timing of the 2DF project will also coincide  with  promising  new  N-body/hydrodynamic  simulations  of  large-scale  structure  formation (Evrard, Steinmetz, Lake, and others),  with  enough  dynamic range to include tens of clusters  per  universe,  while  maintaining sufficient resolution to monitor the evolution  of  individual galaxies.  For the first time, it will be possible  to  compare  the  details of cluster dynamics and cluster  galaxy  evolution   directly   with   the  predictions   of   theoretical  cosmological models.  ***",
