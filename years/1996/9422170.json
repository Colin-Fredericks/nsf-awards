 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hudson/Abstract           Two research aircraft will be coordinated with the CP-2 dual  wavelength radar, which will direct the aircraft to clouds with  developing coalescence and will provide a time history of cloud  outline and liquid water content.  Detailed cloud droplet and drop  spectra measurements from the two aircraft will trace the  development of coalescence.         The two DRI instantaneous CCN (cloud condensation nuclei)  spectrometers with calibration equipment will be mounted on the  NCAR C-130.  At times these two instruments will redundantly  monitor the ambient aerosol but for most of the time one  spectrometer will monitor the counterflow virtual impactor (CVI) in  order to determine the spectrum of nuclei within cloud droplets.   This will help ascertain the effect of entrainment on the cloud  droplet spectrum and will help differentiate homogeneous,  inhomogeneous, and entity mixing processes.  Comparisons of the CCN  spectra and the spectra of updraft velocities will determine the  influence of the aerosol on droplet spectra.  This basic cloud  forming experiment with comparisons of model predictions of droplet  spectra with observations of droplet spectra will yield a better  definition of CCN--the important critical supersaturations (Sc).         Detailed comparisons of drop (>50 Mm) and droplet (<50 Mm)  spectra will determine the influence of each on the other.  The  fact that these measurements can be made in time sequence before  and after coalescence (before and after the existence of drops)  allows cause and effect to be separated with respect to droplet and  drop spectra.  After coalescence has taken effect the CCN spectra  will be affected.  SCMS will yield the opportunity to follow in  time sequence so that the aerosol can be traced before and after  coalescence scavenging has occurred.",
