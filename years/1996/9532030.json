The specific projects under consideration include the following: (1) determination of the  function from the class of Lipschitz functions with prescribed Lipschitz constant that is  closest to a given function in the sup norm; (2) determination of the relaxation of  multidimensional sup norm functionals; (3) finding the limit, if it exists in any sense, of  homogenized functionals in the sup norm; (4) extending the theory of Young measures  to sup norm functionals; (5) determination of the associated Euler-Aronsson conditions  for variational problems in L-infinity subject to constraints; (6) characterizing the  Lavrentiev phenomenon in L-infinity; (7) analysis of the problem of shape optimization  when the cost involves the sup norm; (8) extending the theory of robust and H-infinity  control to maximum cost functionals. Auxiliary problems in optimal control, differential  games, and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman theory are also part of this investigation.        Many problems in engineering, economics, medicine, and in other fields require  the minimization of some performance criterion subject to various constraints on the  design variables.  In order to simplify the analysis, the most appropriate performance  criterion for a particular application is often replaced by another that is more amenable  to mathematical analysis but is suboptimal for the problem under consideration.  For  example, in the design of the shape of a structural member, the designer may be  primarily interested in minimizing the largest stresses in the member, but in fact may  select design parameters based on minimizing the average of such stresses.  Similarly,  In designing a liftoff plan for a space vehicle, it may be the maximum acceleration and  its attendant forces on the vehicle that should be minimized, not the aver age  acceleration and forces.  In drug or radiation therapy it is the maximum level of the  tumor load that the therapy is attempting to minimize, not the average tumor load.  In  general, replacing a performance criterion based on an average of some density with  one based on the maximum of that density enormously complicates the analysis of the  problem.  This project has the goal of providing the tools, methodology, and theory that  will allow the direct treatment of such problems.  Consequences of the research will be  improved performance in many important applications areas such as those described  above.  ***",
