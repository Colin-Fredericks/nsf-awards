Hysteresis is a widespread phenomenon, studied most   intensively in magnetism, but also found in ferroelectricity, mechanical behavior   including shape memory effects, adsorption, and many other fields.  This workshop will   focus its main attention on magnetic hysteresis, but some seminal work in nonmagnetic   hysteresis will be brought into the discussion by leading practitioners in these areas.    Micromagnetism is a theoretical formulation which permits the prediction of domains and   domain walls, and their movement in changing magnetic fields.  Micromagnetism is   currently in a very high state of world-wide activities.  This workshop is unique in that it   addresses not only the statistical modeling (i.e. hysteresis), but the relationship between    hysteresis and micromagnetism.  ***",
