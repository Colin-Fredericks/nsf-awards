The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a seven-month postdoctoral research  visit which will support Dr. Marty Wolf of Mankato State  University to work with Dr. Brendan McKay at the Australian  National University in Canberra, Australia.        The topic of this research is to establish the complexity of  p-partite tournament isomorphism.  The primary goal is to  determine a tighter analysis of the complexity of this open  problem in graph theory.  There is an interest in studying  this complexity on a variety of combinatorial objects  because it will help develop a deeper understanding of what  makes the isomorphism problem difficult and the relative  complexity of combinatorial objects.  This project is also  significant because some problems found in neural network  algorithms result in networks where the underlying structure  is a p-partite tournament, and Dr. Wolf and Dr. McKay will  explore the application of convex subsets to try and  overcome these problems.  ***",
