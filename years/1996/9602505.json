Paulson at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and  Technology, Tokyo, Japan.  Dr. Paulson will work with Dr.  Noboru Oyama, Professor of Applied Chemistry, on a research  project entitled, \"Redox Control of Conductivity in  'Intelligent' Polymer Systems.\"    The primary goal of the proposed research is to develop a  multi-purpose sensor, for use in aqueous solutions, that can  detect changes in temperature, solvent composition, ionic  strength, and/or pH.  The sensor is based on a N  alkylacrylamide polymer gel modified with an electrically  conducting polymer and works on the principle that changes  in solvent environment will produce volume changes within  the polymer gel.  Since the  conductivity of an electrically conducting polymer is  related to the distance between polymer chains, any volume  changes exhibited by the bulk polymer would be directly  translated into a change in conductivity across the polymer.  Interest in environment responsive polymer gels has  generated proposed applications ranging from temperature  dependent drug delivery systems to light activated memory  devices.  Development of these diverse applications requires  a fundamental understanding of the volume changes exhibited  by polymer gels in response to external stimuli.  The  proposed research is designed to generate data on these  issues, as well as data on how volume changes affect the  electrochemical behavior of modified polymer gels.  *  *  *",
