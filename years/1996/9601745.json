 "awd_abstract_narration": "The term `mother nature` rests on culturally and historically specific notions of both motherhood and nature.  As we reach the end of the twentieth century, scientific and technological developments are influencing the meanings of both.  This ethnographic study focuses on the issue of pregnancy loss in communities exposed to environmental toxins, in order to understand these changes.   Obstetrical textbooks, popular literature and pregnancy support groups commonly portray miscarriages and stillbirths as `acts of nature.`  This view obscures often relevant human impacts in communities and environments that influence these events.  This study focuses on five communities, in New York, Louisiana, and Massachusetts, which have experienced an unusually high rate of pregnancy loss, and where these losses have been attributed to environmental hazards.  The investigator will collect and examine oral, first-person accounts of these losses.  She will examine legal, scientific, social scientific, and journalistic accounts as well.  The stories will then be compared with those produced when pregnancy loss is not attributed to environmental hazards, to explore the ways in which the experience of reproductive loss is changed if the loss is perceived as the result of a humanly-corrupted nature.  Miscarriages and stillbirths are important human experiences to which the special tools and perspectives of anthropology and science and technology studies can contribute greater understanding. The experiences of pregnancy loss and toxic contamination each challenge persons' views of themselves, their communities and environments; the intersection presents an ideal site to investigate usually tacit, taken-for-granted assumptions about motherhood, nature and science and technology, as well as the potentially different perceptions of different socio-economic, ethnic, and racial groups.  The topic offers a valuable perspective to examine the lived experience of environmental crisis and can illuminate issues of equity and gender involved in environmental controversies.  Further, the study will address issues of broad cultural concern, including issues of responsibility and blame, and democratic decision making. Results of this research will be presented at professional meetings and developed into a book aimed at scholars and an educated lay audience.",
