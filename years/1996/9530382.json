 "awd_abstract_narration": "95-30382  Smith    This research project is part of the US Joint Global Ocean  Flux Study (JGOFS) Southern Ocean Program aimed at (1) a  better understanding of the fluxes of carbon, both organic  and inorganic, in the Southern Ocean, (2) identifying the  physical, ecological and biogeochemical factors and  processes which regulate the magnitude and variability of  these fluxes, and (3) placing these fluxes into the context  of the contemporary global carbon cycle.    The overall objectives of JGOFS are to determine and  understand processes controlling the time-varying fluxes of  carbon and associated biogenic elements, and to predict the  response of marine biogeochemical processes to climate  change.  The Southern Ocean is critical in the global carbon  cycle, as judged by its size and the physical processes  which occur in it (e.g., deep and intermediate water  formation), but its present quantitative role is uncertain.    JGOFS objectives for the Southern Ocean study are as  follows:    1)  to constrain the fluxes of carbon (organic and  inorganic) and to place these fluxes in the context of the  contemporary carbon cycle;  2)  to identify the factors and processes which regulate the  magnitude and variability of primary productivity and the  fate of biogenic matter;  3)  to determine the response of the Southern Ocean to  natural climate perturbations; and  4)  to predict the response of the Southern Ocean to climate  change.    In order to successfully address these objectives, a large  field program has been designed to provide various  investigators the opportunity to test specific hypotheses  which relate to these broadly-defined objectives.  We expect  the field test to begin in September 1996, and last through  March 1998 using two ships, the R.V. Palmer, and the R.V.  Thompson.  As most of the investigators will use  hydrographic and nutrient data from these cruises, this  proposal requests funds for the support of the analysis of  nutrient concentrations during these thirteen cruis es.  A  team of oceanographic experts from a variety of institutions  has been assembled to complete these analyses; furthermore,  the data will be scrutinized for errors and provided in a  timely fashion to all PI's in the project, as well as to the  relevant oceanographic data storage facilities.  The  hydrography and coring groups have been put together using  the successful model for the Arabian Sea JGOFS study, and in  conjunction with the nutrient data (supported under a  separate proposal), will form a large portion of the  Southern Ocean JGOFS database which both field investigators  and modelers will use to clarify the role of the Southern  Ocean in the global carbon cycle.",
