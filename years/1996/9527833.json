 "awd_abstract_narration": "9527833  Casper      Under  models  that  predict  long-term  changes  in  global  climate,  semi-desert regions are expected  to  become  even  drier.   The purpose of this study is to predict how natural  populations  of  plants  in these regions  will  respond  to  drought conditions.  Most ecological studies of water use in  plants   have   focused  on  anatomical   or   physiological  adaptations  that  allow particular species  to  occupy  dry  habitats.   There  has been little effort to  determine  how  populations and communities will respond to temporal changes  in  water  availability.  To do this, we need to  understand  how  drought  affects individuals depending on  their  size,  developmental stage, or associations with other plants.  The  investigators  will  experimentally  reduce  the  amount  of  rainfall  received by natural populations of the semi-desert  herbaceous perennial Cryptantha flava by erecting  temporary  shelters  during spring rainstorms.  The study is  based  on  data collected during a natural drought year indicating that  larger  plants  are more severely affected by  drought  than  smaller  plants.   Comparisions will be  made  of  survival,  growth  and flowering of individuals of different sizes  and  in  different  microhabitats, under shrubs or in  the  open,  both  in  areas where water has been reduced  and  in  areas  receiving natural rainfall.  These demographic data will  be  supplemented  by  measurements of water use,  leaf  nitrogen  content,  and  photosynthesis.  These sorts of  measurements  will help to determine why individuals respond to changes in  water  availability as they do.  The experimental  reduction  in  water  will  be repeated spatially and in two  different  years.   Demographic and physiological measurements will  be  taken  on  the same individuals in the year before  drought,  the drought year, and the year afterwards.  This replication  of  the experiment is important because natural variation in  rainfall  is  likely  to  occur during the  experiment.   The  study  should  also  lead  to  identification  of  lingering  effects that extend beyond the drought year itself.",
