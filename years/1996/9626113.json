 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS9626113  Chen  This research is concerned with nonparametric model building  procedures and nonparametric prediction methods in nonlinear time  series analysis.  The first objective of  this research is to  develop a new nonparametric modeling procedure for nonlinear time  series.  The investigator studies the functional coefficient  autoregressive models and makes the model easier to use in  practice.  In particular, a weighted local linear regression  procedure is studied.  This procedure differs from the classical  local linear regression for curve fitting  where the response  function is of interest.  Here, estimating the coefficient  functions are of main interest.  A procedure for detecting  discontinuities in the coefficient functions is studied as well.  The second objective of this research is concerned with   multi-step predictions using nonparametric smoothing techniques.  The investigator studies the properties of a multi-stage  nonparametric predictor, which is closely related to the  iterative integration procedures for multi-step prediction.  Preliminary study shows that the new method does improve the  accuracy of the prediction.  The first goal is to show that the  predictor is applicable to a wide class of nonlinear AR models.  The second goal is to investigate the practical implementation of  the method, particularly the automatic bandwidth selection method  and prediction strategy.  This research is concerned with model building procedures and  prediction methods in nonlinear time series analysis.  A time  series is a set of data observed over a period of time.  For  example, daily ozone and pollutant readings for environmental  study, quarterly unemployment rate or GNP for economical study  and noisy telecommunication signals are all subjects of time  series analysis.  Time series analysis tries to reveal the   generating mechanism of the observed time series and to provide  sensible methods to predict future observations based on current  and past information.  Linear ti me series models assumes the  future observations relate to the current and past observations  in simple linear functions while nonlinear models assume complex  relationship.  In this research, the investigator follows the  principle of `letting the data speak for themselves' and develops  modeling procedures for nonlinear time series.  It is used to  overcome the difficulty encountered in real applications of  choosing an appropriate model.  The second objective of this  research is concerned with multi-step predictions for nonlinear  time series. Nonlinear time series models have been shown to have  certain advantages in multi-step forecasting over linear models.  In this research, the investigator studies the properties of a  new predictor that improves the prediction accuracy.  There are  sufficient reasons to believe that the results of this research  should have significant contributions in nonlinear time series  analysis, which has many important applications in the fields of  economics, telecommunication, meteorology, environment and many  others.",
