 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in high-quality video frame-grabber technology, charge-coupled-device (CCD) video cameras, and desktop computing have made image processing available in fields as diverse as medical research and video entertainment. Many experiments in introductory physics for both the science major and nonmajor use older equipment and methods and suffer from a `cookbook` approach. Experiments such as these fail to involve students in a meaningful way. They are boring and do not teach students the important skill of experimental design.   This project applies digital video capture technology using Macintosh computers to kinematic experiments in introductory physics. The video technology and image processing software used in this project enables students in introductory physics laboratories to easily visualize and quickly measure an object's displacement and to calculate its velocity, acceleration, and the force acting on it. Students use this equipment to explore free-fall, friction, conservation of momentum, and other phenomena. Portable CCD cameras enable students to carry out experiments outside the laboratory environment. Since experiments and data analysis can be carried out rapidly, students can exercise their creativity by trying their own variations on an experiment rather than just following the `cookbook` approach often found in the introductory laboratory. Students need to have laboratory experiences that encourage their creativity, help them explore open-ended problems, and teach them to design experiments. Laboratory experiments that students can perform with this equipment can help them develop their physical understanding of and maintain enthusiasm for the discipline.",
