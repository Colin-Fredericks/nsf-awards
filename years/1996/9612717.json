 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612717  Bidwell    This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement study examines the conditions under which students oppose efforts to educate them.  Traditional views often characterize resistance as something intrinsic to the adolescent world.  In contrast, this research takes the view that resistance is not necessarily intrinsic to the adolescent world but is in great part determined by the organization of learning in the classroom and the curriculum.  This study focuses on the multiple relational structures of three separate high schools at the school and classroom levels.  At the school level, the distinct but interdependent relational structures (i.e., course curriculum, extra-curricular activities, and student friendships) will be investigated while at the classroom level micro-relations that persist within individual settings will be examined.  Month-long visits will be conducted in 10th, 11th and 12th grade classes in three high schools (located in Kansas City, Kansas, Grand Rapids, Michigan and Brookline, Massachusetts) to administer surveys to students on classroom friendships, perceptions of teaching style, relationship with teacher and course subject-matter.  Survey data will be supplemented with observational data.  These data will be analyzed to identify the dimension and level at which the organization of student relations is most likely to lead students to resist educational efforts.   ***  ??",
