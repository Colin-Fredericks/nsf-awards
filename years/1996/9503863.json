 "awd_abstract_narration": "Requirements completeness is the extent to which an  application meets user needs. Many applications fail to meet  user needs because their requirements incompletely specify  what should happen in non-normative situations. Such  applications constrain users' actions, so that \"workarounds\"  must be invented.    This project is to develop and evaluate novel methods for  improving and predicting the completeness of requirements  with an emphasis on interactive applications for individual  users and small groups. It is assumed that requirements can  be derived from user and enterprise goals, and so  completeness is defined as the fit between a feature set and  the goals and goal-thwarting obstacles that arise in the use  context. There are two research challenges: (i) development  of methods for analyzing the use of context to uncover goals  and obstacles, and (ii) development of methods for deriving  requirements from goals and obstacles. Approaches are to be  developed for performing these transformations: identifying  goals, decomposing goals into subgoals,clarifying goal  dependencies, transforming goals into operations,  establishing the boundary between application and  environment, allocating operations to application and users,  identifying obstacles, inventing scenarios for analysis of  obstacles, and adding operations or goals to deal with  obstacles. The project also seeks to extend and specialize  for goal refinement the Inquiry-Based Requirements Analysis  process (in which requirements derivation intertwines the  expression of models, discussion of their content, and  transformation). Work in design rationale is applicable to  guiding recurring patterns of goal refinement.    Candidate feature sets can be compared by exploring  scenarios that are derived systematically from the goal  structure: Scenarios are generated using a story grammar,  with each significant episode representing a goal or an  obstacle. Scenario generation heuristics lead to greater  goal/obstacle coverage, and  therefore greater requirements  completeness without unnecessary redundancy.    Development and evaluation of the goal refinement strategy  are proceeding simultaneously. The number and quality of  additional requirements that are identified as a result of  applying the strategy to realistic case studies will be  measured. Industrial case studies are carried out in  parallel with industrial funding.  ***",
