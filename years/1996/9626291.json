 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626291  Chaikin  A series of experiments are proposed to understand some of the  basic properties of states of matter in organic conductors, and  to gain insights into several current problems in condensed  matter physics.  For example, the Bechgaard salts are the only  materials which exhibit the quantum Hall effect as a bulk three  dimensional phenomenon.  They are therefore unique systems for  studying what happens when the conventional two dimensional  electron gas layers are coupled.  Questions as to the  perpendicular conductivity and the coupling of edge states are  open and testable.  As superconductors these systems are at least  as anisotropic as any others and they have much longer mean free  paths.  They are excellent candidates for investigating flux  pinning, dynamics and Josephson vortices.  Investigation also are  proposed on the nature of the superconducting state. The magnetic  field effects in both the\"normal\" metal and field induced spin  density wave states have proven so unusual that there are a  wealth of new phenomena to be explained.  Coupled with the fact  that questions of commensurability, magnetic breakdown, competing  order parameters and frustration leave the limiting high field  ground state an open question theoretically as well as  experimentally, there is much to fuel continued excitement in  this field.  %%%  This proposal is for continuation of a mostly experimental study  of how low-dimensional strong interactions and frustration from  applied fields act together to produce some quite interesting  states of matter in organic conductors.  The Bechgaard salts are  among the most interesting electronic materials ever discovered.  At room temperature they are highly anisotropic metals, but upon  cooling they undergo a variety of transitions to a remarkable  number of low temperature states.  They were the first organic  superconductors, but that is arguably their least interesting  property.  Depending on the anion and the pressure the ground  states may be var ied from charge or spin density wave insulator  to metal or superconductor.  However, the properties discovered  in moderate magnetic fields are even more unusual and striking.  The normal metal phase also is extremely unusual showing angular  dependent resonances and large magnetoresistances completely  unexplainable from the known bandstructure.",
