 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Peter Wolczanski of Cornell University proposes to investigate the   chemistry of low-coordinate inorganic/organometallic complexes supported   by bulky siloxide, silamide, silimide, thiolate, and acetylide ligands.    In particular, the small molecule activation chemistry of these systems   will be explored, and a new class of metal-organic solid state materials   will be developed, with an emphasis on comprehensive training of the   graduate students involved.  A major goal is to generate a greater   understanding of the thermodynamic aspects of C-H bond activiation by   `tying` C-H bond activations to energetically similar ligand   substitutions, and by measuring equilibrium isotope effects and comparing   them to theory.  Also, C-N bond cleavage reactions will be explored,   especially as they relate to HydroDeNitrogenation processes.  Mechanistic   studies and systemization of oxidative addition processes of these   systems is a general research goal, and studies of early transition   metallaradical based C-H bond activation chemistry and metal organic   solid-state compounds with covalent networks are included.  The chemistry of a class of unique inorganic complexes with bonds to   nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and carbon substituents will be studied for two   reasons.  One is that these compounds display unusual and unique   reactivity with C-H and C-N bonds in other molecules, and have   implications for improving industrial processes.  The other is that they   can be used as molecular precursors in the synthesis of novel materials   of high complexity.  These studies place experimental studies in a   theoretical framework, and it is hoped that the fundamental chemistry   discovered will lead to improved methods of controlling the reactivity of   hydrocarbons and of designing interesting materials.",
