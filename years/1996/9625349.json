 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. James Espenson and Dr. Andreja Bakac of the Department of Chemistry,   Iowa State University, are supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division for studies to develop a   molecular level understanding of oxygen atom transfer. They will probe   the mechanisms of oxygen atom transfer reactions of transition metal   oxygen and oxo complexes. The studies include the use of the complex,   methylrhenium dioxide (MDO), as a prototype oxygen atom acceptor, and   inorganic oxyanions and transition metal oxo complexes as oxygen donors.    Kinetic and thermodynamic determinations will be carried out to construct   a scale of oxygen atom transfer reactivities on the basis of the Marcus   equation. The effects of hydrogen bonding on the stability of   superoxometal complexes will be studied using deuterium isotope effects,   and the chemistry of superoxo and oxo ions of biologically relevant   chromium complexes will be investigated.  Chemical reactions in which oxygen atoms are transferred from one metal   to another or from metals to non-metals are fundamental to many   biological and industrial processes.  However, advances in this area are   currently hindered by the lack of a fundamental understanding of these   processes.  In this project, Espenson and Bakac will determine the rates   and pathways by which oxygen is exchanged between various atoms, and they   will relate these studies to the current theory which describes electron   transfer reactions.  They will explore oxygen transfer systems with   industrial and biological relevance.",
