 "awd_abstract_narration": "A one week workshop on introductory FT-NMR is being held for twelve  faculty members. These faculty come from two and four year  institutions in a seven state region including Arkansas, Oklahoma,  Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Illinois, and Iowa.  Special efforts  are being made to recruit women and minority participants.  The  workshop consists of lectures, instrument use, and data analysis.   Topics covered range from introductory NMR theory to pulse  sequences and 2-D NMR.  Participants use a JOEL 270 MHZ FT-NMR,  purchased with NSF-ILI support, to obtain proton, carbon-13,  phosphorous-31, DEPT, COSY, HETCOR, and other spectra.  Each  participant receives a handbook containing theory, spectra, and  specific NMR applications suitable for use in undergraduate  laboratories. The participants gain an expanded knowledge of modern  NMR techniques and are encouraged to introduce these techniques  into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum.  A follow-up meeting  will be held at the midwest Regional ACS meeting, November 1996.   Participants reports on the use of information from this workshop  at their institutions will be collected, edited, published and  distributed to all institutions of higher education in the seven  state region.",
