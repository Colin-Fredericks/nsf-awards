 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this application we describe research programs in  structural biology at two different institutions, each of  which requires the ability to  analyze data obtained from our high resolution electron  microscopes. In order to be able to fully utilize the  capabilities of our EM Facilities and to overcome a major  gap in the technological resources available to the life  sciences communities at Brandeis University and at Boston  University School of Medicine, we are proposing to purchase  a high resolution precision microdensitometer scanning  system.      Considerable effort has been devoted to insure that   the Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center (the     Center) and BUSM, Department of Biophysics have the EM    facilities necessary to pursue high-resolution structural     studies. Over the past few years several projects have          developed specimens extremely well suited for       Cystallographic and single particle study using EM   techniques. Optical diffraction of film recorded EM images       and/or direct observation of film recorded electron    diffraction patterns of a variety of these specimens have   indicated that the information content of much of this data    is great and that Programs for high-resolution structural                   determination are feasible.                                  Central to working with any film recorded data  is the ability to convert this information into digital form     for computer-based processing and analysis. In neither   institution is there currently a device able to digitize EM    film recorded data in a form suitable for high-resolution    structural studies. (The digitization equipment currently      available is inadequate even for moderate resolution   studies.) The few EM based high-resolution reconstructions    performed on biological samples (bacteriorhodopsin, light                           harvesting  complex and porin) in other laboratories were exclusively           determined with data (images and diffraction            patterns) digitized through precision           microdensitometers. Both the Center's high  resolution electron microscopes (Philips CM12 and          Model 420) are routinely providing high  resolution images for our structural biology research           programs. However, in order to digitize these  images for computer analysis it has been           necessary for our investigators to travel to  Albany, NY as there are no suitable scanners in New           England. The instrument of choice for this  application is currently being manufactured by           Orbital Sciences Corporation (Pomona, CA). It  is a flat-bed microdensitometer and is essentially           identical to the Perkin-Elmer instrument which  is no longer manufactured. It is widely regarded           as the state-of-the-art instrument for image  digitization and far exceeds the capabilities of our           current scanner. The technique used in the           Orbital  microdensitometer system is almost           completely free of optical aberrations and  produces high fidelity data. The major advantage of           this instrument is that an illuminated area of  the specimen is optically projected onto a sample           defining aperture as small as 3~m. Only that  light which passes through the aperture is measured         and digitized. Scanning is accomplished by  laterally translating the specimen relative to the         optical axis. The aperture maintains a fixed  location on the optical axis, thereby minimizing           distortions and the effects of optical           aberrations.  The Center's only available instrument is an           Eikonix digitizer which operates by projecting  a real image of the specimen to be digitized using        a 35mm photographic lens. This real image is  digitized via a linear photodiode array which is           translated across the image plane. This           approach,  though relatively inexpensive, is subject to a           multitude of optical and mechanical defects.  The  Eikonix scanner cannot support our high           resolution structural studies reliably.",
