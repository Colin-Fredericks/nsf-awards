 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  proposal  will fund the initial development,  testing,  and  distribution of ecological simulation software (EcoSim).  In  the  study  of  ecology  and evolution, simulations are  an  important  analytical  tool.  They allow an investigator to  ask  \"what  if\"  questions, and to test patterns against stochastic models.  \"Null  models\" are simulations that deliberately exclude a mechanism  of  interest, and provide benchmark tests for patterns in nature.    In  spite of their popularity, null models require a good deal of  computer   expertise   to  construct.  Many  biologists   without  programming skills have been unable to use null models  in  their  work..  For biologists who are also computer programmers,  it  is  still very time-consuming to build, test, and de-bug null models.    EcoSim is a set of stand-alone software modules that will satisfy  the  needs  of  biologists  for  null  models.   EcoSim  will  be  developed specifically for personal computers, and will initially  be  written  for the Windows 95 operating system.  Data  will  be  easily  imported and exported, providing full compatibility  with  other   graphics  and  statistics  software.   Pull-down   menus,  checkboxes,  and a powerful data editor will allow  the  user  to  select  a  variety of simulation options, including power  tests.  Output  will  be  fully documented with on-screen  graphics.  The  modules  and  the  interface  will be  programmed  in  Delphi,  a  powerful new programming language.    The  primary audience for EcoSim will be community ecologists and  biogeographers.  However, the modules will be widely used by many  kinds    of    biologists.   College   laboratory    instructors,  demographers,   review  authors,  paleontologists,   conservation  biologists,  environmental consultants, fisheries biologists  and  many  others will find useful tests in EcoSim.  The modules  will  provide  analytical tools applicable to both  basic  and  applied  ecology.    EcoSim  will  be  thoroughly doc umented  and  tested  before  its  release  to the scientific community.  EcoSim will be distributed  free-of-charge  through  Internet and  a  World  Wide  Web  site.  EcoSim will be a standalone program that includes on-line help, a  user's manual, sample data sets and advice on using null models.    Funding from a SGER will allow us to build the user interface and  two  modules:  (1) species diversity and (2) niche overlap. These  models  are  likely to used by the greatest number of  ecologists  and  educators.  Future implementations of  EcoSim  will  include  modules  for  (3)  body  size  ratios,  (4)  co-occurrence,   (5)  incidence  functions, (6) species-area relationships,  (7)  range  overlap, (8) shared species, and (9) cluster formation.  A  tenth  module  will  allow the user to construct customized  null  model  tests with a minimum of programming.  This tenth user-module will  greatly  expand the utility of EcoSim for problems in  population  genetics, demography, and behavior.    EcoSim  has  the potential to affect a large number of ecologists  by  providing them with analytic tools.  A similar problem in the  history  of  cladistic  analysis  points  to  the  importance  of  software  availability on the development and  infrastructure  of  science.",
