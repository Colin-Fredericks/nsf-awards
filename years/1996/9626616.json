Recently, attention has  turned to the so-called \"Fundamental lemma,\" which appears to be the  single most difficult unproven conjecture in the field, and which  threatens to delay indefinitely the completion of the program.  Nevertheless, the lemma is so widely believed to be true that papers  are regularly published that depend on its validity.  In the simplest  cases, the fundamental lemma is a conjectural equality between an  orbital integral on a p-adic algebraic group, and another orbital  integral on an endoscopic group.  It is an amazing formula, which has  been verified (with great difficulty) in a number of special cases.  Professors Goresky, Kottwitz, and MacPherson have found a new approach  to this problem that adds a number of geometric ideas and methods;  by a sequence of reductions, applications of the Weil conjectures and  the Lefschetz fixed point formula, each case of the fundamental lemma  may be restated as an equality between the equivariant cohomology  groups of two naturally occurring complex projective algebraic  varieties.  These two varieties apparently have little or nothing to  do with each other except that they both admit an action by the same  torus.  Using their newly developed formula for equivariant  cohomology, Professors Goresky, Kottwitz, and MacPherson have found it  possible to compare both sides of the fundamental lemma, which in many  cases suffices for a proof.  They are refining this technique with the  hopes that it may eventually lead to a complete proof.       To put the foregoing in perspective, during the 1970's, R. Langlands  (of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton) outlined a series  of conjectures and ideas of enormous scope and depth that, when fully  explored and verified, will result in a \"grand unification\" of several  branches of mathematics, including number theory, representation  theory of  Lie groups, and harmonic analysis.  During the last twenty  years enormous progress has been made on this program, and very  difficult obstacles have been overcome.  Nevertheless, it is commonly  believed that it may take another twenty years (or more) before  Langlands' ideas are fully explored.  The \"fundamental lemma\" remains  the single most outstanding difficulty in the program.  It has been  proven in many special cases, and, as mentioned above, it is so widely  believed to be true that papers which depend on it are regularly  published in refereed journals.  Professors Goresky, Kottwitz and  MacPherson have discovered new geometric techniques in the study of  the fundamental lemma that will lead to its proof in many new cases  and may eventually lead to a complete proof.  Although these geometric  techniques have been developed primarily to carry out this step in  Langlands' program, they have already been applied to problems in  other areas of mathematics.  ***",
