 "awd_abstract_narration": "9529946  Chmurny   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is designed to establish the commercial feasibility for use of a novel marine microbial polysaccharide in the removal of heavy metals from industrial effluents and environmental media including potable water.  These metal pollutants are among the most prevalent and problematic waste treatment and environmental remediation targets.  Current technologies provide only partially effective treatment and are costly to implement and use.  It is proposed that this complex polysaccharide cell matrix designated MHS-3, which was shown in Phase I work to have exceptional affinity for heavy metals including lead and mercury, be developed into an integrated metals removal system.  Cell mass fabricated into a number of resin-like matrices will be evaluated for its ability to adsorb heavy metals from complex waste streams containing non-hazardous metals and organic materials under anticipated field conditions.  The objectives of this Phase II project are to: 1) establish conditions for the cost-effective production of MHS-3 cell mass; 2) characterize the performance of MHS-3 bioadsorbents against a full panel of regulated and nonregulated metals; 3) characterize bioadsorbent performance in at least two treatment system configurations; 4) evaluate prototype bioadsorbents in the treatment of model and real-world streams 5) establish procedures for the cost-effective preparation of selected bioadsorbent(s); and 6) carry out bench scale, large laboratory-scale and small pilot-scale demonstrations with prototype adsorbent treatment systems.  It is anticipated that this work will document that these adsorbent systems offer superior treatment economics for many wastes and are an enabling technology for the treatment of others, including the removal of trace metals from drinking water.    This research will form the basis of lower cost, more efficient, and lower energy- demanding methods for removing heavy metals from metal finishing plants, la ndfill leachates, contaminated aquifers and, potentially, radioactive materials storage sites in the U.S. and world-wide.  Initial commercialization of this technology will target applications with low volume, well defined, highly similar wastes, modest equipment and capital requirements for the treatment system, low projected operating costs and ease of market entry.  Such applications include printed wiring board manufacturing sites and lead-acid battery reprocessing facilities.  Sales of materials and systems in these areas are expected within three years and should provide Phase III program revenue to fund significant portions of the longer term development targets in high volume applications such as potable water treatment and refinery effluent clean-up.",
