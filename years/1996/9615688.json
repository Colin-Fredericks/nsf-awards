 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615688  Raviv       Supports initial exploration of an analog VLSI design for a  novel, reduced-complexity task specific visual retina.  The  proposed retina generates specific quantitative information  about imminent threat of collision in real time, which can be  used as a powerful sensory feedback signal in closed-loop  control for autonomous navigation (e.g., collision avoidance) as  well as other tasks.  When dealing with a moving camera-based  autonomous navigation system, a huge amount of rapidly varying  visual data is captured. Processing all these data in real time  is a difficult task. There is a need to reduce the rapidly  varying video-rate images to a few signals that are relevant to  the tasks at hand.  The PI's ongoing research has resulted in  identification of several relevant visual motion cues, one of  which is the Visual Threat Cue (VTC). This cue can be viewed as  a mechanism to reduce the vast rapidly changing visual data to  one slowly-changing signal.  The proposed retina extracts the  VTC in a singlestage parallel operation.  It employs raw gray  level data directly to extract the VTC, i.e., without the need  for pre processing such as edge detection, segmentation, feature  tracking, optical flow, etc.  Potential applications include  realtime autonomous navigation, aid to visually-impaired people,  behavior-based robotics, and multi-eye agents.",
