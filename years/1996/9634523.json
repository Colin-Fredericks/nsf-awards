Both future priorities for research and  education, as well as areas that are already well-served by the EDA industry and  are unlikely to require major new methodological or technological breakthroughs  are considered.  The workshop report includes: (1) a statement of the most  pressing problems to solve within the next decade, (2) recommendations regarding  the style and kind of research to be conducted and suggestions to the community  as to how to implement these suggestions, and (3) viewpoints on increasing the  impact of the EDA field on education in electrical and computer engineering.",
