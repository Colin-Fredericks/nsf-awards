 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514821  TAYLOR    Recent research has shown that young children absorb the  information they are taught without realizing that they are  learning something new.  For  example, once 4- and 5-year-olds  learn a novel fact such as the function of litmus paper, they  claim to have known the new information for a long time.  They  also have difficulty identifying which information they have  known longer, a fact the experimenter taught them a minute  earlier (e.g., the name of the color chartreuse) or a fact they  have known for a long time (e.g., the name of the color green).   Across a variety of tasks, young children fail to attend to  transitions in their own knowledge and claim they  have always  known what they have just learned.  The evidence indicates that  these results are due to a genuine conceptual difficulty, rather  than a desire to appear knowledgeable to the experimenter or some  other superficial aspect of the task.  This research will provide  an in depth investigation of cognitive explanations for this  phenomenon.  Children's failure to report learning something new  seems related to the way they understand the mind and their  concept of what it means to have knowledge.  The experiments will  test the hypothesis that children's developing knowledge about  the mind affects the way they encode learning events and retrieve  new information in memory.  In  addition, this work will explore  the factors affecting children's ability to  notice the  acquisition of new information.  The findings of this research  will provide new information about the development of children's  concept of knowledge, the extent that children's understanding of  mental life influences the way they encode everyday events  involving learning, and the conditions that help preschool  children become more aware of changes in their own knowledge.   This work will potentially have educational implications because  development in children's understanding of knowledge influences  the effectiveness of different metho ds of instruction and  children's motivation to engage in learning activities.    ***",
