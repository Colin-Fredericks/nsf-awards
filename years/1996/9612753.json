These meetings focused on the difficulties associated with building good tools, and the lack of infrastructure for tool development and test. This proposal is for a workshop to discuss design and implementation solutions to the lack of these software tools for high performance computing systems.  The discussions will focus will focus primarily on issues of debugging, performance measurement, analysis, and presentation as they relate to these needs.  By including academic researchers, vendors, and government agency representatives, a wide variety of opinions, viewpoints, and needs can be presented and explored to the mutual benefit of all the groups.",
