Participants at this conference are recent Ph.D. recipients and  doctoral students who are within a year of completion of their  degrees.  This is the only conference in North America  exclusively for new researchers in Statistics and Probability.  The first two conferences, held in August 1993 and July 1995,  were very successful and had close to fifty participants each.   The conference, planned by the New Researchers' Committee of the   Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS), will also be listed  as one of the special pre-meeting conferences at the 1997 annual  meeting of the IMS.    The objective of the conference is to bring together, in the  early years of their careers, researchers from diverse areas of   Statistics and Probability.  Research areas include  computationally intensive statistical methods, Bayesian and   non-Bayesian inference, applied probability and stochastic  process, as well as areas with an emphasis on application of  statistical methods such as biostatistics, environmental   statistics, and engineering.  The conference is limited to  50  participants, and lasts for 3 days during which each participant  is required to present her/his research in the form of a short  talk or in a poster. Such active participation is important for  researchers in beginning stages of their careers because it  facilitates an exchange of research ideas.  The program also  includes three overview talks by senior researchers on  cutting-edge research  in Statistics and Probability as well as a  panel discussion on how to initiate a research program.  The  conference will be held before the annual meetings of the  Institute of Mathematical Sciences so that participants can then  attend those meetings.",
