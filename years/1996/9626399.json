 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626399  Shayman    Discrete systems are systems that involve quantities which take  on a discrete set of values and which are constant except at  discrete times when events occur in the system.  Examples include  communication networks, intelligent vehicle highway systems,  manufacturing systems and computer programs.  Supervisory control  theory was developed to provide a mathematical framework for the  design of controllers for such systems in order to meet various  constraints.  The majority of the research effort in this area  has focused on the supervisory control of deterministic systems.   However, unmodeled dynamics or partial observation often leads to  {\\it nondeterministic models} in which knowledge of the current  state and next event is insufficient to uniquely determine the  next state.  Distributed systems commonly have nondeterministic  models.  The research program described in this proposal is  intended to extend supervisory control theory so that it can  accommodate technical issues that arise in the automation of  fault management for communication networks. These include, among  others, the effects of a distributed plant on the information  available to the supervisor as well as tradeoffs between the  effectiveness of control and the cost of information. The latter  is especially important for network management since the  information gathering process of monitoring the network elements  diverts network resources from the primary task of data transfer.  ***",
