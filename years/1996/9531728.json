 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sisk  9602169    Puberty is a well-defined developmental phase when reproductive  function and behaviors mature in animal species.  The maturation  process begins in a poorly defined manner and is propagated further  by changes in gonadal steroid sensitivity.  Unfortunately, a  thorough understanding of the mechanisms triggering puberty has  been elusive.  Dr. Sisk's investigations focus on how androgenic  steroid hormones, such as testosterone, influence brain function  differently in reproductively immature and adult males.  Juvenile  males are relatively unresponsive to the effects of testosterone on  behaviors related to reproduction, and Dr. Sisk is identifying the  neuronal elements of prepubertal males responsible for the lack of  responsivity and the underlying causes.  In addition, the idea of  puberty as a developmental stage during which steroid hormones can  permanently shape brain organization and function are being  addressed.  These investigations will provide important  contributions to an understanding of how brain processes change  during puberty, and will also have more general applicability to an  understanding of hormonal influences on the nervous system  throughout the lifespan.  These investigations contribute  significantly to our understanding of species survival in the  natural setting and the neurobiological basis for successful  reproduction.",
