 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626754  BARBER         Duke University will not operate the R/V CAPE HATTERAS in  1996.  The vessel will be in lay-up status.  The HATTERAS is a 135'  general purpose research vessel constructed in 1981.  The ship is  owned by the National Science Foundation and operated by Duke  University.  The vessel had a very light scheduled for 1996.  For  greater efficiency of the fleet the few days that were scheduled on  Hatteras were switched to other vessels.  The Hatteras is now at  mid-life and is due for a mid-life upgrade.  During the lay-up  period the operator will start the engineering and mid-life refit.        The HATTERAS is part of a fleet of ships used by the National  Science Foundation in support of marine science research.  Most  oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment be  permanently installed on the vessel, thus the necessity for  specialized ships.  These vessels do not operate in the same mode  as general cargo/fishing vessels.  As a result, NSF supports the  operation of a variety of ships specifically dedicated to  oceanographic research that are operated by universities and  institutions around the country.",
