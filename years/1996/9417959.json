Mahrt/Abstract  ATM-9417959           The surface radiative temperature is the only available  surface temperature in most large scale field programs and is  therefore used to estimate the vertical temperature difference in  the bulk aerodynamic relationship.  In many numerical models, the  vertical temperature difference is estimated in terms of  radiative  surface temperature computed from the surface energy balance.  Both  of these applications generally retain existing similarity theory  even though such similarity theory is appropriate only for the  temperature at the roughness height.  Several recent studies have  shown that the combination of surface radiative temperature with  existing similarity theory can lead to large errors, counter  gradient fluxes and/or absurdly small values of the roughness  height for heat.  This document research proposes to ameliorate  these problems by considering modification of existing similarity  theory and relationships between the surface radiation temperature  and the aerodynamic surface temperature.  These developments must  be preceded by replacing the value of the surface radiative  temperature with a function of the microscale distribution of the  surface radiative temperature.  As one example, appropriate  weighting of the temperature of hot dry ground, partially covered  by transpiring vegetation, should eliminate cases of  countergradient heat transport.  Several models and measurement  schemes or representing the microscale distribution of surface  radiation temperature are proposed.         The data analysis will take advantage of existing tower and  aircraft observations from a number of field programs.  In  addition, more focused measurements of the microscale distribution  of surface radiative temperature will be implemented along with  flux measurements from the NCAR ASTER System.  The bulk aerodynamic  formulation will be re-evaluated in terms of the improved  representation of the surface radiation temperature.  Special   attention will be given to problems associated with the free  convection case of nearly vanishing mean flow and the case of  spatially- averaged fluxes under weak wind conditions.",
