The equipment will be used for several research projects, including in particular:       *AI-based planning for manufacturing,    *High Performance Support for Large Knowledge Bases,     *Combination of generative and case-based reuse techniques in AI      planning, and     *Low-cost robotics.      In addition, a CAD tool will be donated by Bentley Systems Inc. to facilitate experimentation with the AI planning techniques in the manufacturing domain.",
