 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on a new and innovative approach for formation evaluation at the drill bit. Radioactive Measurement-While-Drilling (MWD) tools are currently in use for measuring formation density and neutron porosity. However, these have limited capabilities and involve safety and environmental risks. A project is proposed with the objective of developing an electrical Neutron/X-ray (N/X) tool which will replace both of the existing radioactive tools. This novel instrument is expected to offer: (1) improved measurement capabilities; (2) lower costs and (3) greatly reduced safety and environmental hazards. The objective of Phase I is to demonstrate proof-of-principle for the N/X MWD tool concept by: (1) designing and assembling an N/X source experiment; (2) operating the experiment to demonstrate high neutron output; (3) developing the conceptual design for an N/X tool integrated into a 17 cm (6.75 inch) drill collar and (4) performing computer modeling studies to assess and maximize tool performance.        A leading MWD company will participate in the Phase I project, thereby initiating the commercialization process. Success in Phase I will form a firm foundation for demonstration of a laboratory prototype N/X logging system in Phase II.  This project will provide an advanced non-radioactive MWD logging tool with numerous advantages relative to existing tools. It will provide for measurement of: (1) density and lithology; (2) thermal neutron capture cross section; (3) neutron porosity through temporal and spatial measurements of the epithermal neutron population; and (4) neutron induced spectral gamma-rays. This will be valuable for safe and economical development of oil and gas wells, and for research.",
