 "awd_abstract_narration": "9525766  Tyson       Traveling waves of excitation provide a mechanism for  communication and spatial organization in a variety of biological  systems, such as waves of membrane depolarization in  neuromuscular tissue, waves of mitosis in fruit fly embryos,  waves of cyclic AMP during slime mold aggregation, and waves of  infection spreading through susceptible populations.  These and  other examples of excitability share many common features that  can be expressed in generic mathematical models of excitable  media.  The investigator and his colleague study wave propagation  in such models using established theoretical tools and new  computational approaches, focusing primarily on rotating scroll  waves in three-dimensional excitable media.  As a scroll waves  rotates around its central \"filament,\" the filament moves slowly  through space according to certain laws of motion that are still  poorly understood.  The investigators develop efficient and  accurate computational tools, based on a cellular automaton model  of excitable media, in order to simulate the motion of scroll  filaments in large domains over long periods of time.       The thick-walled ventricle of the mammalian heart is a  three-dimensional excitable medium that propagates waves of  electrochemical activity.  By modulating intracellular calcium  levels, these waves control the beating of the heart.  During a  normal heartbeat the wave induces the muscle fibers of the left  ventricle to contract synchronously and blood is efficiently  expelled from the chamber.  But under pathological conditions  (flutter and fibrillation), the heartbeat degenerates into a  rotating scroll wave of the sort studied in this project.  The  rotating scroll wave causes the muscle fibers to contract  asynchronously, so that part of the chamber is relaxed when other  parts are contracting.  As a result the blood within the chamber  is not pumped efficiently and the heart must be \"defibrillated\"  to save the victim's life.  To understand the fundamental  causes  of ventricular fibrillation and its effective treatment, one  needs a better understanding of the onset, development and  annihilation of rotating scroll waves in three-dimensional  excitable media, which is the basic goal of this project.",
