 "awd_abstract_narration": "95-30619  DePoy    Dr. DePoy and his Co-Principal Investigator, Dr. Andrew P.  Gould, will carry  out a 3-year search for extra-solar planets.  The search  will be based on a  multi-color microlensing detection technique (see below).  The instrument to  be used is the Ohio State Infrared Imager and Spectrometer,  which was built  with previous NSF grants (AST 90-16112 to J. A. Frogel and  AST 92-18449 to  Dr. D. L. DePoy).  Observations will be carried out at the  Cerro Tololo  Inter-American (CTIO) Observatory 1-meter telescope.    \"Microlensing\" refers to the magnification of a background  star when it is  occulted (or nearly occulted) by a less distant star.  For  solar-mass stars,  microlensing light curves have time scales of about two  months.  If the  nearby star has planets, their presence can be inferred by  searching for  deviations from the standard microlensing light curve.  Such  deviations are  expected to reveal themselves in less than a day.  Microlensing searches  require nightly photometry of millions of stars and  sophisticated data  processing.    The investigators will rely on notification from teams that  are already  carrying out microlensing surveys in the attempt to detect  dark matter in  the universe.  Dr. Depoy and his coworkers have close ties  to three such  microlensing/dark matter teams.  Once a target has been  identified, the  investigators will monitor it and look for deviations from  the standard  microlensing light curve.  Simultaneously, they will take  images of the  target in two widely spaced wavelengths. This additional  imaging information  will allow them to constrain the masses of both the star and  planet, and to  determine their physical separation.  They estimate that  they may be able to  detect 10-20 Jupiter-mass planets during two years of  monitoring if all  stars have planetary systems similar to ours.  There is a  small probability  of detecting planets with masses as low as the earth's.  A  null-result would  allow the investigators to const rain the existence of  planets.  ***",
