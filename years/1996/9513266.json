 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal outlines a three year program to develop a  compact coherent X-ray source that is suitable for  three-dimensional imaging of living organisms, tissue and  cells with macromolecular resolution. The imaging is to be  accomplished using X-ray rnicroholographic techniques. The  X-rays will be produced by exciting atornic clusters or  molecules with an intense ultrashort (femtosecond) laser  pulse in the ultraviolet (UV). The resulting multiphoton  ionization of the atoms in the clusters produces an  electron-ion plasma which interacts strongly with the  oscillating radiative field of the laser pulse. The  collective motion of the electrons, due to the field-induced  ponderomotive force, gives the electrons sufficient energy  to collisionally eject an inner-shell electron from an ion  in the cluster. A X-ray photon is emitted when an outer  shell electron fills the vacant inner shell state in the  \"hollow\" atom. Previous investigations have shown that the  efficiency of this nonlinear X-ray generation process is  increased if the interacting laser pulse is both intense  (i.e. short and energetic) and coherent (i.e. phase  controlled).    We describe an all solid-state, high-power UV femtosecond  laser system that is designed to be optimally suited for the  excitation of atomic clusters for the production of X-rays.  The laser system will be based on the new solid-state UV  laser material Ce doped LiSrAlF6 which operates between 280  and 320nm, and will employ femtosecond laser technology that  is already well established at wavelengths in the near  infrared (~ 800nm). In addition to its use in the X-ray  generation process, we expect this source of coherent UV  femtosecond pulses to find many applications in  spectroscopic biological research, e.g. the temporal  resolution of the water solvation dynamics in enzyme  reactions and other protein complexes.    We intend to use the coherent X-ray source produced using  the UV laser system to image chromosome dynamics during  mitosis and meio sis. The microholographic techniques that  have already been developed in our laboratories will enable  three dimensional images to be reconstructed, in contrast to  any other imaging technology available today with comparable  marcomolecular resolution. Using X-rays with a wavelength of  -l, this holographic technique should also allow the  structure of biological molecules to be visualized in three  dimensions without the need for crystallization. We propose  to explore this possibility by investigating the  avidin-biotin complex. The development of this laser-based  technology has the potential to replace expensive  synchrotron X-ray sources for imaging in the biological  sciences.",
