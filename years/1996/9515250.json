 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of participation and influence in groups, exploring both status expectations and the contextual constraint of gender composition.  This investigation develops a theoretical framework combining expectation-states theory and contextual elements, involving both inducements and restrictions.  In previous expectation-states conceptions, a group permits its members to participate and to prevail in disagreements according to their perceived abilities, the governing principle being that their primary motivation is to succeed at their collective task.  When we add the situational constraints arising from gender composition to this model, the implications for observable interaction patterns change.  This research project will investigate hypotheses about the differences, focusing on five-person problem-solving groups, employing 42 mock juries ranging in gender composition from all male to all female, with seven replications of each possible composition.   %%%   This research differs from prior studies in three significant ways.  First, it exploits enormous improvements in audio-visual technology, producing a much fuller audiotape and videotape record of the experimental sessions.  Second, drawing on this fuller information, it will produce a coding of the who-to-whom flows of interaction using a more discerning set of content categories, derived from the Bales IPA system and the Oregon MICS system.  Third, using mathematical modeling and associated data analytic procedures, it will confirm or disconfirm the expectation-states hypothesis and contextual hypotheses at issue, which in previous research either have not been jointly examined or have been confounded.  %%%   The anticipated result of this research is a better understanding of how external status and diffuse status-based constraints combine to shape participation and influence in task-oriented groups.  The tradition of research to which this study belongs has contributed significantly to improvement of group processes in commerce,  industry, education and government.  The findings from this particular study potentially will generalize to all kinds of decision-making groups.  Given that American decision-making groups are increasingly gender-diverse, this research will be of significant practical importance at the same time that it tests competing scientific theories.",
