 "awd_abstract_narration": "Training in the theory and practice of remote sensing and geographic information systems is becoming increasingly important in the training of environmental scientists for natural-resource and urban-growth management. The Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System for Undergraduate Training project is adding 12 computer workstations; 1 server platform for a local network and Internet connection; 1 hub platform to serve as the main database provider; 1 complete geographic positioning system capable of downloading data to the hub platform; 1 256-grey-level class-D scanner; and additional required software to support continued expansion of the environmental science curricula developed since 1985.    The use of these resources supports undergraduate training in ARC/INFO, ERDAS IMAGINE, and related systems in order to develop a professionally trained workforce to staff Federal, state, local, and private resource management agencies.  This project enables the Biological and Environmental Sciences Department to improve its curriculum and, at the same time, give students hands-on experience with systems used in the real world.  The ultimate outcome of the project may be Environmental Science graduates who are better prepared to enter a rapidly expanding job market or to continue in graduate education.",
