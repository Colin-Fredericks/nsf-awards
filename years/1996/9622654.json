 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622654  Melloy   This research will develop generic models which can accurately predict human performance in selected classes of complex  inspection tasks and can serve as a basis for selection and training of human inspectors.   The research is composed of seven tasks:  (1) development of a conceptual framework, (2) development of mathematical models, (3) development of computer based inspection training program, (4) model verification, (5) model validation in a controlled setting, (6) validation with field data, and (7) development of guidelines for inspection training.   Once developed, these models will support the design of training interventions, which will lead to enhanced inspector performance and consequent improvements in inspection quality.  Development and field testing will be done in cooperation with CIBA Vision Corporation, a manufacturer of contact lenses.  Contact lenses are FDA-regulated Class 2 medical devices and inspection is necessary to ensure compliance.  This provides an excellent testbed for evaluating both the accuracy and efficacy of the models developed and the ensuing training program.",
