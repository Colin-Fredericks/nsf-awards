This workshop will develop concrete research projects around the issues of mesoscale shelf processes, large-scale shelf dynamics, and issues concerning the impacts of these dynamics on several other biological, ecological and socio-economic processes.  The overlaps between these perspectives will be integrated during the proposed meetings to ensure that the various components of the program are well-connected.  The end product of the meetings will be a Phase II proposal for the IAI Start-Up Grants.  %%%  This proposal will support a series of meetings of the Southwestern Atlantic Program (SWAP).  In order to continue work that was begun at a workshop in December 1994, the SWAP group will hold a series of meetings to discuss mesoscale shelf processes, large-scale shelf dynamics, and issues concerning the impacts of these dynamics on several other biological, ecological and socio-economic processes.  The meetings will include physical and biological oceanographers as well as social and other environmental scientists whose goal would be to develop multidisciplinary projects focused on the impact of oceanic circulation on the ecology, on the environment and on sociological aspects in the coastal area extending from Cabo Frio in Brazil to Patagonia in Argentina.  The result of the meetings will be a Phase II IAI Start-Up Grants proposal.  This proposal includes participants from Argentina, Brazil, the United States, and Uruguay.  These countries are members of the IAI, an initiative to stimulate global change research among the scientific institutions of the Americas.  The National Science Foundation is the designated U.S. Government agency to carry out U.S. responsibilities within the IAI.  ***",
