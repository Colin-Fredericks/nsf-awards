 "awd_abstract_narration": "Depth images are used as rendering primitives in the high-performance graphics  engine that is being constructed in this project.  A depth image is a two-  dimensional image that includes depth relative to a viewpoint, in addition to  color and other properties.  From a small number of depth images, each of which  represents an arbitrarily complex scene from a single viewpoint, an image can be  computed for any viewpoint within the neighborhood of the original viewpoints.   This image-based rendering approach offers advantages in realism and distributing  the rendering computation among processors that generate depth images and those  that reproject them to new viewpoints.    The project is using the existing PixelFlow graphics engine to test the image-  based rendering ideas.  During the first part of the project, algorithms for  acquiring and pre-processing depth images will be investigated.  At the same  time, the PixelFlow machine will be enhanced for image acquisition and storage.   This will permit software for image-based rendering to run in real-time on the  PixelFlow machine, performing the following operations:  determination of  reference images to be used as sources of depth pixels, warping of reference  image pixels to the screen space, evaluation color, area, and other parameters  for each pixel, and blending of pixels to form the final reference image.  In  later stages of the project, hardware support may be developed and evaluated for  some of these operations.",
