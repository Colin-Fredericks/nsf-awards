 "awd_abstract_narration": "Birkeland, Karl W  Arizona State University   This project will investigate the variability of snowpack properties as a function of terrain and will examine also the relationship between snowpack data and snow stability throughout a mountain range.  The study site is the Bridger Mountains, Montana.  Sampling teams will collect data three times during the season.  Data on snowpack stability, strength, depth, and temperature will be compared with terrain features such as aspect, elevation, slope angle, and location within the mountain range.  In addition weekly data will be collected at a study plot in order to assess the evolution of the snowpack.  A variety of multivariate statistical methods will be used to test hypotheses.  Snowpack variations are hypothesized to occur in patterns that can be correlated to terrain.  In addition it is hypothesized that detailed data from a point can be used to approximate the condition of nearby slopes.  Results will show the association between snowpack and terrain at a scale that has yet to be examined.  The product will contribute to a more general knowledge of avalanche events and their causes.  In addition the results will have practical utility for avalanche professionals.",
