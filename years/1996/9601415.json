 "awd_abstract_narration": "Disputes about environmental risks often reflect fundamental disagreements about the definition and scope of the policy problem. Identifying how individuals frame or conceptually define complex issues about environmental risk may be a prerequisite for understanding the basis of many societal conflicts, and individual differences in responding. The framework imposed upon information affects the boundaries of discourse during a dispute, and frames-of reference influence what values are salient for a given issue. This set of `operating` values focuses individuals on specific aspects of the problem while guiding policy choices. How conceptual frames organize information and experiences regarding environmental risks, affect judgments and vary with the sociocultural context of exposure are the guiding questions of this research.  The project consists of two studies examining in detail the process and consequences of decision framing. Study #1 explores and measures in several lay populations the different conceptual frames that may be evoked to structure environmental risk problems, with a systematic look at the content of and variability in decision frames across different ethnic and socioeconomic groups. The project then considers how alternative framings of environmental risk issues, including an equity or justice perspective, may affect the subjective value of decision options, and whether effects are stable across different communities. The goal of an additional pilot study is to complete preliminary work for the construction of a scale measuring decision frames in diverse populations.  These studies target a variety of individuals for participation, including residents of lower-income urban communities. Objectives are explored through multiple methods including experimental, interview and multidimensional scaling procedures, and provide information about the validity and reliability of certain scientific procedures across diverse samples. From a policy perspective, results may have implications for the resolution of conflict about technology or environmental hazards, and the process of communicating about risk situations across a wide range of communities.",
