 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major objective of this project is to provide for the use of multimedia computers in mathematics and science courses. This step enables students to become more actively involved in their education and to better prepare themselves to participate in a society that is increasingly technological and scientific. The equipment used supports introductory and advanced courses in mathematics and the sciences, as well as courses in the general education program.   The new software allows students to develop models of natural phenomena, analyze data, and prepare presentations. The computer laboratory is used to introduce computer graphics, simulations, and modeling into the pedagogical style used in courses in the Departments of Mathematics and Sciences (biology, geology, environmental science, and chemistry). Students are able to access public domain software, databases, and information using the Internet. The computer laboratory is also used to assist faculty members to develop the skills required to benefit from the use of interactive multimedia in the classroom.   The overall emphasis here is not on equipment, but on active modes of student learning. The new hardware and software are intended to support and extend existing efforts to encourage students to be active, inquiring participants in their science and mathematics courses, rather than passive spectators. This laboratory provides for a learning community characterized by active engagement in teaching and learning, by high standards of academic work and human relations, and by seriousness of purpose.",
