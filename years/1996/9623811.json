 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623811  Makris  Semi-active dampers are receiving considerable attention for  seismic protection applications, including such devices  ranging from hydraulic dampers to electrorheological (ER)  fluid dampers.  The implementation of semi-active dampers in  real structures is challenged by a number of fundamental  research problems such as:a) Salability b) The required  dynamic range c) Control models and algorithms; d) Viscous  heating and temperature dependent effects.  In this project  a systematic effort is made to investigate the forementioned  issues is proposed. Specifically:  The hysteretic unique  property of electrorheological dampers to develop a  combination of hysteric and viscous forces will be further  exploited to develop a practical solution to protection of  structures from earthquakes.  The entire project is based on  a coordinated interdisciplinary effort with strong  industrial support and collaboration.   A comprehensive  education program will move forward together with the  research project to involve students in their class work,  laboratory testings, and analytical investigations.  This is  a FY96 Career award.  ***",
