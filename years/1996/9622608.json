 "awd_abstract_narration": "This awards supports the research of Professor D. Grayson to  continue the development of Macaulay 2. This system will enable  large scale research computing projects dealing with systems of  polynomial equations in many variables. He also hopes to work on  the connections between algebraic k-theory and motivic  cohomology.     This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the  oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to  the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems  that have stood for centuries. Originally, it treated figures  defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely  polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra,  but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is  extensively used in those fields.  Moreover it has proved itself  useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer  science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.  The software  being developed here will make many previously difficult or  impossible computations in this field possible.",
