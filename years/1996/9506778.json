 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506778  Wilson         This award provides $28,000 as 49% of the costs of acquiring  two Trimble 4000SSE dual frequency geodetic receivers and  associated field equipment. The University of Texas at Austin will  provide 51% of these costs.  These two receivers will become part  of the UNAVCO pool, available to outside researchers for up to 6  months each year. UNAVCO participation provides technical and  repair support as well. The two new receivers will supplement two  existing UT Austin Trimble 4000SSE's currently available through  the UNAVCO pool for up to 3 months each year. The two existing  receivers were purchased and upgraded entirely with University of  Texas local funds. The new receivers are required to support  expanding GPS activities in a variety of graduate and  undergraduate educational and research programs at the University  of Texas within the Departments of Geological Sciences and  Aerospace Engineering, and through organized research units  including the Center for Space Research, Institute for  Geophysics, and Bureau of Economic Geology. The receivers will be  used in organized instructional activities in both undergraduate  and graduate field and geodesy courses to provide essential GPS  training to students in engineering and earth sciences. Research  applications include development of advanced GPS data processing  methods, monitoring of active tectonics in areas which include  the South Pacific and southern Rio Grande Rift, monitoring Gulf  of Mexico shoreline changes, and providing precise navigation for  a variety of geological and geophysical field programs.  ***",
