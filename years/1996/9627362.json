 "awd_abstract_narration": "Natural history collections of mollusk shells are subject to a form of degradation known as OByneOs DiseaseO if they are improperly housed.  ByneOs disease is a crystalline efflorescence on the surface of the shells that is formed by the reaction of acid vapors that are released by wood, cardboard, and paper storage materials with the calcium carbonate of the shells themselves. It is promoted by high and fluctuating temperature and humidity.  The Pacific mollusk collection of the Bishop Museum is the most comprehensive in the world, containing over 6,000,000 specimens. As such, it is a major resource for studies in biodiversity, conservation, and phylogeny.  However, the collection is suffering from ByneOs disease.  This award will provide the materials and staff to properly conserve the collection by carefully cleaning the efflorescence from the shells, transferring them into modern, acid-free trays, boxes and glass vials that will be stored within existing and new steel collections cases, and making new, computerized labels for the collections.  The outcome of the project will be a well curated, computer-catalogued and properly conserved collection that will be available for study and research well into the future.",
