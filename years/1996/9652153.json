 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Community College of Philadelphia (CCP), recognizing that the body of knowledge taught in our undergraduate studies curricula does not reflect required linkages of science, technology and social science content, proposes to develop and implement a new undergraduate curriculum entitled `Culture, Science and Technology.`     During the past two years, a Faculty Steering Committee has developed a structure for the new curriculum and has identified courses meeting the educational objectives in the degree programs. The Steering Committee also proposed innovative student support systems including learning communities, collaborative learning and supplemental instruction to assist our diverse student body to be successful in preparing for careers in science, math and technology.    To implement the proposed curriculum, a group of faculty will identify common themes, curricular materials, and pedagogical methods (based on prior innovations in science, math and technology) that will enhance students' understanding of the interactive and complex relationship between culture and technology.   CCP anticipates enrolling 3,400 students and training 150 faculty over the proposed three- year developmental period. The College is making a major in-kind contribution to the development of the curriculum and is committed to the program's continuation at the close of the funding period, as well as extensive evaluation and dissemination of results. Due to the size of CCP and diversity of our student body, our proposed curriculum would serve as a model for two-year schools struggling to develop a curriculum involving a systematic study of the natural sciences, related technology and their interrelationship with a changing society.",
