 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612358  Kelly    This conference proposal brings a total of 200 teachers, at least 50 of whom are directly funded through this award, from across the country to the Supercomputing '96 in Pittsburgh, PA , for three  days of conference workshops.  This year the workshops and the educational theme are integrated into the whole conference, with open sessions appropriate for teachers and for computer scientists and technicians.  The educational strand includes hands-on workshops, presentations and demonstrations by experts as well as teachers in currently successful high school supercomputing programs.  Teachers will pay their own reduced registration for Supercomputing '96 and can visit the exhibits, poster sessions, keynote address and special presentations at the conference.    Other commitments are expected to support 150 additional teachers.  Many other expenses are covered through other agencies or other participation such as hardware rental, all the PI time, web access, sustained on-line interactions after the meeting, etc.   The only expense for which funds have been requested is that which will go directly for participant support.    Formal cost sharing is $3200 of administrative fees is committed by IEEE, slightly less than 1%. However, all personnel, equipment and other costs are supported by the conference.",
