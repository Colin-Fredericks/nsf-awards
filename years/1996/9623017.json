 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Michael L. Klein is supported by a grant from the Theoretical   and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research in the area   of computer simulation and modeling of structural and dynamical phenomena   in molecular solids and polar fluids.  Both classical molecular dynamics   and Car-Parrinello ab initio molecular dynamics will be used to   characterize the behavior of a variety of condensed molecular systems   including polymers, metal-ammonia solutions,  and organo-lithium   compounds.  A path integral version of Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics   will be used to study quantum phenomena such as proton motion in selected   solids and liquids.  Attempts will also be made to develop and implement   novel methodologies and algorithms for condensed phase simulations with   increasing emphasis on massively parallel computing.  Computer simulation of molecular systems is providing many rich insights   into chemical behavior at the molecular level.  As the computer   algorithms and force field models continue to improve,  it becomes   possible to study larger systems, and to gain useful insights regarding   more and more physical and chemical properties.  Using a combination of   simulation techniques including molecular dynamics, quantum Monte Carlo,   and Car-Parinello theory, Klein is able to perform computer simulations   on systems consisting of large numbers of molecules such as crystalline   substances, and metal ammonia solutions.  He is able to study a number of   important chemical and physical properties of interest in the design of   new materials.",
