 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626297  Tang    This award provides support for the acquisition of an x-ray  powder diffractometer with a high temperature attachment for  materials research.  This powder diffractometer offers state-  ofthe-art performance for crystal structure determination,  particle size analysis, measurements of crystallinity and  disorder, identification of impurity phases, and  determinations of solid solubility and phase diagram.  It  has a fully automatic alignment capability and is equipped  with an advanced software system.  It is highly versatile  and can function as a 0/0 goniometer or in vertical or  horizontal mode to satisfy any present and future needs.  the goniometer radii can be easily adjusted enabling the  selection of the best resolution for application.  The high  temperature attachment is designed for automatic recording  of crystal structure changes of a specimen at elevated  temperatures (up to 1400 C).  It will be mounted on the x-  ray diffractometer and can operate in vacuum, air or inert  gasses.  This x-ray diffractometer is crucial to the success  of many research projects at the University of New Orleans,  including studies of various electronic and Magnetic  materials and their processingstructure-property  relationships.  These projects include investigation on the  magnetotransport properties of insulatormetal or insulator-  semiconductor nanocomposites in which giant  magnetoresistance (GMR) may be found; study of a group of  new and very promising high density magneto-optical  recording materials CuCr2Se4-x Asx; and study of  photomagnetic effects in intermetallic spin glasses.  In  addition, diffractometer will enable us to conduct more  effectively research activities in high strength permanent  magnets, superconductors, spin glasses, heavy fermions,  biomaterials, polymer-nanoparticle composites, microporous  solids, carbon and related materials, coatings and their  tribological properties.  the development of materials with  novel and useful magnetic and electronic pro perties is of  strategic importance for the nation's technological and  economic growth.  %%%  The diffractometer will enhance the research capabilities of  the faculty at the University of New Orleans and will also  be available to the researchers at Tulane University,  Louisiana State University, Xavier University and Louisiana  State University Medical Center.  Through the acquisition of  this instruments, students will have much greater  opportunities to participate in materials research  activities and be provided access and training on a state-of-  the-art instrument.  ***",
