 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to create a new interactive computer laboratory, dedicated to the visualization, manipulation, and analysis of Earth Science data for MSU undergraduate students. It is important for students, as future teachers, scientists, and citizens, to know how to work with and analyze quantitative data. The equipment purchased would allow the Department: I ) to provide hands-on experience, education, and training for Geoscience undergraduates in quantitative geography, geology, geophysics, remote sensing, Geographic Information System (GIS), and computer mapping; 2) to give more stimulating and improved learning experience through modern educational technology to students enrolled in general education and science electives, particularly pre-service teachers and introductory Geoscience students utilizing state-of-the-art hardware and software; 3) to provide more productive education and experience in the senior year for Geosciences undergraduates than presently available; and 4) to establish a bridge between undergraduate and graduate curricula of the Department. Geoscience introductory mapping and image interpretation courses have recently been modified to introduce students to digital image processing and GIS. The new equipment will be used in those beginning courses; a new, digital processing-based, intermediate level Geoscience course, and senior courses in remote sensing/GIS/computer mapping. Planned evaluation and dissemination of the impact of the project are discussed in the proposal. Implementation of this plan will impact both majors in Geosciences and non-majors with regard to modern technologies associated with the rapidly growing fields of remote sensing, GIS, and computer mapping.",
