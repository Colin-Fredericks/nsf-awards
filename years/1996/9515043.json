 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research consists of two related projects.  The first is a  theoretical and empirical investigation of the connection between  investment flow, employment growth, and productivity growth at  the plant level, as well as the consequent aggregate  implications.  This research will include the development of  theoretical models and an empirical evaluation of the resulting  propositions using the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD).   Important issues to be investigated include: the relevance of  non-convexities in the capital and labor adjustment process, the  connection between these factor flows and productivity growth and  associated aggregate i  implications.  The second topic analyzes financial markets and  the flow of inputs across plant sits.  The theme here is that the  financial markets facilitate the flow of capital across  production units due to differences in productivity at the  various sites. Theoretical models stressing the implications of  plant and sector specific shocks will be analyzed under  alternative assumptions about the structure of factor and  financial markets.  The LRD will then be used to evaluate  implications of the models developed under these alternative  hypotheses.",
