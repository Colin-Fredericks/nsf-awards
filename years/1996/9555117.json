 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent concern about the declining interest in science on  the part of students and the need for increased science  literacy on the part of the general public has led to  recognition of the importance of making special efforts to  reach non-science majors and future teachers. One possible  approach to this problem is to develop courses that have a  reduced emphasis on terminology and equations and a greater  emphasis on those aspects of the science that are tangible  and relevant to students' lives and experiences. For the  past five years, I have been teaching a General Education  course entitled Geology and People. The goal of the course  is to draw students' attention to some of the many ways in  which geologic factors have been and still are influencing  societies, civilizations and cultures. The material in the  course is drawn from a variety of fields including history,  economics, political science, and archaeology as well as  art, music and literature. I believe the material that I  have gathered for the course can make a useful contribution  to the development of new paradigms for introductory earth  science courses for non-majors and teachers.    The interconnections between different components make it  inappropriate to disseminate the material through a text or  a reader. To overcome this problem, I propose to establish  an Internet site on the World Wide Web.  The Website would  be available free to anyone wishing to access the material  pertaining to the influences of geology on people's lives..  The Website would be constructed in a way that emphasized  pathways and linkages between information. Individuals would  use the Website to find information that they could  incorporate into their own courses. This approach represents  a new paradigm for the dissemination of curricular material.",
