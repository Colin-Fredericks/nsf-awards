 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research the goal is to develop a nonparametric adaptive  communications receiver strategy by exploiting results from the theory of  universal classification and data compression. Analysis based upon the  \"typicality\" of the data has become one of the primary theoretical and  practical concepts in modern information theory. The so-called \"Type\"  (appropriate histogram estimators of the amplitude distribution) have not  only been shown to be sufficient statistics for both classification and  compression, but have also been shown to converge exponentially fast to the  true underlying distribution. Because type-based detectors make no a priori  assumptions about the channel characteristics and measure the quantities  needed to provide asymptotically optimal reception, these detectors can  theoretically achieve the same exponential error rate as the clairvoyant  receiver that knows the channel characteristics perfectly and uses them  optimally. Measurements made during succeeding transmissions, possibly  using the data transmissions themselves in a decision feedback paradigm,  can be used to track channel variations. The approach will be extended to  deal with intersample dependencies and colored noise by using channel  measurements in an optimally effective way. Two techniques drawn from data  compression work, context trees and Lempel-Ziv (universal) coding, will be  examined to determine which represents channel-induced dependencies most  efficiently and which is most adaptable. By merging systems based on these  two theories, a receiver that adapts to unknown, time-varying channels will  be developed. It will be demonstrated that this receiver can be used in  multiuser channels, both wireless and optical fiber, with little  modification. The research will develop the theoretical underpinnings of  this adaptive receiver strategy, and will develop a complete software  implementation of the receiver, using as test data actual communication  channel recordings.  This work will be performed  by a close collaboration  of researchers from Rice University and George Mason University.",
