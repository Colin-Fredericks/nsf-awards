 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current trends in linguistics differ from each other in several  ways; nonetheless, many of the differences have polarized around  two persuasions known as the formalist approach and the  functionalist approach. The two directions are assumed by most to  be mutually exclusive and in competition. As a result,  practitioners of each approach have been working in relative  isolation from those of the opposite trend, with instances of  cross-fertilization or even attempts at clarifying the critical  issues few and far between.    Divisiveness within a field of inquiry is counterproductive; if  the rift is underlain by differences whose nature has not been  fully enunciated and examined, it is doubly so. The proposed  conference on functionalism and formalism in linguistics directly  addresses this aspect of the current state of the field by  adopting two central goals. One is to lay out a small set of  basic parameters in terms of which the basic assumptions of each  approach can be explicated and contrasted. The clarification of  the similarities and differences between the two approaches  provides the grounds for addressing our second objective: to  assess the extent to which the two approaches are compatible and  to explore ways in which insights of one approach may benefit the  other. Given that the formalism-functionalism dichotomy is a  meaningful one in other areas of humanities and social sciences  as well, the results of the conference may contribute to the  rapprochement of the two directions both inside and outside  linguistics.",
