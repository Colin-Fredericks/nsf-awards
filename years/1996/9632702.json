 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632702  Mazumdar       The purpose of the proposed project is to find suitable  methods for obtaining the statistical distribution of electric  power system production costs by taking into account the major  sources of uncertainty that include generator outages, load, and  fuel prices.  Information on the distributions is important for  risk evaluation, fuel inventory planning, model validation, and  sensitivity analysis of planning decisions.  A distinguishing  feature of the project will be explicit modeling of the  stochastic processes associated with these generation outages and  chronological load.  The determination of the expected values of  these distributions does not require the consideration of these  random processes, but for computation of higher order statistics  such as the standard deviation or estimating the entire  distribution, this is necessary.  Consideration of these  processes for estimating the temporal correlations between the  amounts of energy production makes the analytical computations  difficult and challenging.  It is argued in the proposal that  this work will maintain its relevance after deregulation and the  arrival of the competitive market structure in the operation of  electric power companies.  ***",
