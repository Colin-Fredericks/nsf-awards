 "awd_abstract_narration": "Following the direction provided by the XVIII Antarctic  Treaty Consultative Meeting (1994), the Scientific Committee  on Antarctic Research (SCAR) issued a Call for Proposals to  Operate an Antarctic Master Directory for a period of at  least five years.  The International Centre for Antarctic  Information and Research (ICAIR) was selected by SCAR and  the Committee of National Managers of Antarctic Programs  (COMNAP) to establish and operate the Antarctic Master  Directory (AMD)on behalf of the various national programs.    Using the basic format of NASA's Global Change Master  Directory (GCMD) which is part of an existing International  Directory Network, ICAIR will design a data model for an  Antarctic Data Directory System.  An integral component of  this model will be development and dissemination of a  Directory Interchange Format (DIF) consistent with existing  international data networks but expanded to better enable  description of data sets that are unique to Antarctic  research.  ICAIR will also establish links with National  Antarctic Data Centers (NADCs), supporting them and other  groups collecting Antarctic data, and coordinating the  Antarctic DIF with them.  The DIF developed will be  disseminated to all NADCs for their use in managing  Antarctic research data information.  The AMD is envisioned  as a meta data center with World Wide Web links to the NADCs  and serving, at least initially, as a repository for  information about the data held by the NADCs.",
