 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project studies the applicability of composite moment resisting frame systems made of composite Steel Reinforced Concrete (SRC) columns and steel beams for zones of moderate-to-high seismic risk.  The seismic design philosophy for composite moment resisting frame systems is based on developing a desirable beam-sidesway mechanism, where ductile steel beam flexural hinging develops throughout the building and hinging develops at the first story column-foundation interfaces.  The research tasks include:  (a) experimental subassemblage testing to evaluate various reinforcing details for composite SRC columns and beam-column joint regions that provide efficient energy dissipation capacity and deformation capability during seismic loading scenarios.  The response behavior of the subassemblages will be investigated for continuous steel beams through the joint with and without floor slab interaction by headed shear studs (b) experimental subassemblage testing to evaluate various reinforcing details to ensure sufficient strength and deformation capability at the critical first story SRC column-concrete foundation interface, and (c) analytical studies using the well-established nonlinear analysis program IDARC to model the response behavior using data from previous subassemblage testing and this research study.  Parametric studies will be performed to identify important hysteretic properties in the composite subassemblages and expanded to evaluate the response behavior of complete composite moment resisting frame systems during earthquake excitations.  The applicability of the results to develop design guidelines and reinforcing detail requirements for composite moment resisting frame systems during earthquake excitations.  The applicability of the results to develop design guidelines and reinforcing detail requirements for composite moment resisting frame structural systems made of composite SRC columns and steel beams for zones of moderate-to-high seismic risk will be evaluated.",
