This conference is primarily concerned with the biology of a variety of prokaryotic and lower eukaryotic systems.  It is the major annually occurring international meeting devoted to this subject area and is often where new \"emerging\" genetic systems are first described.  The meeting has always been open to all researchers working in the field of genetic exchange and related areas, including DNA repair, restriction-modification systems and recombination pathways.  A major strength of the meetings has been the diversity of genetic systems represented; this diversity has provided a fertile environment for new ideas, and for applying well-established concepts to newly emerging genetic systems.  Historically, a significant feature of these meetings has been their accessibility to graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.  Support is being provided for those young researchers who demonstrate need and are presenting work at the meeting.  Research discussed at this meeting is important because of the applications of research in microbial genetics and physiology to biotechnology.  ***",
