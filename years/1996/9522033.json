 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522033  Curtis  This proposal is on research to develop reactor design and  operational principles for large-scale cultivation of root  cultures for the production of biologically active chemicals such  as pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and flavors.  Preliminary studies  have indicated that oxygen delivery is the fundamental design  constraint for reactor scale-up.Therefore, the primary measures  of reactor performance will be tissue respiration and biomass  accumulation which are assessed by off-gas analysis and nutrient  depletion correlations, respectively.  Experiments will elucidate  the role of gas dispersion, liquid mixing and diffusion of oxygen  within the root tissue on reactor performance.  Gas dispersion  will be measured by argon tracer analysis/mass spectrometry,  while liquid mixing will be assessed by dye tracers for both  submerged and trickle-bed reactor operations.  Also, oxygen  diffusion within the root axis has been shown to limit  respiration; therefore a study of root growth and respiration for  a range of root species will be performed to experimentally  validate a diffusionally controlled model for root biological  oxygen demand.  ***",
