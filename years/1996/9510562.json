 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510562  Johnson    This proposal focuses upon the synthesis of new ternary  transition metal chalcogenides which contain discrete  clusters of transition metal atoms. The ternary molybdenum  chalcogenides and the alkali metal intercalates of the  fullerines are both examples of this class of compounds,  containing discrete but interacting cluster entities. Both  of these classes of materials have been found to have a host  of unusual properties ranging from catalytic activity to  superconductivity which have been rationalized as resulting  from the unique cluster structure found in these materials.  The goal is to prepare tungsten, niobium and tantalum  compounds which are isostructural analogs of the ternary  molybdenum chalcogenides. The preparation of isostructural  and isoelectronic compounds to the ternary molybdenum  compounds will permit the testing of these structure based  arguments and will hopefully extend the range of properties  found in this unique class of materials which is some sense  bridges the gap between discrete molecular compounds and  extended structures .  %%%  Chemical reactions involving solids at low temperatures are  very sluggish even though there is often a large driving  force for the reactions. Previous attempts to prepare new  ternary transition metal chalcogenides which contain  discrete clusters of transition metal atoms via reactions  between the elements have only produced mixtures of binary  compounds or other ternary structures. This is probably  because the desired compounds are thermodynamically unstable  with respect to the known compounds in these phase diagrams.  Consequently, the key to the success to their synthesis will  be avoiding the formation of stable binary compounds as  reaction intermediates. Towards this end, a kinetically  controlled route to solid-state compounds is developed based  upon the design of elemental superlattices as uniquely  tailorable reactants. This approach separates the two key  steps of a solid state reaction - interdi ffusion of the  reactants and nucleation of the products. Since product  formation is controlled by the lucleation barriers, one is  able to kinetically control the product formed. The  development of synthetic tools to nucleate desired  structures is a significant part of the proposed research.",
