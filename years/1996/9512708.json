 "awd_abstract_narration": "9512708  Cummins    The proposed U.S.-Brazil collaborative research will use  experiments with a class of materials closely related to  metallic alloys to test a recently advanced non-steady-state  theory of interface evolution.  Based on materials  discovered in 1965 but using techniques of videomicroscopy  and computerized image analysis, the relevant  characteristics of the interface profile and solute  concentration field will be observed, extracted, and  analyzed.  The project, led by Herman Cummins at CUNY in New  York and Oscar Mesquita at the Universidade Federal de Minas  Gerais in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, will use equipment  available at both sites.  A second objective will be to  investigate the nature of the planar-to-cellular  bifurcation, with potential implications for materials  preparation and design.    The research addresses a question of both theoretical and  practical importance using the latest methods.  The ability  to attack complex, non-linear problems of the nature  proposed has only developed in the past few years, opening  the way for the proposed research.  The project pairs U.S.  and Brazilian investigators with experience in related  problems, promising valuable results.    ***",
