 "awd_abstract_narration": "Type safety is an essential feature of advanced programming  environments for the rapid development of reliable software,  but it is not sufficient. Programmers try to eliminate as  many errors as possible by reasoning about the program's  behavior. To support this activity, this research seeks to  design and construct smart programming environments. A smart  programming environment is a system for writing, editing,  executing, and analyzing programs. For the latter, the  environment includes \"soft type checkers\", tools for  verifying simple program invariants. Most notably, these are  the preconditions for each program operation.  Two prototypes of soft type checkers for Scheme have been  developed, based on different analysis methods. One uses an  adaptation of Hindley-Milner type inference (for a non-  standard type algebra); the other uses a form of set-based  analysis. This research would extend the tools, and seeks  (1) to develop a new class of soft typers that combine the  advantages of Hindley-Milner and set-based analysis, (2) to  incorporate additional verification technology, (3) to  develop alternative interfaces for exploring the verifier's  reasoning, and (4) to extend the tools for modular  programming. In addition, ways are being explored to  transfer the technology to lower-level languages, such as a  safe sublanguage of C++ (similar to Java) in the programming  environment.  ***",
