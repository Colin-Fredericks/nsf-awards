 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for a project to study affine and  double affine Hecke algebras. The latter algebras (recently  introduced by the principal investigator) lead to a new approach  to various problems in representation theory, special functions,  harmonic analysis, conformal field theory,  combinatorics,  topology, and number theory. The main objectives are (1) the  theory of differential and difference operators acting on  polynomials, theta functions and various generalizations, (2)  representations of double affine Hecke algebras at roots of  unity, connections with the monodromy of the double affine KZ  equations and elliptic braid groups, (3) the action of the  modular group on the Macdonal polynomials, (4) relations to  quantum groups of elliptic type, Kac-Moody algebras, matrix  models, and W-algebras, and (5) applications to harmonic  analysis.   This research is in the general area of  Combinatorics. Combinatorics  attempts to find efficient methods  to study how discrete collections of  objects can be arranged.  The behavior of discrete systems is extremely  important to  modern communications. For example, the design of large   networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the  design of  algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets  of objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research. This  research also deals with orthogonal polynomials, which are useful  in designing optical transmission lines.",
