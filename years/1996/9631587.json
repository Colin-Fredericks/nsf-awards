 "awd_abstract_narration": "9613587  Blanchard  The goal of this research is to provide opportunities for  senior students in the Biological and Agricultural  Engineering (BAE) Department at North Carolina State  University to design, build, and deliver projects to aid the  disabled.  The completed projects will be given to specific  clients or groups of clients to the Tammy Lynn Center (which  provides residential and educational programs for children  and adults with developmental delays) and the Governor  Morehead School (the only state-supported school in North  Carolina specializing solely in comprehensive educational  and residential programs for students with visual  impairments), both in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Through this  effort, BAE students will be able to directly improve the  quality of one or more lives while gaining valuable design  experience for themselves.  They will also be exposed to new  possibilities for future study and work in rehabilitation  engineering.  Twenty-one potential projects have been  identified by the staff at the Tammy Lynn Center (e.g.,  outdoor swing for an adult wheel chair, voice-activated  multi-sensory toy with interchangeable parts, low cost bath  chair for raising and lowering a 100%-assisted person,  etc.), while six additional projects have been proposed by  the staff at the Governor Morehead School (e.g., balanced  ball that makes a sound or plays music only when triggered  by a remote device, combination locks that can be used by  the visually impaired on their school lockers).   The  proposal anticipates the design, building, and delivery of  an average of 12 projects per year over a 5-year period.  ***",
