 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability of a few insect species to use chemical compounds acquired from their host plants to defend themselves against their own predators, has fascinated biologists for over a century.  Nevertheless, relatively little is known about the biochemical mechanisms that enable only a few species to store these compounds.  Dr. Bowers will use DNA sequencing to determine the evolutionary relationships among a group of butterflies which has species that can store toxic compounds, iridoid glycosides, and species that cannot.  This phylogeny will then be used to examine the evolution of hostplant use patterns in  this insect group and the evolution of the biochemical mechanisms enabling some species to store these compounds.    The results of this research will provide a phylogenetic framework in which to examine the evolution of unpalatability in insects.  Dr. Bowers will apply the techniques learned during this year to many aspects of her future research and her training of students in evolutionary ecology.  Understanding the mechanisms that enable insects to cope with chemical compounds they encounter in their hostplants may also inform our understanding of how insects cope with chemical compounds, such as pesticides and herbicides, that have more recently become a part of their environment.",
