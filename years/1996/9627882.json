 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Russell P. Hughes, Department of Chemistry, Dartmouth College, is   supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of   the Chemistry Division to determine how transition metals make and break   carbon-carbon bonds. To investigate the scope of metal-mediated   carbon-carbon cleavage and formation, detailed mechanistic studies will   be carried out for the reversible insertion of metal centers into the   carbon-carbon bonds of cyclopropenyl rings. As the product of   metal-mediated carbon-carbon forming reactions is often dependent on the   conformational properties of the metal complex, `sticky` fluorinated   substituents will be attached to cyclopentadienyl rings to control   conformational properties of metal complexes containing two   cyclopentadienyl ligands. This will force the self-assembly of   dissymmetric and asymmetric complexes from two achiral cyclopentadienyl   ligands. New valence isomers of the metal-cyclopentadienyl fragment and   new transition metal complexes containing metal-carbon and   metal-heteroatom multiple bonds will be produced through  harnessing the   steric strain imparted by adjacent tertiary butyl groups on cyclopropenyl   and cyclopentadienyl rings to force skeletal rearrangements.  Transition metal complexes promote very selective catalytic and   stoichiometric transformations of organic compounds. Since many of these   reactions involve the activation of normally inert bonds, it is of   considerable interest to understand how metal centers make and break   bonds between carbon atoms. This study aims toward a fundamental   understanding of such processes. The detailed knowledge that will be   obtained will permit an increased usage and expansion of metal catalysts   and will permit the catalysts to be fine tuned in order to precisely   control chemical reactions.",
