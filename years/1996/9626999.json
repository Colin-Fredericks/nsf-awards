 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626999  Hanson    \"Under the Rock: An Experiment in Neighborhood Exhibit-Making\" is  a project that will engage children in the development of exhibits  as well as present information about backyard ecology.  The  Children's Museum staff will work with Federated Dorchester  Neighborhood Houses (a group of inner city neighborhood centers in  Boston) to develop a model activity that uses the theory and  practice of exhibit making as a tool to engage children in science  learning in their neighborhoods.  They will work with children and  their parents in the exploration of insect life in their urban  settings and presentation of their findings in exhibits the  children will make.  Exhibit making includes the entire process of:  studying live insects, doing research, writing text, designing and  building interactive activities for an exhibit about insects, and  marketing the exhibit.  Exhibit making has been chosen as the  pedagogical technique because it parallels creative work done in  the real world; it involves people working together in teams, and  utilizes different skills and intelligences of the participants.   In addition to the exhibits, other results of this project will  include: an educator's guidebook documenting the process of  exhibit-making in community centers; a proposal for an activity  book for kids with writing samples and illustrations that will be  submitted to a publisher; video and electronic resources; and  contributions and recommendations for the Museum's \"Under the Rock\"  exhibit, a new exhibit to be developed subsequent to the completion  of the first two phases of this project.",
