The workshop will be held at the University of  New England in Armidale, New South Wales, Australia, in late  January 1996.  The American organizers of the workshop are   Dr. H. Paul Friesma, Director of the Environmental Policy Program  at Northwestern University, and Dr. Ronald Sundell, leader of the  ecology and natural resources team of the Argonne National  Laboratory Center for Environmental Restoration Systems.  The  Australian organizer is Prof. John J. Pigram, Executive Director  of the Center for Water Policy Research at the University of New  England.  The workshop is being conducted under the U.S.-  Australia Cooperative Science Program and support in Australia is  provided through the Australian Department of Industry, Science  and Technology (DIST).    Biophysical, sociocultural and managerial factors need to be  considered in the selection and delineation of park and natural  reserve sites.  A key question is the determination of boundaries  which will incorporate appropriate resource attributes and  contribute towards the attainment of the goals and objectives of  park management.  Park and reserve boundary delineation issues  are receiving increasing attention in both the U.S. and Australia  as parks and reserves come under increasing pressure from a range  of sources.  The workshop will consider the assessments of  ecological attributes, biophysical variables, managerial  considerations and community attitudes deemed essential in the  establishment and maintenance of parks and reserves.  The  workshop provides a timely opportunity to discuss common  problems and concerns in the two countries.",
