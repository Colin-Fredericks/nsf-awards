 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates the generation of manufacturing tests for highly  sequential VLSI circuits.  The approach is based on combining the best features  of deterministic and simulation based techniques.  Deterministic techniques are  mainly used to (1) identify untestable and redundant faults and (2) to correct  the direction of the simulation based search.  Simulation based test vector  generation examines a set of test vectors to determine a new test sequence to  detect some faults.  This process, while accurate and fast, generates longer than  necessary test vectors.  The technique being explored is detecting and correcting  the genetic search, using deterministic ATPG.  This process involves an intricate  exploration of the power of a switch-level logic and fault simulator in an  combination with a genetic algorithm and the deterministic ATPG during the test  generation process.  The technique is being applied to design problems such as,  circuit partitioning, initial test set finding, and circuit initialization-  structure to determine performance and quality of generated test sets.",
