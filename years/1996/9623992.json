The types of structures  to  be  studied  include   nanocrystalline  and  metastable-phase  compounds   and  alloys,   and  novel  multilayer  and  particulate  nanocomposite  systems.   Special  attention  will  be  paid  to  the  thin-film  synthesis  of  these  materials  by  epitaxial  stabilization  of  nanoscaled  crystal structures which do not exist in  bulk  form,  and  by rapid thermal-processing methods.  A significant emphasis  of  this  program is on fundamental understanding of  the  inter-  particle   or  inter-grain  interactions,  phase-transition   and  coercivity behavior, and electronic structure and magneto-optical  properties of these novel materials.  %%%  The  synthesis  and  control of the magnetic properties  of  thin  films  play  an  extremely important role in modern  science  and  society.  A significant aspect of this is our growing ability  to  artificially structure novel materials at the nanometer scale  (1  nanometer  equals about four atomic diameters) and  to  fabricate  such  materials  into  devices with properties  and  applications  which  were hardly imagined only a decade ago.  A large  part  of  the  interest  in  nanoscaled magnetic  films  is  stimulated  by  information  storage and magnetoelectronic  devices.   In  recent  decades the information density in computer hard disk drives  has  been  increasing at the rate of about a factor  of  10  every  10  years  and  recently the rate has increased.   This  progress  is  dependent  on  major  advances in understanding  and  control  of  nanostructured magnetic materials, which is the subject  of  this  research.  ***",
