 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Virginia Urban Corridor Teacher Preparation Collaborative is a  joint effort of the liberal arts and science and education  faculties of universities and colleges (Longwood College, Mary  Washington College, Norfolk State University, and Virginia  Commonwealth University) who train the large majority of  prospective teachers within Virginia's urban corridor, the region's  Community Colleges (Germana, J. Sargeant Reynolds, Tidewater), the  Virginia Mathematics and Science Coalition,  and the regional  school systems.    The goal of the Collaborative is to implement programs that will  prepare K-8 teachers who have strong science and mathematics  backgrounds, who  enjoy science and mathematics, who understand  what is known about the types of teaching that enable students to  learn, and whose teaching will reflect their scientific and  pedagogical knowledge.    The Collaborative will put in place policies that require and  encourage prospective teachers to study more, and more appropriate,  science and mathematics. All science and mathematics courses taken  by prospective K-8 teachers will be renewed and reformed by  adapting the \"best practices\" being developed nationwide. Course  revision teams will include faculty from science disciplines,  education departments, and master teachers from the school systems.  A cadre of Clinical Faculty will work to improve all aspects of   the teacher preparation program, including the in-school  experiences of prospective and new teachers.  Recruitment and  retention efforts will enlist students in a teacher preparation   program to work with the faculty as Teaching Associates.  The  Collaborative will include three cross-fertilization/dissemination  activities:  an annual week-long Science and Mathematics  colloquium;  an annual four-week long Institute featuring courses  which are being developed by Collaborative institutions, and a  published journal devoted to the  preparation of prospective K-8  teachers in  science and mathematics.  This Collaborativ e will  impact policies required for preparation of K-8 teachers; improve  the  nature and quality of instruction in mathematics and the  sciences; improve in-school experiences of prospective teachers;  enhance recruitment of qualified teachers of science and  mathematics, particularly for underrepresented groups; and promote  the dissemination of materials and approaches within the  Collaborative and beyond.",
