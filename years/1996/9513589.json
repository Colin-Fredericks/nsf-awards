 "awd_abstract_narration": "9513589  Beyer  This research involves the details of the basic cellular machinery involved in eukaryotic gene expression, specifically at the level of pre-mRNA splicing and 3' end formation.  An unusual in vivo ultrastructural approach, the \"Miller chromatin spreading procedure\", will be used to analyze co-transcriptional events on specific genes after their microinjection into Xenopus laevis oocyte nuclei.  One can visualize multiple copies of specific genes on extrachromosomal plasmid vectors and gain global information concerning structural aspects of RNA transcription and processing at the resolution of the individual gene and the individual transcript.  Studies will concentrate on the very early stages of splice site recognition and spliceosome assembly on constitutively spliced introns.  There is little understanding of how splice sites are paired across typical long introns.  The ultrastructural approach has revealed that splice sites are recognized and paired within seconds of their synthesis, even for long introns of 10-20 kilobases.  The ultrastructure is consistent with the possibility that, once synthesized, 5' splice sites are somehow tethered near the site of RNA emergence from the polymerase in order to be paired with the next recognized 3' splice site.  Experiments are designed to test the involvement of various cis and transacting factors in the early intron recognition phenomenon regardless of whether or not tethering is involved, and also to test the possibility of a tethering mechanism.  The second specific objective is to use this ultrastructural assay to determine the mechanism of transcript release at the end of a gene, and to distinguish the relative contributions of polyadenylation signals and termination/pause signals to this process.  Genes will be visualized in a transcriptionally active state for determination of the gene length and density of the transcripts at the 3' end of the gene, yielding direct visual information on the site(s) of transcript release, the mode  of transcript release (cleavage or termination), the efficiency of transcript release, and the possible role of transcriptional pausing in transcript release.  Two alternative models for transcript release have been proposed, both of which accommodate the known dependence of transcript release on a functional poly(A) signal, (i.e., co-transcriptional RNA cleavage at the poly(A) site vs alteration of the polymerase to a termination-competent form). The results of this study will allow a clear distinction between these models.  %%%  The information for the synthesis of a protein is encoded in blocks of sequences of RNA interspersed within RNA sequences that have no clearly defined function.  A group of proteins are responsible for the excising the blocks of amino acid specifying sequences from the rest of the RNA, and joining them in a linear chain for delivery to the protein synthesizing complex. These studies involve an ultrastructural approach to visualize the separate steps of the process, and to identify intermediates as a means of confirming postulated mechanisms of processing the RNA.  A second objective is to use the same assay to determine how the RNA transcript is released from the end of a DNA gene sequence, and the role of different genetic signals on this process.  Genes will be ultrastructurally observed in an actively transcribed state to allow mechanistic information to be obtained on transcription mechanisms.  * * *",
