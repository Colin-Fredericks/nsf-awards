These new projects in medium  energy nuclear/particle physics are based in part on  fruitful collaborations during the past decade.  One of the  main efforts is the study of the quark structure of hadrons  and nuclei, which will give important insight into the  nature of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong  interactions.  This research will also include research on  nucleon-nucleon and nucleon-hyperon interactions based on  quark/gluon interactions.  The methods of QCD sum rules will  be used to help develop models consistent with QCD theory.  Another effort will be the study of the modifications of  hadronic properties and interactions in nuclear matter. This  research will include studies of nucleon nucleon scattering  in heavy ion collisions as well as the modification of  hadronic masses ans coupling constants.  The method of QCD  sum rules will also be used here when applicable.    This collaboration is supported under the U.S.-China  Cooperative Research Program.",
