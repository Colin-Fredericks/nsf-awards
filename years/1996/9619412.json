The panel is  composed of 19 Federal agencies that participate in 11 task  committees.  the task committees focus on specific issues,  e.g., earthquake and natural hazard reduction. passive and  active control systems, repair and retrofit of structures  and wind and earthquake engineering of offshore and retrofit  of structures task committee workshops and conferences are  shared at the annual joint meeting and usually published as  proceedings.",
