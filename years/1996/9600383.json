 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600383  Reynolds    This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr. William  Reynolds of the Department of Materials Science and  Engineering at Virginia Tech and Dr. Kazuhiro Hono of the  Computational Materials Science Division of the National  Research Institute for Metals (NRIM). Project funding will  enable Dr. Reynolds to spend one year in Japan, resident at  NRIM, in order to study the interfacial chemistry of  precipitates in metals using atom probe/field ion  microscopy.  Dr.  Reynolds has previously studied  thermodynamic and crystallographic aspects of phase  transformations in metals.  Dr. Hono has applied atom  probe/field ion microscopy to study the chemistry of  aluminum alloys, ferrous alloys, and magnetic materials at  the atomic scale.  Dr. Reynolds will combine his expertise  with that of Dr. Hono to study the influence of atomic-scale  chemistry on precipitate growth and  stability.    This proposal brings together research scientists from two  countries working in the area of physical metallurgy and  phase transformations.  The U.S. scientist will have the  opportunity to become familiar with research techniques,  equipment, and facilities at NRIM while contributing to the  overall research effort.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills  the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer  of scientific knowledge through an international  collaboration.  ***",
