 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this research is to investigate the effect  of the in vitro culture environment on the cultivation of cell-  polymer constructs in bioreactors.  Seeding mammalian cells onto  biodegradable polymer scaffolds and growing tissues on these  scaffolds in bioreactors represents a novel approach to tissue  regeneration.  Studies have shown that tissue growth and function  is affected by environmental forces.  In these studies, cell-  polymer constructs are cultivated in three bioreactors with  distinctly different fluid dynamic environments.  Measurements are  made using laser doppler and ultrasound doppler techniques to  characterize the fluid dynamic environment in each reactor.  These  measurements are correlated with structural and functional tissue  properties.  Results from these studies will increase our basic  understanding of tissue growth and function under various  hydrodynamic conditions and contribute to the optimization of  bioreactor systems for cultivation of clinically useful tissues.    The interactive activities include developing and teaching an  interactive tissue engineering course, coordinating a \"Brown Bag  Lunch\" Series for women and minority faculty and students,  coordinating an outreach program for K-12 students, and  participating as a Faculty Role Model/Mentor in student activities  administered by the New England Board of Higher Education.",
