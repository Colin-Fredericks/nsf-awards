Two types of measurements can be made on each item or individual   in a study: one of them, denoted by a vector x, is expensive, or time   consuming or sometimes even impossible to obtain, and a second measurement,   denoted by a vector y, is more easily obtained. A calibration curve  is constructed by fitting a statistical model that establishes the   relationship between y and x, based on data that is available on both of   these variables. The calibration curve is then used in a further study for   statistical inference concerning an unknown value of x after observing y.   This research involves the construction of confidence regions for the  unknown value of x. Different types of confidence regions are needed   depending on the application. If the calibration curve is used for   constructing a confidence region for a single unknown value of x, we have   a single use confidence region. On the other hand, if the calibration   curve is used to construct confidence regions for a sequence of unknown   values of x, corresponding to a sequence of measurements y, we have   multiple use confidence regions. Simultaneous confidence regions may   also be required when we have a given set of unknown values of x,   corresponding to a given set of independent y measurements. The   construction of such confidence regions will be investigated   under various assumptions on the  model that relates y and x.  %%%  Calibration is a widely used procedure in the chemical and engineering   sciences. Typical problems where calibration arises deal with the  measurement of the concentration of a chemical in a sample, or the amount of  drug in a serum sample, where the direct measurement of these quantities of  interest is usually difficult or expensive. An indirect response is usually  easy to obtain and once a relationship is established between the response and  the quantity of interest, this relationship can be us ed to estimate the  quantity of interest, when its value is unknown. This research is aimed at  obtaining an interval for the unknown quantity of interest. In particular, the  interval can be used to conclude, for example, if the unknown concentration   of the chemical exceeds a certain limit.   ***",
