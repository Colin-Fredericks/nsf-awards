 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines new language mechanisms for accessing  message invocations in message passing based concurrent  programming languages. Current mechanisms for invocation  selection control, including those that allow invocation  parameters to be examined, are not expressive enough. In  particular, they do not provide a simple and efficient way  to examine pending invocations of an operation or allow the  selection decision to be based on more than just a single  invocations parameters. Examining invocations and performing  cross-invocation or cross-operation selection are important  in a number of real applications, including debugging,  visualization, and scheduling algorithms.  Using current  mechanisms to solve these problems results in cumbersome and  inefficient code. This project involves a mix of conceptual,  design, implementation, and evaluation work. To make the  work concrete, the new language mechanisms are being defined  and implemented as extensions to the SR concurrent  programming language. The results of the qualitative and  quantitative evaluations are being used to refine the  semantics and implementations of the new language  mechanisms.  ***",
