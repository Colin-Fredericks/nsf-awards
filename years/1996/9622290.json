Cal-Berkeley            This project studies the recursively enumerable (re) sets of  integers, in a way which is independent of their enumeration and  independent of how integers are viewed as coding information. It is  the study of re sets purely in relation to each other. The main  ingredients of this study are: automorphisms of the collection of re  sets - the symmetries that exist among re sets; and invariant sets -  the walls that prevent symmetries. These two ingredients naturally go  hand-in-hand.  The main method used in this field is called `priority  arguments'. This is a technique for performing computable  constructions that ensure appropriate non-computable properties. A  current guiding problem is: if an invariant set has non-trivial  minimum information content then each of its members must have maximum  information content. It is known that settling this would involve an  extension of current automorphism techniques.             A set is \"re\" (recursively enumerable) if it can be  computably listed. For example, the set of all possible theorems of  mathematics (deduced from the usual axioms) is re. This project  studies the re sets themselves. Penrose, in his book The Emperor's New  Mind, suggests an analogy between computing and consciousness. This  projects seeks possibilities in the more strained analogy between re  sets (independent of their enumeration) and the timeless aspects of  consciousness. There are existing results which can be seen as  indicative of this direction. The main method used in this field is  called \"priority arguments\". This is a method whereby a common purpose  can be achieved by establishing an extensive field of \"world views\",  all working towards the common goal in their own separate ways, most  of which are conflicting. One interesting feature of the method is  that all reasonable world views must be allowed, including those that  deny the common purpose (those world views do their jobs by working  towards their own ne gations). Success in this project would strengthen  the potentially profound implications of the analogy linking  consciousness with a priority argument -like universe.",
