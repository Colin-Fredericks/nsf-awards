The  goal  is  to  increase  our  understanding of the interactions and properties which give  rise  to  the equilibrium structures of atoms at surfaces. The approach  is  to  determine the structures, the vibrational amplitudes  and  their  temperature  dependence in commensurate  structures  using  dynamical  LEED. The effects of defects such as  steps  on  these  overlayers  will also be investigated, and new LEED calculational  techniques  will  be  developed for these systems.  Additionally,  studies  will  be  made  in  order  to  understand  the  role  of  corrugation in the rotational epitaxy of incommensurate layers .  %%%  This  research program involves the study of the structures which  form when simple atoms such as potassium or xenon are adsorbed on  metal surfaces such as silver or copper. Their structures will be  determined by using the diffraction of electrons or helium atoms.  When  simple atoms are adsorbed on surfaces, the structures which  form  may have the same periodicity as the surface on which  they  are  adsorbed,  or  a different periodicity.  By  measuring  this  periodicity,  we obtain information on how these  atoms  interact  with the surface. Such fundamental interactions of adsorbed atoms  are interesting and useful for reasons as diverse as learning how  to  build  better  computer chips to inventing an  instrument  to  measure surface tension.  ***",
