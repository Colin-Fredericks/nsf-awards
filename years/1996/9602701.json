 "awd_abstract_narration": "Occidental College, located in the northeastern sector of Los Angeles, is a private college of the liberal arts and sciences.  The College has received national recognition for sustaining its traditional commitment to high achievement while embracing the changes necessary to serve an increasingly diverse community.  This is evident by its science programs that highly emphasize both research and student development.  Occidental has recognized the need to integrate scientific research and education programs, and has made a commitment to provide the programs in Physics, Geology, and Environmental Sciences with new laboratories. Active research programs include the following areas:  plasma physics, low temperature physics, atomic physics, laser physics, structural geology, mineralogy, paleomagnetism, paleontology, geochemistry, and environmental analysis. Currently these programs are housed in Fowler Hall, a structure that was built in 1931. The building's original utilities are inadequate to support the research programs of 10 faculty members and 44 students.  The facility does not comply with ADA regulations and is in need of seismic upgrading.  However, despite poor facilities, the department is able to maintain a high level of productivity.    As the third part of a four phase program, funding from the National Science Foundation  will be used to replace laboratories in Fowler Hall.  All existing conditions impeding research will be corrected with the construction of the new building. Upon completion, this project will increase student participation in the research activities of their professors earlier in their undergraduate careers.  The new structure will provide equipment and facilities for students and faculty to do more varied and more extensive experimentation in all three disciplines. Thus faculty research will be expanded, research training and education will be improved, and students will be better prepared for professional and civic leadership.",
