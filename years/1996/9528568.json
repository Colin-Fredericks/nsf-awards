 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Bruce E. Bursten, Department of Chemistry, Ohio State University, is   supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of   the Chemistry Division for experimental and theoretical studies of the   photochemistry of dinuclear organometallic compounds (DOC). The project   aims at defining the photochemistry of this class of complexes and   involves exploratory photochemistry, spectroscopic investigations of the   intermediates formed during the photochemical reactions, and theoretical   studies of DOC complexes and photochemically generated DOC intermediates.   The compounds chosen for study contain two metal atoms bonded to one   another through small organic groups. These complexes will allow an   exploration of the competition between metal-metal and metal-ligand bond   breaking reactions, of the chemistry that can occur at two metal centers,   and of a wide variety of metal-ligand bonding modes.  When a chemical compound is exposed to light it is often activated and   undergoes what are termed photochemical reactions. Exceedingly important   examples include photosynthesis and the chemistry of vision. The   photochemical properties of organic compounds are well documented and   understood. In contrast, detailed knowledge of the factors that control   inorganic photochemistry has not yet emerged. The detailed investigations   to be carried   out in this study are designed to help fill this void and   will ultimately allow DOC compounds to be tailored for specific   photochemical activity.",
