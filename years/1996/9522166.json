The study consists of  several major tasks.  After a review of both the current  component-oriented methodology and the applications of system  reliability concepts in bridge evaluation and design, an  objective and practical system-oriented reliability-based  methodology will be proposed.  In this regard, both  serviceability and ultimate limit states will be considered  based on the Load and Resistance Factor Design method.  Using  the incremental loading fault-tree strategy, system factor  modifiers will be introduced in both bridge evaluation and  design to account for the presence and interaction of  individual components in the bridge system.  In this manner,  the full potential of system reliability concepts to the  advancement of bridge evaluation and design processes will be  realized.  A data base consisting of at least forty-three  highway bridges located in the U.S. in thirteen different  states will be used to demonstrate and validate the  applicability of the proposed methodology.  The end result  will have a significant impact on improving the management of  the reliability of our highway bridge infrastructure.  In  fact, the proposed bridge system reliability methodology will  greatly assist engineers in making more rational decisions  with respect to both safety and economy in evaluating and  designing highway bridges.***",
