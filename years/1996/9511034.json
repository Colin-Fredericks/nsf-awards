Yet despite the rapid  development of Sino-Tibetan studies in recent decades, they  remain poorly understood; indeed, some branches of the family are  still virtually unstudied. To fill this vacuum in historical  linguistic research, the STEDT (Sino-Tibetan Etymological  Dictionary and Thesaurus) project gatheres data from both extant  published works and the growing body of field work and  intergrates them into a coherent whole. The concrete goal of the  project is the publication of an etymological dictionary of the  ancestor language, Proto-Sino-Tibetan (PST), spoken perhaps  6000 years ago. The Dictionary is organized by semantic fields,  so it will constitute a \"thesaurus\" of PST.        A large computer database of etymological and lexicographic  information has been created to support the research required to  publish the Dictionary. This database consists of a lexical file  (containing at this time over l90,000 words in about 200  languages and dialects), an etyma file (containing over 2,400  reconstructions), and ancillary files containing references to  language names, bibliographic citations, extensive etymological  notes, and semantic diagrams. Sources for lexical data range from  published dictionaries and wordlists to questionnaires solicited  from fleld researchers. Along with the Dictionary, electronic and  hardcopy versions of materials supporting the reconstructions  will be published, including a directory of language names, a  compendium of phonological inventories, and detailed sound  correspondences in the form of a \"sound law database.\"",
