 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9513864  Fewtrell      This proposal is to study the role of calcium in stimulus-response coupling in non-excitable cells.  Both the amplitude of the calcium signal and its frequency of calcium oscillations have been found to be important, as well as additional signals like protein kinase C.  In this proposal the temporal relation between changes in intracellular calcium and secretion will be studied in single cells using a mucosal mast cell line.  Intracellular calcium will be measured by indo-1 photometry, and the secretion of individual serotonin-containing granules will be measured simultaneously in the same cell by constant potential amperometry.  This will determine the calcium response associated with a burst of secretion.  Fluorescence imaging will be used to monitor the calcium responses of a number of cells  simultaneously.  These calcium responses will be measured in response to a number of different stimuli.  %%%    This project will examine the role of calcium in the secretory response of mast cells to specific effectors, which is a type of stimulus response coupling, that occurs in many physiological responses.  ***",
