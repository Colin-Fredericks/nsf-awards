 "awd_abstract_narration": "9523729   Mitin  The development of new principles of optoelectronic device operation is a  problem of great importance for modern optoelectronic integrated circuits,  optical computing and optical communication systems. III-V direct band gap  PnpN thyristor-like structures are currently used as efficient  light-triggerable power devices, optical amplifiers, dynamic optoelectronic  memories, and two- and three-terminal optoelectronic switches. Progress in  fabrication technology has led to a significant improvement of the  parameters of thyristor-like devices, which in turn has led to new  optoelectronic applications. Our proposed use of the intermediate  incomplete turn-off regime constitutes a new principle, which can  essentially extend functional capabilities of these potentially key  components of optoelectronic computing and optical-fiber communication  systems.  The proposed research is aimed at utilizing the incomplete  turn-off regime of gate controlled light-emitting and lasing thyristors for  modulation of light intensity and switching purposes. In this regime a part  of the middle p-n junction is reverse biased and blocks the current, while  the remaining part of the structure is highly conducting and  light-emitting. The size of the light-emitting area and the light intensity  in this region can be controlled using small gate signals. Moreover, gates  make it possible to control the position of the light emitting region.  These features allow decreased switching times of optoelectronic switches  and the creation of new types of optical devices for the high-frequency  modulation of emission intensity and logic circuits. In the proposed regime  of operation the mechanism of carrier removal is based solely on the  effects of the electric field, and is completely free of recombination  lifetime limitations, which define the speed of conventional operation  regimes.  The goal of this project is to develop a new type of  multifunctional optoelectronic device. The research will be based on  a  computer simulation of gate-controlled light-emitting devices and lasers.  Simulation of stationary and nonstationary squeezing of electron-hole  plasma in partially turned-off optothyristors will be carried out, to  investigate squeezing effects on the parameters of light radiation. Optimum  conditions for effective control of light power and decreasing of switching  times will be determined.  ***",
