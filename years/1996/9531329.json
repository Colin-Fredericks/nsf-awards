 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of nine  undergraduate students in the 12 week REU Sites program at  Harvard Forest.  Since 1985 the Harvard Forest has conducted  an exciting Summer Research program in Ecology dedicated to  providing undergraduate students with independent research  experience and to promoting career development in ecology.  This very effective program consists of advertisement and  recruitment; selection of diverse and productive students;  advance preparation; individual mentorship within research  groups comprised of faculty, graduate students, and  postdoctoral fellows; weekly seminars and discussion groups  on science, careers, graduate studies, and ethics; field  trips and recreational opportunities; an annual student  symposium; program questionnaire and discussion; and follow-  up including publication, professional presentation, and  thesis development. The Harvard Forest is the base for an  NSF-Long term Ecological Research Program, DOE-National  Institutes of Global Change Program, and related studies  involving 75 researchers.  The central research theme is the  comparison of natural disturbance with recent direct (e.g.  land-use) and indirect (e.g. Chemical and climatic) human  impacts, in terms of forest structure and function.  The  Harvard Forest is exceptionally well-equipped with field,  laboratory, and housing facilities for an REU Sites program.  Students are supervised in their independent study by a  mentor and the program is coordinated by Harvard Forest  staff, including the Director, Administrator, Forest  Manager, Museum Coordinator, Computer Manager, and Data  Manager.  Participants are recruited with a strong emphasis  on geographic coverage and participation of women,  minorities, and small colleges.       This award will foster the continued education and  training of individuals who will be part of the next  generation of basic researchers in the forest ecology.  It  will also help to produce citizens informed about various  aspect s of environmental sciences and management and  decision making in environmental issues.",
