The program will consist of two and a half days of formal sessions and three informal evening discussion periods.  The first evening session will be rather informal, except for a keynote speech describing the international picture of biothermal engineering.  The first full day will consist of six tutorial sessions on the fundamentals as well as the current state of the art of various biothermal phenomena from biological, medical, and engineering viewpoints.  Each  of these sessions will consist of a lecture followed by a discussion period.  In the evenings, following both full day sessions, individual group discussions will be held on the topics of the day.  The morning of the second full day will be devoted to sub-group discussions of application areas.  In the afternoon of the second full day a plenary session will be held to identify the major issues for the following discussion sessions.  The sessions of the third evening will also be used to develop reports on the individual topics discussed.  During the final morning,  plenary session will be held in which individual reports will be presented, discussed, and finalized for inclusion in the final report.    The final report of the workshop will consist of a summary of the discussions and conclusions regarding current status and future work.  It will also be presented at various scientific and technical meetings to serve as a guide to the researchers, sponsoring agencies, and industry dealing with biothermal engineering.  The report will also contain summaries of the keynote addresses and a listing of all the participants together with abstracts of their current research interests.  ***",
