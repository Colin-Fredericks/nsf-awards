 "awd_abstract_narration": "Baumslag  9626231    The investigator and his colleagues develop software to study  finitely presented groups.  Many problems that arise in diverse  mathematical disciplines can be distilled into related problems  about finitely presented groups.  One of the major developments  of the decade beginning in the mid 1950s has been the proof that  almost all questions about such finitely presented groups are  algorithmically undecidable.  Nevertheless, the very importance  of these groups makes it essential to try to obtain at least  partial information about them.  In particular, although problems  about finitely presented groups are unsolvable in general, it may  be possible in a number of specific instances to solve such  problems.  In order to gain some insight into these problems, it  is often necessary to try to carry out some experiments and  computations with finitely presented groups.  Such experiments  and computations are very time-consuming and usually  impossible to carry out by hand.  This project aims to make such  experiments and computations possible by using very fast  computers. enabling one to gather enough information together  about many important problems to facilitate their solution.  The  project creates and implements a package of group-theoretical  algorithms and procedures, which can be run by means of a  graphical user interface and which is easily accessible by a  widevariety of users.    Groups are mathematical entities that encapsulate, among other  things, the intrinsic meaning of symmetry.  This explains,in  part, why they turn out to be a very important tool in physics,  chemistry, biology and other mathematical disciplines.  The  understanding of these \"groups\" provide insight into these  disciplines, as well as a means for studying them.  For example,  groups play an essential role in quantum mechanics and particle  physics and they also provide a means for studying the space  people live in.  Many of these groups have seemingly simple  descriptions, even though t hey themselves can be very  complicated.  This complexity helps to explain why, for example,  certain important parts of chemistry and biology are so  difficult.  They also give rise to new problems and provide for  solutions to problems in theoretical computer science,  cryptography and other fields.  Their ubiquitousness and  usefulness make the creation of a software package that will lead  to a deeper understanding of many of them an extremely important  enterprise.",
