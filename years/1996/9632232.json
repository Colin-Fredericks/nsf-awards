 "awd_abstract_narration": "Masten  9632232    This is an award to support research on a recirculating treatment  system using ozone for improving the biodegradability of  disinfection byproducts and precursors from water containing  natural organic matter.  The project's research objectives are to  obtain an understanding of how organic materials in natural  waters are modified during the application of ozone and the  response of biological systems to products of this ozonation  process.  This knowledge will be utilized in  development of  mathematical models that can be used to predict removal of the  target substances from water by the use of the recirculating  system proposed for study in this project.  The parameters to be  monitored in evaluation of the system to be studied include total  organic carbon, ultraviolet absorbance, alkalinity, assimilable  organic carbon, trihalomethanes, haloacetic acid formation  potential, heavy metals, bromide ion and specific organic  compounds.    This project addresses a need for determining how to deal with  the presence of naturally occurring organic materials in water  that combine with chlorine when used as a disinfectant to produce  undesirable compounds of carcinogenic significance.  Results of  this project are expected to lead to mathematical models that can  be utilized in the engineering design of systems to address this  problem.  The research being conducted involves identification of  relationships between products of the ozonation process, the  biodegradability of those products and the potential for the  formation of trihalomethanes and other chlorinated compounds  during subsequent chlorination to disinfect the treated water.",
