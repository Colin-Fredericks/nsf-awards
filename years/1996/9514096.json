This developmental process involves the coordination of both differentiation and cell division. Exogenous application of the plant growth hormone indole-3 acetic acid (IAA) induces cell division in the cells that give rise to lateral roots and therefore increases the number of lateral roots. The long term goal of this work is to define the developmental pathway or lateral root formation and understand how IAA regulates that pathway. Previously, three Arabiodopsis mutations were discovered that cause aberrant lateral root formation (alf). Briefly, the alf1-1 mutation causes a hyperproliferation of lateral roots presumably due to excess IAA, the alf4-1 mutation fails to make lateral roots and is insensitive to IAA, and the alf3-1 mutant initiates lateral roots but the lateral roots fail to mature and die. Surprisingly, IAA rescues the alf3-1 mutant. The first objective of this proposal is directed at cloning and characterizing the ALF4 gene product. The  ALF4 gene will  be cloned using a map based approach as well as a transposon tagging scheme. The gene has been mapped in relation to the Arabidopsis physical map and flanking markers have been identified. in addition, DS elements capable of excision and reinsertion have been mapped to locations near the genes. Once the gene is cloned, its predicted protein sequence will be compared to sequence databases. From this information experiments will be designed to determine the biochemical function of the gene product. These experiment will include analysis of the temporal and spatial expression patterns of the gene, determination of the intracellular location of the protein, and expression in heterologous systems directed at assaying biochemical function. New mutants defective in lateral root formation will also be isolated as well as the identification of new mutant alleles of ALF3 and ALF4. Mutants will be screened for in populations mutagenized with different mutagens and derived from different ecotypes. ***                         ;                               S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Oh     +'  0                                       $       H       l                                               D       h                                                   R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       9514096                             eozsaruh                            eozsaruh                    @     ?W                            @                                   @     ?W                                                                                                     @    F #                                    Microsoft Word 6.0                                                      2                                                                                       ;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         e =       e               J                       J                                       j       j   j       j       j       j       j                                                                       N   1                                                                                                                   0           T       +   N                       j                                                                         N               j       j                                                                       j               j                                       ~               j       j       j       j                           H                                                                                                   9514096 Celenza  The primary way in which plants increase the size of their root system is by lateral, or secondary, root formation.
