 "awd_abstract_narration": "9624050  Hemley    The behavior of solid hydrogen and related molecular systems  will  be  investigated  with  newly  developed  experimental  techniques   to  pressures  in  excess  of   300   GPa   and  temperatures  down  to  2 K.  Both recently  discovered  and  theoretically predicted novel transitions in these materials  will  be  examined, including metallization at  the  highest  pressures.  The experiments will be conducted with  diamond-  anvil  cells  used  in  conjunction with  synchrotron  x-ray  diffraction and synchrotron infrared, Raman, Brillouin,  and  optical  spectroscopic  methods.  The  diamond  anvils  will  include high-strength, high-purity synthetic crystals.   The  experiments will probe the crystal structures, orientational  states,   phase   diagrams,   and   vibrational   electronic  properties  of the high-pressure molecular and non-molecular  states.   The  high-pressure behavior  of  newly  discovered  stoichiometric hydrogen compounds will also be investigated,  and  new  techniques for exploring matter  at  still  higher  pressures  will be developed.  The results of  this  project  will  provide  critical  tests of  fundamental  theories  of  condensed  matter  physics, will aid in the  design  of  new  materials,  and  will provide important information  on  the  interiors of the large planets.  %%%  Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the cosmos and  the  key  to a wide range of fundamental problems in the physical  sciences.  At low temperatures and under moderate pressures,  the material crystallizes as a diatomic molecular solid.  At  sufficiently  high  pressures, however,  the  molecules  are  predicted  to break down to form an atomic metal with  novel  and   potentially  important  properties   such   as   high-  temperature  superconductivity.  At high temperatures,  this  material in the fluid state is the major constituent of  the  large gaseous planets, and at still higher temperatures,  of  stars.   Information  on  the behavior  of  hydroge n  as  it  evolves  towards these novel states requires detailed  study  with  high-pressure techniques.  Resent advances in diamond-  anvil  cell  techniques  have  permitted  materials  to   be  compressed and studied to pressures in excess of 300 GPa  (3  Mbar   or   three  million  atmospheres  pressure).    These  techniques  will  be used together with x-ray  and  infrared  radiation   from   high-energy   electron   storage   rings,  synchrotrons, laser techniques, and other optical methods to  probe  the nature of hydrogen and related substances in  the  newly  accessible range of pressures.  The  results  of  the  work will provide critical tests of fundamental theories  of  condensed  matter  physics, will aid in the  design  of  new  materials,  and  will provide important information  on  the  interiors of the large planets.  ***",
