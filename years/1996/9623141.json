 "awd_abstract_narration": "Srinivasan  9623141    This proposal supports the work of Professor H. Srinivasan to  work on problems in commutative algebra.  She intends to study  the multiplicity of R/I for a homogeneous ideal I in terms of the  shifts in its minimal graded resolution.  She also intends to  study the finite determinations of the presentations of an ideal.  Finally, she intends to construct the minimal algebra resolutions  for R/I where I is an ideal in the linkage class of a complete  resolution.     This research is on the boundary between commutative algebra and  algebraic geometry.  Both fields arose from the classical problem  of studying mathematical objects defined in the plane by the  simplest of equations, namely polynomials.  Today, the fields use  methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and  topology, and conversely are extensively used in those fields.   Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse as  physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding  theory and robotics.",
