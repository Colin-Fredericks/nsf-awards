 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on computation, optimization, singularity and vibration  analysis of polygonal elastic thin plates. The following studies will be carried out:   (a) the analysis of singular behavior of polygonal thin plates near corners; (b) the  study of corner effects in boundary value problems for polygonal thin plates, and  associated numerical computations; (c) vibration and stabilization analysis of  polygonal thin plates; and (d) optimal boundary control for polygonal thin plates  with point sensors at corners.  The research utilizes layer potential techniques  for solutions of boundary value problems on Lipschitz domains, weighted  Sobolev spaces, microlocal Fourier analysis and boundary element methods.  %%%  Elastic thin plates of polygonal shape occur naturally in structural mechanics.  The presence of corners may result in corner effects such as singularities in  surface stresses and displacements, and the absence of certain modes of  vibration.  Such considerations are of great concern in the design and  manufacture of various mechanical systems and structures. For example, due  to singularities in stress concentrations at corners, repeated loading may cause  fatigue which can shorten the service life of certain structural components such  as those found in many aircraft.  This makes understanding, quantifying, and  controlling the behavior of singularities at corners of thin plates imperative.  This  research will build such a theoretical foundation as well as demonstrate through  numerical simulations the singular phenomena that can occur and how it may be  controlled.",
