 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prior research on multiprocessor interconnection networks has primarily focused  on the network topology, switching mechanism, and message routing algorithm to   maximize network performance. Very little work has been done to study the impact  of the communication properties of parallel applications.  Communication pattern,  message generation frequency, and  message size are the three attributes to  quantify any communication. The proposed research is aimed at characterizing  these communication workloads and analyzing their impact on multiprocessor  performance.    The research has two major phases. In the first phase, traffic profiling of a  wide range of parallel applications will be conducted by collecting execution  traces from parallel machines and also from an execution-driven simulator. The  communication traces will be analyzed to determine  different types of traffic  patterns, rate of communication, and  volume of communication. The second phase  of the project will use these realistic traffic properties for the performance  analysis of interconnection networks via simulation and analytic models. In-depth  simulation of known unicast and collective  routing algorithms on various  topologies  will be performed with these workloads. Analytical models capturing  wormhole  switching, virtual channel flow control, routing mechanism and the   realistic workloads will be developed. The main contribution of the project is  characterizing application workloads to be used for different architectural and  algorithmic research. For example, evaluation with these workloads will quantify  the actual performance advantages of adaptive  routing algorithms, will identify  the potential bottlenecks of existing communication mechanisms, and will provide  insight for developing application-specific routing algorithms.  Next, the new  mathematical tools will be more accurate in predicting the realistic  communication traffic. The techniques and tools developed in this research can  be used in understandi ng and evaluating the interplay between parallel  architectures and algorithms to maximize the performance of existing machines and  to design better machines in the future.",
