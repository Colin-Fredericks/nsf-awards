 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI:  Jenson  IBN:  9634409      The development of mathematical and numerical models plays a vital role   in summarizing, interpreting and disseminating neuroscience data for the  form and function of the nervous system. These modeling efforts attempt to   describe neurophysiological processes at every level of description from the   conformational changes of single  ion-channel  proteins, to the electrical   properties of  the dendrites and axons of single neurons, to the data   processing of large-scale neural networks. Two key features of these  various levels of description are that these processes are dynamic   and the interaction within and between levels is nonlinear due to a  wide variety of feedback mechanisms. Recent mathematical and numerical   methods for analyzing such nonlinear dynamical systems offers great   promise for studying the models for these neurophysiological processes-   not only to provide new ways to organize and understand experimental   data in the neurosciences but most importantly to suggest new  ways of looking at complex phenomena and to suggest new experiments.   To this end the purpose of this proposal is to develop and strengthen  a research collaboration that integrates the new theoretical and numerical   tools of nonlinear dynamical systems with state of the art experimental   measurments of neurophysiological processes.  The proposed collaboration   combines the talents and resources of a theoretical physicist with specific   expertise in nonlinear dynamics,  Prof. R.V. Jensen at Wesleyan University,   with an outstanding group of neuroscientists headed by Prof. G.M. Shepherd at   Yale University.",
