 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental problem in parallel computing is to design  high-level, architecture independent, algorithms that  execute efficiently on general purpose parallel machines.  The purpose of this project is to advance our understanding  of the main factors required for designing practical  parallel algorithms and to develop techniques and data sets  for experimentally validating the results. As a byproduct,  portable parallel programs and data sets for a number of  specific important problems arising in combinatorial  computing and image processing will be developed and made  available to other researchers through the PI's Web page.  There are currently two factors that make this fundamental  problem more tractable. The first is the convergence of  parallel architectures toward a unifying model and the  second is the emergence of standards such as the message  passing standard MPI. The technical approach to be followed  is based on (1) a simple computation model that incorporates  communication costs into the complexity of the algorithms,  and (2) a SPMD programming model that makes effective use of  communication primitives.  ***",
