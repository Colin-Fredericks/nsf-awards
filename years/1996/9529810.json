The   objectives of the meeting are:  to promote greater collaboration and flow of   information and expertise among the members of the IAI Regional Center; to   constitute a scientific forum where critical discussions abut the   achievements in joint scientific projects can be held; to encourage   participation of individuals at all levels in multinational projects in the   field of climate variability; and to promote educational and training   activities in the field of climate change.  Meteorological and   climatological data bases for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean will   also be compiled.  Preliminary versions of these data bases will be   distributed among members of the Research Center to prepare stud ies aimed at   proposal preparation for joint work.  The proposed Regional Center would be composed of a group of research   institutions which share their resources for the study of particular   problems.  The Regional Center would also be a forum in which critical   discussions of the collaborative studies could be held, and it would   promote scientific excellence.  The collaborative projects of this proposed   Regional Center would enhance the interest in studying various aspects of   climate change and would educate new generations of scientists.  The   results of these projects would be made available to other scientists   studying cross-cutting issues such as human dimensions of climate change   and training and education.  %%%  This proposal will organize a group of scientists from Mexico, the United   States, Central America, and the Caribbean with the main objective of   bringing together, into an Inter-American Institute (IAI) Regional Center,   members of these scientific communities with a common interests in the  study of the IAI scientific theme \"El Ni=F1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and   Interannual Climate Variability,\" as well as in the theme   \"Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Interactions in the Intertropical Americas.\"   Specifically, the objectives of the Regional Center will be achieved  through periodic meetings during which members of the group will inform,   discuss and examine in a critical manner their work within the framework of   the IAI Science Agenda.  The objectives of the meeting agenda are: to   promote grater collaboration and flow of information and expertise among   the members of the IAI Regional Center; to constitute a scientific forum   where critical discussions abut the achievements in joint scientific   projects can be held; to encourage participation of individuals at all   levels in multinational projects in the field of climate variability; and   to promote educational and training activities in the field of Climate   Change.  There is also a plan for the cr eation of a meteorological and   climatological data bases for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.   Preliminary versions of these data bases will be distributed among members   of the Center to prepare studies aimed at proposal preparation for joint   work.  ENSO and other climatic events involve interactions between the ocean and   atmosphere.  The signal of ENSO on Mexican climate also relates to   interactions with land, on local and on regional scales.  It has not been   until the last decade that some physical mechanisms associated with the   summer rainy season over Mexico have been identified.  For example, cold sea   surface temperature anomalies along the equatorial eastern Pacific seem to   lead to a strengthening of moisture convergence along the western coast of   Mexico and to an enhanced rainy season over the Mexican western coast. Most   of the climatic processes that affect Mexico are not geographically unique.  The richness of the climatic phenomena in Mexico, Central America and the   Caribbean has not been examined in as much detail as its mid-latitude or   tropical western Pacific counterparts.  This is due in part to the small   number of atmospheric scientists in the region, their traditional and   empirical approaches used to study meteorology and climate in the   operational centers, along with often incomplete databases.  In addition,   inter-institutional collaboration in studying climate has been meager.  A   potential solution for these problems is cooperation through this proposed   Regional Center for the study of El Ni=F1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and   Internal Climate Variability, as well as Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Interactions   in the Intertropical Americas.  The following countries are participating   in this proposal:  Costa Rica; Cuba; Mexico; Panama; and the United States.   These countries are Members States of the IAI, a U.S. initiative to   stimulate cooperative research on global change issues among the scientific   institutions of the Americas .  The U.S. National Science Foundation is the   U.S. Government agency designated to carry out U.S. responsibilities within   the IAI.  ***        --========================_13293532==_--",
