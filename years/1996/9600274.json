Dr. Curtin will work with Dr. Eiichi Bannai, professor in  the Department of Mathematics, on a research project  entitled \"Some Problems of Algebraic Combinatorics.\"    The proposed research will examine association schemes using  subsonstituent algebra and focusing on connections among the  thin condition, the Q-polynomial property, the 2-homogeneous  condition, and spin models. The focus of the research will  be on spin models, association schemes, and their  connections.  Spin models arose in the study of knots and  links.  It has recently been shown that any spin model is  contained in an association scheme.  In almost every case,  the scheme involved satisfies two conditions -- the thin  condition and the Q-polynomial condition.  Drs. Bannai and  Curtin propose to study schemes with both properties from  the perspective of the subconstituent algebra, their goal  being to determine which of these schemes contain spin  models.  Spin models have recently received a great deal of  attention among researchers at Kyushu University, but until  now have not been studied from the perspective of the  subconstituent algebra. As association schemes provide the  basic framework in the development of codes and designs,  research into these basic models will likely result in  practical benefits beyond initial theoretical explorations.  ***",
