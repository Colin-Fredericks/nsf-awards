 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research explores visualization methods for examining  high-dimensional data with low-dimensional projections with CAVE  Virtual Reality technology. Dynamic graphical methods for  exploratory  data analysis are examined in a 3-d immersible environment. The  methods are based on generating motion graphics from continuous  sequences of 3-d projections of high-dimensional data.  Interactive  user control is considered in the form of controlling the path of  the  3-d sequences in the data space.     Virtual Reality offers the construction and realization of an  artificial 3-dimensional world that has important potential use  in  scientific areas. Statistics is the science of making sense of  complicated data. For example, typical environmental data sets  may  contain thousands of data values on hundreds of variables.  Graphical  methods are needed for exploring and determining relationships  among  variables such as tree crown health, topography, temperature,  population density and atmospheric pollutants. This research  explores  statistical graphical methods for visualizing many variables  simultaneously using CAVE Virtual Reality technology. The  research  relates to the Federal Strategic Area of Improved Environmental  Quality in that the examined methods can provide insights for  examining spatially measured environmental data. It also relates  to  the Federal Strategic Area of Harnessing Information Technology  because it examines using Virtual Reality technology for  organizing  and synthesizing information.",
