 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a joint effort with Deborah Estrin, University of Southern  California under award NCR-9628729.    Many applications require reliable multipoint data delivery.  Some well  known examples are netnews, electronic mailing list, and network routing  protocols such as BGP.  Up until now, however, due to the lack of widely  available support for both IP multicast and reliable multicast transport,  these applications have been using multiple TCP connections to achieve  reliable data delivery to multiple destinations, which results in both poor  scalability and inefficient utilization of network resources.    The goal of this research is to develop a framework and a set of mechanisms  to provide efficient, robust, scalable, and reliable multicast data  delivery both over very large networks and with very large multicast  groups. The basic principles that have guided the design include the  application level framing (ALF), the IP multicast group concept and  receiver-initiated group management, and the core design principles of  TCP/IP --- simple datagram service, the end-to-end approach to reliability,  and automatic adaptation to changing operational environment.    The research will (1) systematically investigate the scaling issues with  the proposed adaptive error recovery scheme; (2) develop mechanisms to  localize error recovery traffic and substantially reduce the recovery  overhead in the current design; (3) develop flow and congestion algorithms  for many-to-many multicast data delivery; and (4) investigate new models  for session message distribution to further improve the scalability.",
