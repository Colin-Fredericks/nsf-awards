 "awd_abstract_narration": "This renewal grant to Professor Ben S. Freiser at Purdue University is in   the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program and supports studies of   gas-phase metal containing cluster ion  reactions by mass spectrometric   techniques.  Supersonic and seed plasma sources will be used to generate   the clusters and the measurement step will involve Fourier transform ion   cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry.  Particular emphasis will be   placed on metal-carbon ion clusters, including metallo-carbohedrenes.    The objectives of the work include the accumulation of fundamental   information regarding the bonding and reactivity of these clusters, and   development of a new approach to synthesis of macroscopic amounts of the   materials.  Collaborative theoretical studies will augment the former and   additional collaborative work is involved in the synthesis   investigations. Both collaborations involve other research groups on the   Purdue campus.  Cluster compounds have only recently been discovered and much is not   known about their structure, bonding, and reactions.  This project is   focussed on obtaining just such information.  Using apparatus available   to the principal investigator which represents novel and/or unique   approaches, the materials can be generated and their reactions   subsequently studied by mass spectrometric techniques.  In addition, the   work may produce these materials in macroscopic amounts which would   greatly accelerate developments in the area.",
