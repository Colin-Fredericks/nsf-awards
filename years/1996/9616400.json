(PHI), Lafayette, Louisiana, as a result of NSF solicitation  OPP 95-029, \"Acquisition of Helicopter services for the  United States Antarctic Program and the New Zealand  Antarctic Program\".  This two year contract (plus 3 one year  option periods) is being awarded by the NSF to PHI, with  Office of Aircraft Services (OAS) under the Department of  Interior (DOI) providing administrative oversight per  amended MOA of 25 Sept., 1995.  As administrator for the  Helicopter Services contract, OAS will provide periodic  disbursement of funds to PHI for services rendered, in  accordance with the amended MOA, via NSF/OAS contract OPP 96-  43291.  This jacket, in the amount of $1.00 U.S., will serve  to identify the Helo Services contract (i.e., give it a NSF  contract number) and track it in the NSF awards system, and  will be managed by the Deputy Research Support Section,  Office of Polar Programs.    This $1.00 funding action is necessary to allow for the  process of transferring $4,910,837.00 from NSF to OAS, who  will make payments to PHI at billing intervals per the RFP  OPP 95029.  It's anticipated first payments to the  contractor will be required on/about 15 October, 1996.    The Program Manager has reviewed this request and recommends  it for funding.                                      Dwight D. Fisher                                Acting Section Head",
