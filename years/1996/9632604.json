The project will provide specific CGI enhancement for 776 teachers and instructional leaders.  In addition, all 1476 teachers of elementary mathematics will receive mathematics enhancement that has a CGI component.  This program consists of eight components that will ultimately impact student success in primary grades not only in Phoenix but in Tucson and Flagstaff.  They include the:   (1) development of a CGI leadership cadre who are knowledgeable about CGI and its classroom implementation,  (2) development of CGI courses and integration of CGI into the USI Academies,  (3) 100% of the USI teachers trained in CGI to insure aligned curriculum and instruction for K-4 children in eight elementary school districts,  (4) implementation of CGI with University of Arizona and Tucson teachers and Northern Arizona University and Flagstaff teachers and the establishment of local networks,  (5) alignment of the K-12 system with the university pre-service program in Tucson, Phoenix and  Flagstaff,  (6) alignment of philosophy and content for the mathematics methods courses across the state universities,  (7) alignment of mathematics methods courses and Mathematics for Elementary Teachers (MTE 180) from the Mathematics Department at ASU,  (8) networking with San Diego State University and University of California-Los Angeles CGI projects.",
