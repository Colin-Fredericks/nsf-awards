 "awd_abstract_narration": "Liebler    This award supports an investigation into a variety of  detailed research programs, including cyclic and non-abelian  difference sets, Williamson matrices, finite geometries from  special p-groups, cyclotomic association schemes and integral  Hecke algebras. Although each is of substantial interest in  its own right, further study of each of these topics will  also contribute to the broader goal of development of an  integral representation theory for association scheme-like  structures that can be used constructively. This investigation  is computation-intensive, relying heavily on the high-level  computer software packages. This award also supports guest  speakers at an interstate Algebraic Combinatorics Seminar. The  biweekly seminar benefits students and faculty from  universities  along the front range of Colorado and Wyoming.    This research is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of  the goals of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of  studying how discrete collections of objects can be arranged.  The behavior of discrete systems is extremely important to  modern communications. For example, the design of large networks,  such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of   algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of  objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research. The broad   goal of this research is to narrow the gap between the known   examples and theoretical limits on certain types of highly   symmetric discrete systems.",
