 "awd_abstract_narration": "HRD - 9628450  Hernandez  New Mexico State University    This project proposes to continue the operation of the RIMI  Laboratory for Logic and Databases, established in 1993 with  support from RIMI funds (HRD 9353271).  The laboratory supports an  environment where research activities in the areas of logic  programming and deductive databases can be carried out.  Under the  umbrella of this laboratory research on theoretical and practical  aspects of Query Optimization and Parallel Logic Programming will  be pursued.  Query Optimization deals with efficient processing of  database queries.  Research will be carried out on devising  techniques that may take data-dependencies into account to  transform a given database program into a more efficient one.   Parallel Logic Programming deals with implementation of systems  that can exploit parallelism from logic programs.  A system based  on Shared Paged Binding Arrays will be developed on a  multiprocessor to implicitly exploit or-parallelism and and-  parallelism present in logic programs.      One of the principal objectives of this laboratory is to attract,  retain, and help minority graduate students to obtain Master's and  Ph.D.s in Computer Science.  Enticing minorities to pursue graduate  studies, in particular Ph.D.s,  is extremely difficult.  However,  we believe that with our first-class research program and  facilities, in which minority students can participate and feel an  integral part of, this can be readily accomplished, as it has been  demonstrated by our success under the current RIMI grant that  allowed us to initially establish the laboratory.",
