 "awd_abstract_narration": "Morgan  9522612  In this project, improvements of the restarted GMRES method for  solving large nonsymmetric systems of linear equations will be  investigated.  The goal is to develop a method that is  competitive with short recurrence Lanczos methods such as QMR,  but maintains the desirable properties of GMRES.  These  properties include extraction of the minimum residual solution  from the subspace, generally steady convergence, and numerical  stability.  It is also desired to not significantly raise cost  per iteration and storage requirements.    The convergence of GMRES can be improved by including approximate  eigenvectors in the subspace.  Once these eigenvalues are  essentially deflated from the spectrum of the matrix, removing  even just a few small eigenvalues from the spectrum can  significantly improve the convergence.  In this project a new and  efficient way of including eigenvectors is proposed.  Sorensen's  implicit-QR Arnoldi method for eigenvalues is combined with an  interior eigenvalue version of Arnoldi.  The surprising result is  that the approximate eigenvectors become part of a new Krylov  subspace.  This Krylov subspace can be used with GMRES.  The  expense per iteration is even less than that of regular GMRES for  the case where matrix-vector products are expensive, and the  number of iterations needed is sometimes greatly reduced.    The resulting implicitly restarted GMRES method will be studied  and compared with other methods.  ***",
