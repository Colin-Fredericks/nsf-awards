The representatives agreed to proceed toward the formulation and dissemination of a document that would  1) describe the content and aims of evolutionary biology;  2) document some of its accomplishments, including its contributions to biological science in general and to social needs in areas such as health science, agriculture, and environmental science;  3) outline important future contributions of our science to the biological science and to social needs;  4) identify areas of particular challenge and opportunity;  and  5) suggest mechanisms by which such challenges and opportunities may be pursued.  This document would inform science administrators and other representatives of society of the role of evolutionary biology in the progress of basic biological science and its applications to social needs, and would identify promising areas of future work.  A working group of eighteen (18) scientists representing major disciplines in evolutionary biology has been established and will meet over the next two years to draft a working document to be presented to the memberships of their respective societies.  The workshop series will include a meeting of the working group to establish an outline for the document, a meeting of the working group to revise a draft document, and a meeting of the working group to incorporate input from the scientific societies.  The workshop series will be followed by publication and dissemination of the finished document.",
