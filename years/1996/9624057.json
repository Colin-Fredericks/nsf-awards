 "awd_abstract_narration": "Algebraic number theory concern the study of the fields obtained  by  adjoining an algebraic number to the field of rational  numbers. The Stark Conjectures postulate a deep connection  between special values of the analytically defined L-series of  such a number field and algebraic properties of the field. In  particular, these Conjectures predict that certain specific  elements of the complex numbers obtained from the L-series are  actually algebraic elements, the Stark units. In the case of a  relative abelian extension of number fields, the Conjectures  further predict that  these elements, which would be uniquely  defined by the analytic data up to a choice of a root of unity,  generate abelian extensions of the number field. The Stark  Conjectures are among the central questions in algebraic number  theory. This investigation is concerned with examining a number  of questions regarding these conjectures, continuing and  extending  prior work of the investigators.   This research falls  into the general mathematical field of Number Theory.  Number  theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole  numbers,  addressing such questions as those dealing with the  divisibility of one  whole number by another. It is among the  oldest branches of mathematics and  was pursued for many  centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within  the last  half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse   applications in areas such as data transmission and processing,  and  communication systems.",
