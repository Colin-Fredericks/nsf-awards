 "awd_abstract_narration": "9624614  Boothy  This is a CAREER Award.    The project will develop new repair techniques for historic  structures and will develop educational activities that will  cultivate a respect for historic buildings, structures, and civil  works, and an interest in their maintenance, repair, and  rehabilitation.  The teaching and research activities will adopt  a multidisciplinary perspective, including architectural history,  architectural history, architecture, civil/structural  engineering, and landscape architectural input.    The repair techniques to be studies involve the application of  new composite Fiber Reinforced Plastic (FRP) materials, and their  application to historic structures is considered a demanding test  bed for the more general use of FRP materials in the repair of  concrete, steel, and masonry structures.  The specific types of  structures to be included in the study are masonry and concrete  arch bridges, metal truss bridges, mid-20th century slab girder  and slab bridges, unreinforced load bearing masonry buildings,  and thin-shell reinforced concrete structures.   The specific  issue to be addressed for these building types include transverse  effects in filled arch bridges, load distribution and floor  system issues in truss bridges, the hazard of parapets and  cornices of URM buildings in Eastern locations in moderate  earthquakes, environmental damage to thin-shell concrete  structures.  The repair techniques to be studied include  replacement of critical elements with FRP materials, externally  bonded FRP sheet reinforcement, external unbonded FRP  reinforcement (banding), and chemical and mechanical prestressing  using FRP repair materials.  ***",
