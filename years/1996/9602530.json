 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Guam Marine Laboratory will expand and  upgrade the seawater system in support of the growing demand  for space to support research by both resident faculty and  students as well as visiting investigators.  Prior  facilities improvements have included an upgrade of the  seawater pumps, installation of a redundant system that  allowed  for pump maintenance and repairs without  interruption of seawater flow and the addition of a back-up  generator with an automatic transfer switch which has  enabled the system to run continuously during periods of  power outrage.  The dependability of the present seawater  system will enhance experimentation and increase use of the  laboratory facilities for manipulative experiments under  controlled conditions, and for longer term growth and  physiological studies.  With the recent completion of a  visitors housing facility there is also an increasing demand  for the use of the water tables by visiting researchers.  In  order to ensure the facility can meet the research needs of  both resident and visiting scientists, the University of  Guam Marine Laboratory will expand and upgrade the present  facilities.  The specific improvements include the seawater  intake, expansion of the outdoor enclosed space, addition of  more seawater tables and tanks, and addition of a back-up  well to allow continuous seawater availability during  tropical storms and typhoons.    The University of Guam Marine Laboratory supports the  research of eight full-time faculty, numerous graduate and  undergraduate students, as well as visiting investigators.  The research demands on the facility have increased due to  the addition of new faculty at the laboratory, the recent  establishment of collaborative programs between the Marine  Laboratory and the University of Hawaii and the University  of the Ryukyus (Okinawa, Japan), and the awareness of the  Marine Laboratory as a resource for coral reef research by  over 550 scientists who attended the 7th International Coral   Reef Symposium on Guam in June 1992.  The improvements to  the seawater system will allow the support of the increasing  number of visiting scientists that wish to conduct research  at the laboratory, which will in turn enhance the research  environment.",
