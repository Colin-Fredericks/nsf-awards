A wire electro-discharge  machining process, and high speed band saw systems, are  chosen as two examples of research projects. For the former,  a full vibration and stability analysis is carried out in a  multi-mode, three dimensional traveling wire model; the  effects of non-uniform thermal loads, caused by sparks, are  examined; the effects of multi-span coupling and span guide-  wheel coupling are considered; and the wire whirling problem  is studied in addition to a characterization of chaotic  response of the wire using fractal dimensions and Lyapunov  exponents. Similarly, in the case of high speed band saws,  the use of shape memory alloys embedded into the blade is  investigated to increase structural stiffness at high  temperatures. In the educational area, undergraduate and  graduate courses are developed in vibrations, acoustics,  aeroelasticity, and nonlinear dynamics; and undergraduate  students are encouraged to get involved in the PI's research  program.***",
