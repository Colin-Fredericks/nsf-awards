 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612237  Walsworth  The emerging technology of the magnetic resonance of laser-  polarized noble gases helium and xenon (3He and 129Xe) will be  used in a three year program of biomedical, geophysics, and  materials science investigations.    A multi-institutional and multidisciplinary investigation will be  conducted jointly by researchers at the Smithsonian Astrophysical  Observatory, Cambridge, Massachusetts and Brigham and Women's  Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.  A subaward will support  materials research at the  North Carolina State University,  Raleigh, North Carolina; another will provide support to Boston  University for biomedical engineering studies associated with the  project.    Potential biomedical applications include the characterization of  lipid membrane integrity (e.g. in the diagnosis of multiple  sclerosis); improved in vivo lung imaging (important for early  tumor detection); and better measurement of blood flow to tissue  (important for stroke and ischemia  diagnosis).  In geophysics  and materials science, magnetic resonance measurements of laser-  polarized noble gas may improve the understanding of the  connectivity of pores in rocks, the structure, evolution, and  theology of foams and emulsions; and the diffusion of gases  through liquid crystalline polymer films.    Specific aims of the proposed research using laser-polarized  noble gas magnetic resonance are: I) perform biomedical studies  of noble gas magnetic resonance imaging as a new tool for human  disease diagnosis and research; ii) investigate the connectivity  of pores in reservoir rocks; iii) investigate the structure and  evolution of model foams and emulsions; iv) investigate the  rheology of model foams and emulsions under stress or strain; v)  investigate defects in liquid crystalline polymer films; vi)  train graduate and undergraduate students as multidisciplinary  researchers; and, vii) develop a computer-simulation teaching  module for use by undergraduate and high school students to  investigate  how basic principles of physics are applied to lasers  and magnetic resonance to yield serendipitous applications in  biology, medicine, geology, and materials.  ***",
