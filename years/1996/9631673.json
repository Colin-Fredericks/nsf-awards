University of Washington  Title: High Resolution Paleomonsoon Records from Central China    The Loess Plateau of central China contains a nearly continuous  record of paleoenvironmental change spanning the last 2.5 million  years.  Studies over the past two decades have described and  attempted to date the long loess/paleosol sequence that mantles the  plateau, but only during the past several years has attention been  directed toward obtaining high-resolution time-series of the last  glacial/interglacial cycle in order to understand the factors that  influenced the East Asian Monsoon system during the late  Quaternary.  This award supports a paleoclimate investigation in  the climatically sensitive boundary zone between arid and semi-arid  climates of central China where the changing monsoon effects are  pronounced and well documented in sedimentary strata.  Sampling of  loess/paleosol profiles along the desert margin will help to assess  temporal and regional variations in winter monsoon strength during  the last glacial cycle and the Holocene.  Data derived from this  study also will be relevant to addressing problems of erosion,  decertification, natural resource exploitation, and agricultural  productivity in the densely inhabited transition zone between arid  and semi-humid climates.",
