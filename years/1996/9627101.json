 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research problem is to determine why transport in the region  between Hawaii and the California coast deviates substantially from  what would be expected from wind forcing alone (Sverdrup balance).   Possible reasons are significant errors in the wind stress field,  seasonal variations in the transport which are not resolved by the  measurements, forcing by surface heat fluxes, or strong ocean  fronts.  Several of these mechanisms are being examined using new  data available from earth-observing satellites, and comparisons  with two quite different methods of analyzing ocean dynamics:   hydrographic measurements and numerical modeling of ocean  circulation.  Satellite wind and sea surface height observations  are being assimilated into a simple circulation model to separate  the effects of Rossby waves, seasonal heating, and wind forcing.    Interactive activities include teaching a graduate course on ocean  data and models, a workshop on balancing career and family, and  another workshop on careers in science education.",
