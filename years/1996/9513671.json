 "awd_abstract_narration": "9513671  Milgram    Cells are composed of a number of separate membrane bound  structures.  Each of these structures carries out a specific  function, such as energy production, degradation of old and damaged  proteins, and intercellular communication.  The proper functioning  of the cell depends upon the ability of the cell to direct each of  its many thousands of proteins to the correct structure.  There are  many cells, including those in the brain and endocrine glands,  which synthesize small chemical messengers called peptides.  Once  these small proteins are released into the intercellular space they  find their way to target cells and bind to proteins imbedded in the  surface of the recipient cell and initiate signaling.  These  peptides are derived from larger protein precursors which are  packaged into packets for release called secretory granules.   However, the mechanisms whereby proteins and peptides are targeted  to secretory granules is unclear.  The present work investigates  the mechanisms used by proteins to insure their packaging in the  proper secretory granules and will determine whether the amino acid  sequences of the proteins contain information sufficient to direct  the proteins to the correct intracellular organelle.  This research  will provide a greater understanding of how peptides are made and  targeted to secretory granules in neuroendocrine cells.  In  addition, this work is essential for understanding how cells in all  organisms use chemical messengers for communication and has  applications to cell biologists beyond the neuroendocrine field.",
