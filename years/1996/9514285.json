 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514285  Murray         In vitro methods will be used to study gap junctions  and gene regulation following treatment of cells with  compounds known to influence junction expression and to  promote adrenal steroidogenesis.  Specially, the effect of  adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), and DbcAMP treatment and cAMP-  dependent protein kinase (pKA) activity on gap junction  expression will be studied.  Bovine and human adrenal  cortical cell lines and primary rat cultures of adult rat  adrenal cortical cells will be used.  Vectors containing  cDNA antisense directed against gap junction gene products  (Connexin 43, Cx43) will be introduced into cells to  determine the effect of gap junction expression inhibition.  Adrenal gland development in transgenic mice containing a  Cx43 knockout will be studied.  The effect of over  expression and inhibition of gap junctions on adrenal cell  function, will be studied.  Gap junction expression will be  characterized and localized with immunohistochemistry,  western blot and northern blot analysis.  Evidence of cell  communication will be obtained with Lucifer yellow dye  transfer experiments.  Studies on the role of pKA and gap  junction expression will increase the knowledge of how gap  junctions function in endocrine cell response.  ***",
