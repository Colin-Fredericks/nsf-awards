 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project completes the implementation, already  underway, of the ViC* compiler and run-time system. The  compiler translates the data-parallel language C* with some  data explicitly declared to be \"out of core.\" Out-of-core  data reside on a parallel disk system. The compiler produces  C for a distributed-memory multiprocessor. It adds I/O and  library calls to access data on disk, and it also produces  virtual processing loops to allow each physical processor to  be shared by multiple parallel-variable elements.  A ViC* program will run significantly faster than one run  with traditional sequential virtual memory on the individual  nodes of a MIMD machine.  Unlike demand paging, ViC* will  take advantage of aggregate data-parallel operations by  optimizing away many I/O calls. Moreover, the ViC* run-time  library will execute optimal parallel-disk algorithms that  have appeared in the literature recently.  There are two major components to ViC*: a compiler and a run  time library. Both are designed to minimize the number of  parallel disk accesses made by the executing program. The  runtime library will implement the entire C* library for  both incore and out-of-core parallel variables. It will run  on any platform that supports PVM and any of the following  filesystem interfaces: Scotch, Galley, Scalable I/O  Initiative API, and UFS for multiple disks.  ***",
