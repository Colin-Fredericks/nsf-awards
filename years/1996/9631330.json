The  project is under the direction of Richard H. Pratt, University of  Pittsburgh and S.K. Sen Gupta, North Bengal University,  Darjeeling.  Simultaneous cooperative investigations, both  theoretical and experimental, are proposed on aspects of the related  processes of photon atom scattering and pair production, connected  through dispersion relations.  The project will focus on Delbruck  scattering and on atomic screening effects in pair production.  It is  expected that the combination of new theoretical calculations and  new accurate experimental data will improve our understanding of  these important photon atom interaction processes.      Scope:  This collaboration is an outgrowth of a previously funded  INT/India Program activity.  The workshop on New  Directions in  the Study of the Interaction of Energetic Photons with Matter was  held in Darjeeling in November 1995.  While the subject matter of  the workshop is a modern field, the long tradition of physics  research in both countries constitutes a strong basis for developing  ongoing cooperative activities.  In addition to the immediate  scientific benefit of the research, the collaboration will promote the   exchange of ideas, provide training of students, and foster their  exposure to the international scientific community.   ***",
