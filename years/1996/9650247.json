 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to improve the Human Performance Laboratory.  The new equipment enables the undergraduate students to perform three-dimensional human gait analysis of the lower extremities.  This capability affects the general biomechanics course, the mechanics of human locomotion course, and the independent research projects for undergraduate students.   The equipment includes a bilateral gait analysis computer program, an analog sampling system, and a force platform.  This equipment interfaces with an existing four-camera computerized video analysis system and a force platform. The entire system enables students to perform a complete description of the movement and forces of both lower extremities during one full stride of walking, running, and other forms of locomotion.  The need to examine both lower extremities is clearly evident when examining patients with abnormal asymmetrical gait.  With this system, the Human Performance Laboratory can be prepared for clinical gait analysis of patients referred from orthopedic surgeons.  This would be an excellent subject pool for projects resulting in professional presentations and publications by undergraduate students.   The new equipment is significantly improving the training of students in the mechanics of the gait cycle and is serving as a model to other schools interested in developing gait analysis for undergraduate students.",
