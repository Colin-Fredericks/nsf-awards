The  first  research objective of  this  project  is  to utilize single-electron  device  techniques to explore and understand several key issues in  mesoscopic superconductivity:  even-odd  electron  number  physics, the physics of macroscopic quantum variables, and  coherent charge transport through superconducting-normal  metal interfaces. The second objective  is to   investigate  --  and  precisely  control  --   the   quantum interaction  `etween   single-electron   devices    and    their  electromagnetic environment by utilizing the powerful  techniques of cavity quantum electrodynamics. The 60  nanometer-scale devices used   in  this  work  will  be  fabricated  using  electron-beam lithography, thin-film  metallization, and microelectronics  clean room  techniques.  An ultrahigh vacuum thin-film deposition system will  be  constructed  to  provide a  major  advancement  in  the  nanostructure device fabrication technology. Measurements  will be performed  at cryogenic temperatures (10 mK to 10 K)  using  lownoise  electronic  transport  measurement  instrumentation.   The overall  goal  of  these research  activities is  to  establish  a strong  scientific  foundation for single-electron device physics, and help it  progress toward what may become the ultimate level in  electronics technology.  %%%  The objective of this experimental research project is to  advance the  science  and  technology of single-electron  devices.  These recently  developed  devices  are nanometer  scale  structures  in which  electrical  charge can be  controlled electron-by-electron. In  the  first  part of  this project, single-electron  techniques will  be used to  explore superconductivity in ultrasmall devices. In  another  part, the interaction between single-electron devices and  their  electromagnetic environment will be investigated  and  c ontrolled  by utilizing a powerful, new technique called  cavity quantum  electrodynamics. The nanostructure devices  used in  this work  will  be fabricated using electron-beam  lithography,  thinfilm  metallization, and microelectronics  clean room  techniques. Collectively, these research  activities will help single-electron device physics progress  toward what may become the ultimate level in electronics  technology.  ***",
