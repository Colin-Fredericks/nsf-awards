 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630465  Winkler  The basic requirement for experimental investigations of  protein-folding kinetics is some means of triggering the  folding (or unfolding) process.  In this research program, a  new triggering method that permits measurements in the  nanosecond-to-millisecond time range will be employed.  Electron-transfer (ET) chemistry can trigger folding  reactions in many proteins, and there are many well  established techniques for rapidly injecting electrons into  proteins on timescales as short as a few nanoseconds.  Specifically, laser-initiated ET will be used to trigger the  folding of three high-potential heme proteins; cytochrome c,  cytochrome b562 and cytochrome f.  The complex process of  protein folding involves dynamics that span more than twelve  orders of magnitude in time (picoseconds to minutes).  The  power of ET-initiated protein folding is that it lays open  this entire time regime for direct examination; when coupled  with the techniques of protein engineering, it will permit  evaluation of the importance of individual amino acids in  each step of the folding process.  %%%  Proteins are heteropolymers (polypeptides) built from the  twenty naturally occurring amino acids, often in combination  with one or more cofactors.  The three-dimensional structure  - the fold - of a protein that defines its biological  activity is determined by the sequence of amino acids in the  polypeptide chain.  The ultimate objective in proteinfolding  research then, is the ability to predict the three  dimensional structure of a protein solely on the basis of  its amino-acid sequence.  An essential key to the problem is  understanding the series of chemical events that transforms  a randomly configured polypeptide into a fully folded  protein.  There are many methods available for studying  protein-folding kinetics but, for the most part, they are  limited to measurement timescales longer than one  millisecond.  There is compelling evidence, however, that in  many proteins a substantial degre e of secondary and tertiary  protein structure can develop on faster timescales.  Therefore, new experimental methods are required to observe  the earliest events in protein folding.  ***",
