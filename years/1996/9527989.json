 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goals of this research are to reconstruct the changes in vegetation, lake conditions, and climate that occurred over the past 20,000 years on islands of the eastern Caribbean.  Sediment deposited in two volcanic lakes on Dominca will be analyzed for physical characteristics, chemical contents, and biological remains. The first phase of this project will test a new method for detecting prehistoric hurricanes in lake sediment based on the large amounts of debris from vegetation that is washed into the lakes. These layers will be dated by lead-210 and compared with historical records of hurricanes in the same area.  It has been proposed that hurricane intensity and frequency will increase in response to climate change that warms tropical sea surface temperatures.  An understanding of the nature, ranges, and timing of past hurricanes and the responses of  the plant communities to hurricanes will provide a guide to responses that are possible in the future.",
