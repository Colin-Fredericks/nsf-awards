 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  research  addresses  the problem of  immobilizing  a  three-  dimensional  object  through a few contacts with  simple  modular  components, with applications in manufacturing fixture design and  robotic  grasping.   The  proposed  approach  is  based  on   the  kinematic notion of second-order immobility introduced  by  Rimon  and  Burdick.   From  a  practical point  of  view,  the  planned  research   is   motivated  by  its  applications  in  small-batch  manufacturing,  rapid prototyping, and on-demand manufacturing  .  The scientific objectives are (1) to develop efficient algorithms  for   automatically   enumerating  all  of  the   fixture/gripper  configurations  and  the  corresponding workpiece  positions  and  orientations for which a truely three-dimensional workpiece  will  be  completely  immobilized; (2) to  develop  grasp  and  fixture  planning  strategies capable of handling positioning  uncertainty  during  grasping  and fixture loading operations;  and  (3)  more  generally,  to develop general analytical tools for  holding  and  manipulating complex three-dimensional shapes with devices having  a  mixture  of  discrete and continuous degrees of freedom.   The  process  achieved in this project will be assessed by  conducting  experiments  with actual fixtures and the prototype  of  a  novel  automatically reconfigurable gripper.",
