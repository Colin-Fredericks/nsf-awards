It contains over 8500 specimens and this collection plus their  present collection will bring into being one of the finest regional  mineral collections available.  With it they will develop exhibits  and programming that explore minerals and mining of Mexico and the  southwestern U.S.  With this planning grant, they will explore the  exhibition and programming opportunities to realize their vision of  creating a \"living and engaging museum that promotes an  understanding of basic science principles and an appreciation for  the beauty and economic importance of minerals in the context of  the historical and cultural perspective of the New World.\"  The  planning activities will include meetings of the advisory  committee, visits to other museums, and development of two  prototype exhibits.  At the end of the twelve-month planning period  they will have an overall script for the exhibit and  recommendations for individual exhibit units, a traveling exhibit  version, and curriculum materials for use by formal educators.",
