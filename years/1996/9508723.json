 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract      9508723  Epstein    The objective of this research is to explore electrically  conducting polymers. Despite the extensive studies there are many  open questions concerning the correct description of the metallic  state of the various conducting polymers and the determination of  the ultimately achievable conductivity of each of these families of  conducting polymers. In this research, an extensive array of  correlated charge transport, magnetic and optical studies of highly  conducting polymers (including doped polythiophenes, doped  polypyrroles and doped polyanilines) is planned. In addition to  traditional experiments such as electrical conductivity,  thermopower, and susceptibility, frequency-dependent studies will  be emphasized to gain insight into microscopic processes. The  dielectric constant and conductivity will be obtained at microwave  frequencies and also from the far ir to the uv. For the first time  synchrotron radiation will be used to span the important region  between the microwave and the far ir. Where appropriate,  experiments will be conducted at very high magnetic fields or very  low temperatures. Correlation of the results of these studies with  structural and compositional information of the different polymer  systems should elucidate the design criteria for creating truly  metallic polymers, some with conductivities even exceeding that of  copper.   %%%  Electrically conducting polymers have been studied for the past 1.5  decades. Highly conducting polymer materials have expanded from  doped polyacetylene to include also doped polypyrrole, doped  polythiophene, doped polyaniline, and their many derivatives and  related polymers. There continue to be important advances in these  materials and their understanding. Initially, these systems were  only modestly good conductors, and, in fact, became insulators at  low temperatures. The present generation of materials have  conductivities in the range of that of traditional metals. This new  generation of conduct ing polymers share other properties in common  with traditional metals (such as a negative dielectric constant).  Despite the extensive studies there are many open questions  concerning the correct description of the metallic state of the  various conducting polymers and the determination of the ultimately  achievable conductivity of each of these families of conducting  polymers. These issues are the subject of this research. Success in  this research program would have an impact in the understanding of  electronic polymers, nanostructured materials, and concepts of  localization, delocalization, and electronic properties in reduced  dimensions. Also, development of a fundamental understanding of the  metallic state will impact the implementation of metallic polymers  in technologies ranging from electromagnetic interference shielding  to molecular manufacturing, to improved environmentally friendly  materials for ease of recycling.",
