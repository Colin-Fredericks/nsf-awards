Preliminary data  suggest that the Maastrichtian and possibly Paleocene environment  of Antarctica was dry enough to permit generation of sufficient  dust to form an important component of the sediments surrounding  the continent.  This research will determine if and when this  semi-arid climate did exist on Antarctica and when it was  superseded by more moist conditions.  The transition to fluvial  and hemipelagic dominated erosional processes may shed light on  the initial formation of glaciers in the Antarctic hinterland.  At the time of the Eocene/Oligocene boundary, changing sediment  accumulation rates and the relative proportions of hemipelagic  and ice-rafted material will provide information on when the  Antarctic ice sheet became well-established, effectively shutting  off the supply of fluvial sediment to the Southern Ocean. And  finally, any significant change in the ice sheet configuration  during the early Pliocene should be readily observable in the  concomitant changes in the nature and rates of terrigenous  sedimentation.  To accomplish these goals, this project will examine the  terrigenous component of deep sea sediments of the Southern  Ocean.  These materials contain a dual record of the environment  of Antarctica and of the sedimentary transport processes.  Techniques of mineral grain extraction, grain-size analysis,  magnetic fabric determination, geochemical characterization, and  flux calculation, all of which have proven diagnostic in the  interpretation of paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic conditions,  will be applied within this project to unravel the history of  environmental change on the Antarctic continent.",
