Funds from NSF will be used to partially support costs of travel, accommodations, and registration fees of young American scientists and graduate students in cases where their attendance at the meeting would not otherwise be possible.    We have added several new conference activities this year. A corporate management panel will discuss opportunities in plasma science from an industrial perspective. This Monday evening session, open to all attendees, will allow graduate students to see for themselves what various industries hope to get from plasma science in the next several years. We have expanded the number of technical session categories to twenty-eight, grouped under seven super-session categories, with three new session topics: inertial confinement fusion, thermal plasma processing, and flat panel displays. Two special sessions on \"Computer Simulation of Vacuum Power Tubes\" and \"Space Plasma Measurements - New Techniques and Technology\" have been introduced to promote interest in these areas. An afternoon meeting on stimulating \"Advanced Lighting Research\" will take place on Wednesday; representatives from government and industries will discuss new research proposals. This is a special attraction for graduate students to participate in research that impacts the environment as well as our US energy policies.    With such diverse programs, ICOPS '96 showcases a steady expansion of plasma science research into critical areas that help shape the nation's economic well being and industrial competitiveness. The plenary sessions highlight recent advances in plasma science research as well as the role of past and future government funding. Students may participate in any of the above mentioned areas which will enhance and develop their rese arch and scholarship.  ===============",
