 "awd_abstract_narration": "Zhang  9625907  The investigator studies high order mixed finite element  methods on tetrahedral meshes for the 3D stationary Stokes  problems, and the iterative solvers for the resulting discrete  linear systems of equations.  Preliminary work done by the  investigator finds a family of stable mixed elements on some  macro-element type grids.   This result indicates the possibility  of finding the minimal polynomial degree of continuous piecewise  polynomials for the velocity where one degree less piecewise  polynomials are employed to approximate the pressure and the  mixed elements are stable; this has been an open problem for more  than a decade.   The investigator studies various augmented  Lagrangian methods (including the well-known Uzawa method and the  iterative penalty method) where the effective multigrid method  or/and domain decomposition method are combined to achieve the  optimal order of computation.  The difficulty in the design of  both the mixed elements and the iterative methods is to treat the  incompressible condition.  The investigator develops computer algorithms for some  well-known equations in incompressible fluid dynamics.  Problems  of incompressible computational fluid dynamics arise throughout  industry and science.  There are difficult challenges in  developing these methods involving limits of computer memory and  speed,  as well as accuracy and robustness of the method itself.  The algorithm is expected to have applications to areas such as  airfoil design and to manufacturing processes involving fluid  flow in complex shapes, for example, the chemical industry.",
