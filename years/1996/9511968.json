 "awd_abstract_narration": "Student Pugwash USA , a national, educational, non-profit organization based in Washington DC is dedicated to building a commitment among young people to integrate social concerns into their academic, professional, and personal lives.  The Pugwash organization, through a variety of interdisciplinary activities, focuses on leadership development and interactive learning, educating young people on the relevance of science and technology to their own lives, and on its ability to shape the future of the global community.  This award is in partial support of three important components of  these activities: 1) the coordination of an international conference on science and technology themes,  2) the publication of a resultant Science, Technology, and Society (STS) Guidebook for use by university students and high school teachers, and  3) the support of  a Chapter Program which coordinates  nearly 150 local campus-based events each year.  More specifically,  under this award,  Pugwash will coordinate an international conference on `Science, Technology, and Ethical Priorities` with working groups in International Weapons Trade; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Alternative Energy Sources; Access and the Internet; Water Quality and Availability;  and Public Participation in Scientific Decision-making.  Second, it will edit and produce the resulting Global Issues Guidebook, which will be authored by the International Conference Participants and other students.  Third,  Pugwash will disseminate and implement the Global Issues Guidebook among high school teachers, national student organizations, and over 22 Student Pugwash USA chapters/contacts on high school, college, and university campuses nationwide.",
