 "awd_abstract_narration": "The current project is to complete the research necessary for  writing a grammar of Pilaga, a Guaykuruan language of Argentina.       The Guaykuruan languages represent a significant gap in our  current knowledge of languages of the world. At present, no  comprehensive grammar exists for any language of this family.  Furthermore, linguists have no clear sense of how the Guaykuruan  family is genetically related to any other family.       A grammar of Pilaga will serve various purposes. One is to  document a language about which information is extremely scarce.  A reference grammar of Pilaga will address topics of current  interest among general linguists, such as grammatical relations,  word order, lexicalization patterns and syntactic reanalysis of  categories.       The grammar will be accompanied by a collection of texts  that will capture part of the Pilaga culture, and illustrate the  use of the language in various discourse genres, including  narrative and conversational discourse.       Methods to be employed are a combination of traditional  field techniques, i.e., recording, transcribing and translating  texts; modern data processing; and the application of some recent  methodologies in discourse analysis.       The timing is urgent for this project. Pilaga is spoken by  2500 people and is under intense sociolinguistic pressure from  Spanish. The language of the youngest generations shows a high  level of borrowings and switching between Spanish and Pilaga  during particular linguistic exchanges is evident.",
