 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625129  Cherkaev    A program of research is proposed for structural optimization of elastic and   conducting bodies which combines modern variational techniques,   homogenization, and new computational methods.  Since structural   optimization problems are typically ill-posed as stated, the efficiency and   stability of numerical algorithms for these problems depends upon   theoretical formulation of a well-posed problem. The expected results   include  advances in relaxation of non-convex variational problems,   discovery of new microstructures with extremal properties, and developing   effective algorithms for highly sensitive problems. The applications include   real-time design of practical optimal  structures, such as rotors, cylindrical   shells, wheels, domes, etc.  Various efficiency functionals such as the   overall stiffness, principal eigenfrequency, weighted deflection, etc. will be   examined.   Systematic selection of suboptimal projects will also be   considered.    The research involves improving upon and integrating the best current   theoretical and computational methods for systematically designing   structures with optimal performance characteristics. This permits the   reduction of the overall cost of materials, and their weight,  which greatly   influences the ultimate cost in aerospace and similar applications.  The   theoretical aspect involves understanding the nature of optimal   microstruatures, while the computational aspect involves distributing and   modifying these composites to best adapt to practical working conditions.    The efficiency of both the design methods and the designs themselves   should prove advantageous  in industrial applications.",
