 "awd_abstract_narration": "INT 9515511  Vary        This U.S.-Slovak theoretical physics project between Dr. James Vary of the Iowa State University and Dr. Lubomir Martinovic of the Slovak Academy of Sciences' Institute of Physics will examine light-front quantization.  The goal of the team is to use a systematic and practical approach to the evaluation of the Hamiltonian framework in quantum field theory for analytical and numerical applications.    The researchers intend to focus their efforts on quantum chromodynamics (QCD), a strongly interacting field theory that can be compared with experiments in the non-perturbative regime.  Test applications will be developed to demonstrate concepts and illustrate utility.  Initial efforts will feature a 1+1 dimension problem and a second one, in 3+1 dimension, that will incorporate findings from the first.  This work should yield models for investigating specific formal and numerical issues in field theories.  Overall, results are expected to facilitate the construction of equations for effective Hamiltonian methods useful in study of high energy physics phenomenology.    This project combining nuclear theory and mathematical physics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the Untied States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.    ??",
