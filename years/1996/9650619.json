 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through acquisition of a fluorimeter and a pulsed laser fluorescence system, this project incorporates fluorescence and time-resolved pulsed laser spectroscopy experiments into six laboratory courses in the Chemistry Department. Until now, the department has lacked equipment for introducing students to laser-based or fluorescence spectroscopy techniques that have become increasingly important in the undergraduate curriculum. The objectives of the sequence of experiments in this project are to introduce students to important concepts in steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy and to provide students with firsthand experience with corresponding applications in diverse areas of chemistry. To achieve these objectives, the project incorporates fluorescence and time-resolved laser spectroscopy into courses spanning the curriculum in quantitative analysis, in biochemistry, and in the advanced integrated chemistry laboratory. The topics of new or modified experiments to be introduced through the project are Ca2+ ion determination, chymotrypsin denaturation, introduction to ELISA, ethidium bromide binding, static versus dynamic quenching, time-resolved fluorescence of aromatic compounds in water, fluorescence control in zeolites, and luminescence decay rates of Eu3+. Because each of the chemistry degree programs (chemistry, biochemistry, and environmental science) requires students to take several of the courses involving these experiments, all majors are able to develop a solid understanding of fluorescence spectroscopy. Information and laboratory materials generated by the proposed experiments can be presented at professional meetings. Precollege teachers have access to the planned experiments through workshops and curriculum projects of the Saint Vincent College Teacher Enhancement Institute and the BRIDGES Project.",
