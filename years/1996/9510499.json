This work will be undertaken in an academic-industrial collaboration with Don Tennant of ATT Bell Laboratories (Holmdel).  ATT is now installing a JEOL JBX-6000FS electron beam lithography system with a field emission gun which is just the second of its kind to be delivered to the United States.  This system will be used to fabricate 20-30 nanometer resolution soft x-ray zone plates for microscopy, and diffractive optics for tests of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems for integrated circuit printing.  It will also be used to fabricate zone plates which will be used by Dr. Wen-Bing Yun of Argonne National Laboratory as x-ray lithography masks for the generation of thick zone plates for hard x-ray applications, such as fluorescence  microprobe studies.  The x-ray experiments will be  carried out using high brightness undulators at Brookhaven National Laboratory and at Argonne National Laboratory.",
