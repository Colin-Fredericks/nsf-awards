 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nagle  9511773      Small protein molecules or peptides, play an important role in  communication between cells in the brain.  The synthesis of these  peptides is a complex task involving the excision of the peptide  from a larger precursor molecule by specific enzymes.  Moreover,  these peptides must be compartmentalized or packaged in the brain  in such away that they can be released upon stimulation of the  brain cell.  To accomplish this release, the larger precursor  molecules and the enzymes to process the precusor must be co-stored  so the information transmitting peptide can be cut from the larger  molecule and released between cells.  However, how this packaging  of material is accomplished remains unknown.  Dr. Nagle will use a  well-established system to investigate how the enzymes responsible  for cleaving these peptides from their precursors is accomplished.   It is anticipated that these studies will also identify specific  domains in the enzymes responsible for targeting the  peptide-containing precursors and enzymes to the appropriate  secretory apparatus.  These studies are of fundamental importance  in understanding the transfer of information between cells.  The  findings from these studies are applicable to cells in the brain,  as well as peripheral tissues.  More importantly, however, these  studies provide information on the biochemical basis by which  information is transmitted between cells in the nervous system or  the basis of the way the brain functions.",
