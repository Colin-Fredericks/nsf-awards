 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objectives of the proposed research are: (1) to develop  an integrated multimedia computing environment that supports  efficient mechanisms for storage, transmission, and presentation  of information in multiple forms (e.g., video, audio, images,  text, and numeric data); and (2) to utilize it to develop  innovative methods for delivering education.  To achieve these  objectives, the proposed research promises to develop an  end-to-end architecture consisting of: (i) a multimedia file  system that supports efficient means for storage and retrieval of  multi-resolution multimedia objects, (ii) network algorithms and  protocols for efficient transmission of multimedia objects over  networks, and (iii) processor scheduling mechanisms as well as  transport and higher layer protocols that support efficient  processing and streaming of data at the end-station. The  end-to-end system architecture thus created will form the basis  for: (a) creating a digital repository of educational material  containing video-lectures, notes, presentation slides, simulation  packages, animation, images, etc., on several inter-disciplinary  topics, and (b) providing efficient methods for organizing and  browsing through the information space. In addition to being a  realistic testbed for evaluating the end-to-end system  architecture, this digital library prototype will provide an  excellent environment for evaluating the effectiveness of various  methods of distance learning and self-paced education. The  findings of this research will significantly impact the design of  large-scale digital libraries and distance learning tools of the  future.  ***",
