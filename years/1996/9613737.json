The goal of the collaboration is to combine  expanded research in visual servo control of robotic manipulators  at the University of Illinois with research on dynamics and  control at CICSE. This should enable consideration of robot  dynamics in the design and evaluation of visual servo  controllers, thereby yielding active visual systems of more  robust design.  The research, which has previously focused on  geometric aspects, will be expanded to include the system  dynamics.  The research at CICSE will develop a framework for  evaluating a class of visual servo controllers and will also  yield a basis for performing rigorous stability analyses.  This  should lead to new capabilities for engineering robotic systems  in which the camera placement and the robot configuration for  manipulability can be optimized simultaneously. That could expand  the range of potential applications of visual servoing,  especially to situations involving moving obstacles and target  objects that are moving in the scene.",
