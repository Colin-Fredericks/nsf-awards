 "awd_abstract_narration": "Application software for 100 TeraOps machines be based on the increasing use of component software (libraries, GUIs, problem solving environments) and extensive use of interoperability frameworks (CORBA, OLE, SOM, etc.), producing applications which are complex conglomerates of variegated programs.  To support these applications, the machine must present  a programmable interface (i.e. efficient shared address spaces and data movement) and scaleable high performance.  This project will study a flexible machine architecture that recognizes these technological realities and not only supports advanced software structures, but exploits them to configure its programmable hardware, adapting itself to the application.  The programming flexibility can provide a wide range of convenient interfaces, ranging from uniform cache-coherent shared memory, to clusters of smaller shared memory systems, to fully distributed memory.  In addition to a range of interfaces, this flexible machine can customize both operations and protocols, exploiting appropriate mechanisms and policies to minimize the critical performance aspect--communication--at all levels of the system.  This machine design leverages the wealth of research into optimal architectural mechanisms, customizable cache-coherence, as well as technological advances in interprocedural analysis, programmable hardware, and hardware synthesis technology, to achieve general-purpose high performance.",
