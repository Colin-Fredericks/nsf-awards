 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600391  Banerjee      The Notch signaling pathway has been found to function in Drosophila, C elegans and mammals to promote cell-cell interactions that lead to the adoption of specific cell fates.  Notch is a transmembrane receptor; many components of the Notch pathway have been identified, including ligands such as Serrate and Delta as well as downstream cytoplasmic and nuclear components such as Deltex and Suppressor of Hairless respectively.  Previous studies in Dr. Banerjee's laboratory have shown that the strawberry notch (sno) gene functions as a positive component of the Notch signal transduction pathway.  He has now clmned the sno gene and shown that it encodes a novel nuclear protein expressed in all epidermal cells.  Analysis of expression patterns has suggested that sno functions downstream of  Notch in controlling the transcription of several transcription factors that are important for the development of the wing margin.  These studies have suggested that Sno functions in a subset of Notch functions:  those that lead to induction of cellular identity, but not in those that involve lateral inhibition.  As part of this proposal, he will further investigate the function of sno in the Notch pathway.  He will test the hypothesis that Sno responds to a signal from Serrate and therefore allows the regulation of wing margin genes directly.  He will determine if sno functions in a similar pathway initiated by Delta during oogenesis.  Additionally, proteins that interact with Sno will be identified  using biochemical and two hybrid screening approaches.  In particular, he will test the possibility, suggested by extensive genetic analysis, that Sno may interact directly with the protein encoded by the Suppressor of Hairless gene that also functions downstream of Notch to regulate the transcription of the same proteins that are also controlled by Sno.  He has also devised a genetic selection technique for the isolation of other genes that interact closely with Sno.  One promising mutant has b een isolated and the screen will be extended to identify other genes in the pathway.  Finally, in an exciting development, he has identified human and C elegans genes, isolated as part of genome projects, that share a strong degree of similarity to the sno gene.  He plans to set up collaborations with mammalian and C.elegans developmental biology laboratories to determine if a conservation of Sno function in these diverse species is also evident, as seems to be the case for many other members of the Notch pathway.",
