 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS 96-25897  Christensen     The investigators study methods for evaluating the independence  assumption in standard normal theory linear models and in  generalized linear models.  The research develops both formal  tests and informal graphical procedures for evaluating  independence.  The methods are based on the formation of rational  subgroups of observations that were collected under similar  circumstances.  The formal tests for independence are based on  models that incorporate the subgroups into the linear structure.   For normal theory linear models the procedures can also be used  to provide tests for variance component models.  The researchers  study the properties of these tests.    Statistical models are widely used in the physical and social  sciences for prediction and for understanding the relationships  among factors in complex systems.  Statistical models are used in  environmental evaluation, to improve industrial processes, and to  develop chemical processes.  An important assumption made in most  statistical models is that observations are obtained  ``independently'' of one another.  This assumption has important  ramifications for the validity of statistical procedures.  Assuming independence, when it is not true, can lead to erroneous  conclusions.  Unfortunately, this assumption has traditionally  been very difficult to evalute.  The investigators develop new  methods for evaluating the validity of the independence  assumption and study the behavior of those methods.",
