 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  Pasquale  9302387         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a \"wearable\" information system for site supervisory personnel that provides up-to-date project information such as project schedule, design changes, and other project details and enables the supervisor to easily and accurately record job progress and site conditions. The construction industry has failed to adopt and apply new information system technology as quickly as most other industries. Specifically, construction field site management and supervision has seen little improvement in techniques for data gathering, progress reporting and communications between field sites and corporate offices. During this research computer hardware and software will be developed that will provide site supervisors with an information management tool in a hands-free, voice activated environment. Several \"wearable\" prototype computers will be designed and created using commercially available components such as a miniature computer processor, heads-up display monitor, a voice recognition system, and a cellular telephone. The system components will be fitted to a standard construction hard hat. The prototypes will be field tested at construction sites by supervisors managing actual construction projects. Results of field testing and evaluation will yield further system refinements for use in developing a set of design specifications for future commercial product development.       The introduction of a \"wearable\" information system for hands-free, voice activated construction site management could yield great benefits in construction site productivity and should lead to reduced errors caused by inaccurate or out-dated information. Widespread implementation of \"wearable\" information systems should greatly improve the effectiveness of communications on the modern construction site.  ***",
