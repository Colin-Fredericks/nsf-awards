 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS 9625350  Altman      Linear and generalized linear mixed models are powerful tools for  analysis of longitudinal response curves.  This research focuses  on semi-parametric extensions of these models: recovery of the  underlying curve via self-modeling methods,  estimation and  inference for parameters which summarize covariate effects and  the use of the curves as data in statistical routines such as  analysis of designed experiments, discriminant analysis and  clustering.  A novel feature of the representation is separate  parametrization of the time and response axes which allows the  covariates to act on the response both by changes in the level of  response and by time dilation or contraction.  Estimation and  inferential techniques are under development.  The methodology  has applications in the many areas in which mixed models are  used:  medical and epidemiological research, environmental  studies, public policy assessment, and economics, to name just a  few.     In many studies the response of each individual can be thought of  as a curve over time.  Examples include the the progression of  HIV infection in patients under different treatment programs and  the degradation of pesticides in different soils under different   environmental conditions.  Similar types of data are used for  public policy assessment, economics, psychology, pharmokinetics  and numerous other fields.  Understanding the evolution of  response over time can be critical to interpreting the effects of  treatments and other influences.  Recent advances in statistical  modeling have greatly improved the efficiency of estimating  treatment effects but require that the investigator specify the  shape of the response curve and the types of treatment effects  expected prior to analyzing the data.  The methods developed for  this project allows the shape of the response curve to be  determined from the observed data, while retaining simple  measures of treatment effects.  A novel feature is that  treatments which stretch  the time scale of the response (for  example, by slowing disease progression) are handled in a natural  way.  Related work covered by this project involves the use of  response curves to find subgroups with similar response evolution  and for classification of individuals into groups, such as  healthy and diseased.",
