 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposal is to establish the  instrumentation base required for initiating a protein chemistry  laboratory to serve the needs of PIs involved in protein research  at Texas A&M University. Texas A&M has made a long term  commitment of $195,000/year to hire and retain an exceptional  Ph.D. level working director ($45K start ) as well as a senior  (25K) and junior technician (18K) to support the laboratory. The  remainder of the annual budget will be for supplies and  maintenance ($107K). Sufficient space has been provided in the  department of chemistry so that the established Laboratory for  Biological Mass Spectrometry and the proposed Protein Chemistry  Laboratory will located in contiguous space allowing a MALDI mass  spectrometer to be shared between the facilities. The Ph.D.  working director of the biological mass spectrometry laboratory,  which is already serving over 100 PIs on campus, will be  instrumental in training the Ph.D. level director of the Protein  laboratory in mass spectrometry to take advantages of the  emerging mass spectrometric characterization and sequencing  methods. The new laboratory will be advertised by seminars in  various departments by the faculty director and by a home page on  the world wide web.       The analysis of typical protein samples will be handled by  purchasing a ninhydrin-based Amino acid analyzer for protein and  peptide composition analysis as well as for concentration  determinations and a protein sequencer which utilizes  phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) chemistry for sequencing peptides of  less than Ca thirty residues. The required separations  capabilities will be met initially by the purchase of a variable  temperature HPLC fitted with a dual wavelength UV-Vis recorder  and a capillary zone electrophoresis set up. These will be used  for determining the number of chemically different polypeptide  chains in a given sample (after disulfide reduction and  denaturation) and for purification of  samples which are not of  the required purity. The capillary zone electrophoresis set up is  particularly important as it can separate polypeptides that  cannot be separated by routine RP-HPLC. Classical SDS-PAGE /  electroblotting technology will also be incorporated into the  Protein laboratory to allow PTH sequencing directly from a 1- or  2D-SDS PAGE gel. Eventually peptide synthesis services will be  offered, but only after the research community at A&M is pleased  with protein sequencing and related services which is where we  are severely deficient. Our logic here is that peptide synthesis  can be accomplished with outside vendors and in collaboration  with several research laboratories with expertise, although this  situation is still not ideal. When the time comes the Kelly  Laboratory will donate their 1995 vintage ABI peptide synthesizer  to the Protein Chemistry laboratory in return for weekend  privileges. This instrument is currently being utilized by  several groups whose use would be best accommodated under the  auspices of the laboratory for protein chemistry.       In addition to handling and delegating responsibilities for  routine samples (70% effort) the director of the laboratory will  be responsible for bringing emerging technology into the  laboratory after consulting with the faculty advisory committee  which oversees the laboratory (15% effort). We envision  significant interaction between the working directors of the mass  spectrometry and protein laboratories, particularly with regard  to making edge of the envelope methods available to non-experts.  The director in collaboration with the faculty advisory committee  would also be responsible for advertising and teaching  mini-courses periodically to train undergraduate, graduate  students and post-doctorals how to best use the technology  available in this facility(l5% effort). Laboratories who make  extensive use of the facility may elect to have their graduate  students become more intimately familiar with the opera tion of  the equipment m a supervised manner. As a result of this policy  in the mass spectrometry laboratory the graduate students at A&M  understand these techniques well enough that there now is a  walkup MAIDI instrument for their use.    The long term objective is to build a superb protein chemistry  laboratory which serves the needs of A&M faculty in a variety of  departments interested in various aspects of protein chemistry.  An important feature of such a facility is that the faculty,  graduate students and post-doctorals in a wide range of  disciplines become intimately familiar with classical and  emerging technology for protein characterization. In addition  students and faculty in various departments end up talking to one  another often leading to substantive collaborations between  research groups.",
