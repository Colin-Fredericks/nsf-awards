 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626404  Le          Thang Le is studying links in 3-manifolds as well  as quasicrystals.  The study of links concerns quantum and  finite type invariants of knots and links in 3-manifolds, including  generalizations of Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants.  The study of quasicrystals involves local rules that determine  quasiperiodic tilings of Euclidean space.       Each of the topics in this project is intimately related to  physics.  The most powerful invariants of knots and links currently known  (i.e., most likely to distinguish among different but similar objects)    find their motivation in quantum field theory.  The algebraic aspect of  the theory is beautiful and rich in results.  However, the invariants   remain difficult to compute except in simple cases, and their intrinsic  topological meaning remains obscure.  The second topic, quasicrystals,  stems from the discovery in 1984 of solid substances whose spectrum has   sharp peaks enjoying some symmetries that real crystals do not (for  example, 5-fold symmetry).  It is believed that a mathematical model of    a quasicrystal is a quasiperiodic tiling of space, such as the famous   Penrose tilings of the plane discovered in 1973 by the physicist Roger   Penrose but considered at that time to be only a mathematical curiosity.  The project aims to shed light on each of these topics.  ***",
