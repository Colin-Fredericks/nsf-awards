 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on the development of computational tools for  analyzing and comparing sequences.  An important aspect of this  work is the collaboration with scientists in the biological  sciences.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the development of  computational tools for the detection of multiple repeated regions  and tandem repeats in both DNA and protein sequences.  These  regions are very important as they have been associated with  regulatory, stabilizing, and evolutionary sites.  Many such  repeated regions are difficult to detect because the repetitions  are inexact, sometimes exhibiting a low percentage of identical  symbols.  An analysis will be conducted to gain more insight into  the difficult problem of determining the threshold for statistical  significance of such repeats.  The efficient identification of  multiple repeats requires a subtle similarity measure.  This will  require the identification and representation of optimal as well as  near optimal alignments between subsequences.  An empirical  comparative study will be conducted to assess the applicability and  significance of the new algorithms.    Interactive activities include teaching a seminar to encourage a  dialogue between students from different disciplines; visiting  local high schools; organizing group meetings with undergraduate  interns; and interacting with the graduate students; participating  in journal clubs, colloquium and seminars; and engaging in joint  research with other members of the Biochemistry, Medical  Informatics and Genome Center at Stanford University.",
