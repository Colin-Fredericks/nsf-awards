 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623025  Liu    We are interested in studying the behaviour of nonlinear waves  for  quasilinear hyperbolic-parabolic partial differential equations.  Physical systems include the compressible Navier-Stokes and Euler  euqations, MHD, and nonlinear elasticity equations. We are also  interested in the nonlinear waves for the finite difference  schemes  for the computations for these systems. The approach based on  nonlinear superpositions and the Green functions for nonlinear  waves has proved effective in studying the nonlinear waves  for PDE in one space variable. For instance we show that shocks  more or less compressive than the classical gas dynamic shocks  depend  on the dissipative variable in sensitive ways previously  unsuspected. We intend to generalize and  refine the approach to numerical waves and also to PDE in  more than one space variable. Preliminary success in the study  of dissipative schemes and nonlinear stability and instability  of 2-dimensional weak and strong shocks indicates that the  approach  is suitable for more general studies.  %%%  Physical phenomena occur in gas flow, solar wind, combustions,  solid materials are often highly nonlinear. Compression,  expansion, shearing, bending of materials give rise to  waves, whose behaviour is made richer by the chemical reactions,  electro-magnetic and other effects that are also present.  There are several different types of waves which interact  nonlinearly. The goal of the present proposal is to study  these noninear phenomena using mathematical technique recently  introduced by the proposer, which are able to detect the local as  well  as global effects of wave interactions.  Of importance to our project is the understanding of numerical  schemes for the computations of these problems. Our  approach is beginning to yield the intricate wave phenomena  for the schemes which will help us to design effective schemes  for computing complex physical situations such as that of  combustions.  ***",
