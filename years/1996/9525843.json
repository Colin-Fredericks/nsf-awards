 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Somerset Laboratory is a facility being developed at the  University of Virginia that provides a focus for  experimental research in safety-critical software  engineering.  Over the long term, the intent of the  laboratory is to establish empirical research with safety-  critical systems as a sub-field of software engineering.    The laboratory provides the following to researchers World  wide, via the Internet: (1) A comprehensive set of artifacts  associated with a small number of safety-critical  applications that, to the extent possible, describe the  applications accurately and comprehensively. There are  sufficient artifacts and the artifacts are of sufficient  quality that researchers can perform substantial experiments  which will be very similar to those that they could be  perform if they had direct access to the actual  applications. (2) A repository of the results of research  projects undertaken using the available applications. This  repository contains contributed artifacts, tools, research  papers, data files, and contact information. As well as  allowing dissemination of results, the repository  facilitates cooperative research by alerting researchers to  the status, plans, and work of others. (3) A vehicle for  accurate comparison of software engineering techniques for  safetycritical systems. Using the artifacts associated with  the safety-critical applications in the laboratory,  researchers are able to evaluate tools and techniques and  then compare and contrast different tools and techniques.  The comparisons are especially significant in this case  because data is obtained by applying them to precisely the  same applications.    By carrying out experiments using extensive material from  actual safety-critical applications, researchers are  presented with the complex details of such applications.  Dealing with these details helps to ensure the relevance and  practical value of the research that is undertaken. In  addition, once a solution concept or approach is devised,  it  can be evaluated (at least in part) by applying it to one or  more sample safetycritical applications thus providing a  believable assessment. The first safety-critical application  that the laboratory has chosen to support is a nuclear  reactor. The reactor is a lowpower, research reactor that  employs a conventional electromechanical control system.  Though a small reactor, it presents significant challenges  to researchers interested in softwarebased control and  safety systems. The artifacts being developed for the  laboratory include details of the reactor's physical  structure, the safety rules that must be enforced, digitized  images of key elements of the physical equipment, sample  traces of all the reactor's sensors, a reactor simulator,  and complete wiring diagrams.  The goal of this planning grant is to obtain an assessment  of the likely level of interest in the laboratory by the  research community and to develop a detailed plan for the  implementation of the laboratory.  ***",
