 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    PI:  Beecher  Proposal Numbers:  9632193                                      Bird song is widely recognized as a model system for  nvestigations into the biological basis of learning.  It  provides the best example to date of natural learning in a  vertebrate, with many striking parallels to human language  learning.  Moreover, in recent years many discoveries  concerning the brain mechanisms underlying song learning  have suggested that this model system may reveal much about  the general processes of learning in the brain.  We propose  to use both field and laboratory studies to examine song  learning.  We believe that the field perspective is crucial  for understanding the song learning process, because the   rules  of song learning we have discovered in the field  turn out to be quite different  from the rules that had been  inferred from laboratory studies.  The first important goal  of the proposed studies is to resolve and understand the  discrepancies between the field and laboratory findings to  date, because the utility of this model system for study of  neurobiological correlates will be undermined if the  laboratory studies are unduly artificial and produce  artifactual results.  A second goal of the work is to  compare individuals from sedentary populations (resident in  the same area throughout the year) and migratory populations  (breeding and wintering grounds widely separated) of a  species.  There are a variety of reasons for predicting that  animals from these populations will be very different with  respect to both song learning and song usage in  communication.  These studies will allow us to assess the  relative contributions of proximate ecological differences  aad population genetic differences in producing song  learning differences between sedentary and migratory  populations.  A third goal is to evaluate the role of  females in the development of male song.  In most North  American species of songbirds, females do not sing, but  t here is considerable evidence that they can strongly  influence both the development and phylogeny of male song  traits.  A fourth goal of the work is to examine individuals  use of their vocal repertoire for communication in natural  ontexts, and effects of vocal  repertoire for communication  in natural contexts, and the effects of vocal repertoire  differences among individuals on their survival and lifetime  reproductive success.",
