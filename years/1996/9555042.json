 "awd_abstract_narration": "Expert observers of the software industry agree that it is  woefully inadequate to meet the needs of the information age  (e. g., Gibbs, 1994, p. 86). Simultaneously, the education  we provide students continues to be in the  scientific/mathematical tradition of computer science, which  assumes that the foundations provided therein are  sufficiently mature and robust to support the emergent,  and/or existing, commercial practices. Both the problems in  the software industry and evidence about how students learn  indicate that current computer science curricula are  inadequate to prepare practitioners. Software process issues  need to be taught explicitly and woven into a curriculum  that delivers the fundamentals of good practice integrated  with the substance of good science. The purpose of this  project is to develop laboratories for a subset of the five  course software sequence of the computer science major.  These laboratories will use a skills-based approach to help  students identify and reflect upon the efficacy of their  practices.  The development of the laboratories will proceed  by user-based design principles in which prototypes will be  tried and evaluated formatively. The resulting laboratories  will be evaluated within and across courses, resulting in a  test both of individual laboratories and the cumulative  effect of the entire curriculum. The project will produce an  on-line system that allows students to build portfolios of  their work and an on-line system for faculty that will  record the types of problems being used in the curriculum.  Materials to support the use of these systems will also be  developed.",
