 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of eleven US materials  scientists from eleven different universities in a US-Germany  workshop examining the frontiers of knowledge about the  properties of polymers and how to synthesize them.  The meeting  was co-organized by Julia Kornfeld of Caltech, Bruce Novak of  University of Massachusetts, Friedrich Kremer of the University  of Leipzig and Rudolf Zentel of the University of Mainz.  This  will be the first such workshop held in Germany since the  unification of East and West Germany; the siting of the workshop  in Leipzig was intended to emphasize the contributions to this  field that were stimulated by the blending of the two research  communities since that time.  The US and Germany are two leading  countries in the field of polymer science, and this meeting will  benefit both countries by fostering cooperation among the  talented participants who are all at early stages in their  scientific careers.  Polymers are highly deserving of special attention through  collaboration between world class scientists.  The demands placed  on molecularly engineered materials requires the use of polymers  possessing predetermined properties and behaviors.  Many  properties depend strongly on small variations in fine structural  features.  Architecturally well-defined polymeric materials will  play key roles in advancing existing materials and in developing  emerging technologies including optical fibers, electronic  materials and biomedical polymers.  This workshop will examine  the state of the art as well as areas for fruitful collaboration  in the areas of preparation, characterization and applications of  several classes of polymers.",
