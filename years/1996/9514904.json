 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514904  Ji    This U.S.-Polish Cooperative Research award is to study  \"Production Mechanism and Internal Structive Studies of Exotic  Mesons\"  The principal researchers for the American side are Dr.  Chueng-Ryong Ji, Dr. Adam Szczepaniak, Dr. Stephen R. Cotanch,  and Dr. Eric S. Swanson, all of North Carolina State University.   The principal researcher for the Polish side is Dr. Leonard  Lesniak of the Institute of Nuclear Physics in Krakow.  The  recent advent of CEBAF will help researchers obtain more accurate  information on production mechanisms and the internal structure  of mesons.  The planned experiment on p(e,e'f0)p at CEBAF  especially will shed light on present speculations about the  exotic internal structure of scalar mesons.  Through this award,  the researchers will discuss two projects for the theoretical  investigation of the production mechanism and the internal  structure of mesons: (1) electroproduction and photoproduction of  scalar mesons; (2) improved constituent quark model.  The first  project will merge the expertise of the Krakow group on the  coupled channel model of scalar meson production mechanism with  the program at North Carolina State University on the meson  photo- and electro-production analyses.  They will investigate  the production mechanisms of f0,a0 and   mesons using the channel  coupling formalism of    and KK developed by the Krakow group.   In the second project, they propose to improve the existing  constituent quark models of the ordinary mesons by including some  of important QCD effects, in particular chiral symmetry breaking  and nonvalence degrees of freedom.  The aim of this project is to  construct a constituent quark model which can describe both the  ordinary mesons and the suspected exotic mesons such as scalar  mesons, glueballs and hybrid mesons.  However, at the minimum,  the researchers propose to build the model that would lead to a  spontaneous symmetry breaking and dynamically generated quark and  gluon masses and calculate the s pectra of mesons including some  of the suspected exotic mesons.     This research in physics fulfills the program objectives of  bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to  combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong  mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality,  reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.  ***",
