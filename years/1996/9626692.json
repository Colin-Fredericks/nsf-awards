 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hanson  9626692       The investigator and associates develop advanced  computational methods to solve large scale dynamic programming  problems in uncertain environments.  These methods include  parallel computation, graphical visualization, problem mapping,  memory management and data restructuring on massively parallel  and massive memory processors to solve large dimensional problems  that could not be solved by ordinary methods.  The objective is  develop fast algorithms for the optimal feedback control of  large, general, continuous time, nonlinear, stochastic dynamical  systems, perturbed by both Gaussian and distributed Poisson white  noise.  The treatment of the random jumps of Poisson processes  for modeling rare, disastrous events is a special and challenging  feature of this research.  The main application of this research  is to optimal remediation for groundwater quality in an uncertain  environment.  Other applications are to parameter uncertainty in  partially observed control systems, i.e., the dual control  problem, and to just-in-time manufacturing systems.  The  numerical approach of the investigators directly treats the  partial differential equation of stochastic dynamic programming.  New algorithms, such as spatial and state finite elements, are  used to alleviate both memory and computational demands.  Purely  parallel algorithms based on intelligent state space search are  also being developed.  The development of graphical visualization  and data management tools are essential for analyzing massive  amounts of output in many dimensions.       The investigator and associates are developing optimal  solutions to environmental and manufacturing problems when there  is some uncertainty involved.  Examples of the cause of  uncertainty in the problem are the unexpected introduction of  pollution and unknown parameters in the case of the environment,  while in the case of manufacturing an example would be the random  failure of machines.  The reason for seeking optimal solutio ns is  to minimize costs or wasting precious materials or resources.  A  large and important application that the investigator studies is  the cleanup of groundwater resources where the source of the  pollution or the underground state is uncertain.  Since polluted  groundwater sites can costs from millions to billions and more  (there are some sites for which cleanup procedures are unknown),  optimal solutions could save millions over existing sub-optimal  procedures.  Similar savings can be obtained for just-in-time  manufacturing systems that are optimally managed, enhancing our  globally competitive capabilities.  The investigator and  associates develop advanced computing techniques to compute the  optimal solutions using high performance computing, which is  essential when uncertain environments or parameters make the  amount of computation for the solution very large.  The high  performance computing involves using massive computers for fast  optimal solutions and graphical visualization to make the immense  amount of output understandable, for instance to the  environmental resource or manufacturing plant manager who would  be the prime user.",
