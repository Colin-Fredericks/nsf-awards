 "awd_abstract_narration": "9561221  Biter    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is for computer interfaces, practical finger and hand force sensors which are necessary to provide force feedback control for positioning cursors, manipulating objects, etc. since they transmit the user's hand and finger motion. Other applications range from medical applications to robotics, advanced manufacturing and virtual reality simulation; any man-machine interaction where accurate positioning is required.  Existing sensors can not satisfy these needs.  The sensors cannot be used in an array and are pressure sensors and cannot measure shear forces.  The proposed sensor array being developed can meet most of the requirement for a tactile array. It uses a magnetoelectric film with a resolution that could exceed 20 elements/inch. The sensor array under development is a totally new approach to a sensor system.  It measures the strain in a magnetrostrictive film by the coupling between the magnetic field and the magnetoelectric element.The output is an amplitude modulated signal with good dc response and high sensitivity. It can also measure shear forces but the most interesting property is the ability to matrix address the array and actually measure all elements simultaneously.    The phase I program will design, fabricate and test a sensor array suitable for the tactile interfaces to a computer. The magnetoelectric material is a new material which can be used in arrays, including ultrasonic imagers, sonar arrays, pressure mats, etc.  The proposed tactile interface will have wide use in systems that require feedback from hand motion, including robotics, smart manufacturing and numerous medical/diagnostic applications as well as computer interfaces.",
