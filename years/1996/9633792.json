 "awd_abstract_narration": "9633792  Synolakis  This action is to support the participation of U.S. researchers  in the international effort to learn from the February 17, 1996  Irian Jaya earthquake and tsunami, in order to gather and study  perishable inundation data.  The participants will join the  International Tsunami Survey Team which has surveyed six of the  1992-1994 worldwide events, resulting in a small but valuable  database of inundation data.    On February 17, 1996, a strong earthquake shook Biak Island off  Irian Jaya in East Indonesia.  The earthquake-generated tsunami  waves propagated to Japan, where the measured height of the  attenuated waves was approximately one meter, with a reported  wave height on reaching the west coast of the United States of up  to 7cm.    The US participants will: (1) measure maximum penetration points  (maximum runup) at different locations, (2) attempt to estimate  tsunami inundation velocities, and (3) interview eyewitnesses to  determine the nature and number of runup waves observed.  Runup  data are highly perishable, given that reconstruction efforts  start a few days, if not hours, after the event.  Even in remote  areas, storms and wind-generated waves may alter the topography  or scatter the debris line which is used for estimating the  location of the penetration points.  It is for this reason that  travel to the site must occur as soon as possible after the event  to document the coastal effects of a damaging tsunami.    Accurate information of the runup height distribution will allow  a better definition of the tectonic source motion, which in turn  will permit the calibration of a source model for future use.  It  is anticipated that the team will be able to obtain profile data  in the survey which will be used both to augment the modeling,  and also to evaluate how important beach topography is for first-  order predictions.  ***",
