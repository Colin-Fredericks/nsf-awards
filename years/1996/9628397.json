 "awd_abstract_narration": "Networked services are at the heart of the information revolution. This  work focuses on two characteristics of a networked service: 1)  scalability: the ability of the service to handle a large number of end  users with low per-user cost, and 2) individuality: the ability of the  service to deal with differing requirements imposed because of  heterogeneity of network paths leading to the end-users.  Although a  high level of both individuality and scalability are desirable features  of any networked service, they are normally conflicting goals that need  to be traded-off with each other. This research aims to investigate  this tradeoff from the networking infrastructure's viewpoint.      This project seeks to answer: 1) In services using multicast  communication, is it possible to add a level of individuality while  sacrificing scalability in a controlled manner?  2) In services using  unicast communication, is it possible to improve scalability while  controlling how much individuality is sacrificed?  3) Is it possible  not to require the labeling of services as unicast or multicast and  move the burden of deciding the appropriate network support to a  \"generic\" interface layer?  To answer these questions the research  seeks to develop network support mechanisms to navigate the  individuality/scalability spectrum, giving multicast services the  ability to be more individualized and unicast services the ability to  be more scalable.      The research will consist of investigating specific instances of adding  a measure of individuality to multicast services and specific instances  of making unicast services more scalable by sharing resources through  multicast and requesting batching at servers. The research will include  services such as video distribution, Web information delivery and  multimedia-on-demand (live and streamed).  The work will consider  Internet as well as ATM-style networking with some emphasis on Internet  over ATM architectures.",
