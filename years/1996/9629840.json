 "awd_abstract_narration": "9629840  HAFNER  The recent appearance of extensive regions of aridlands in southwestern North America has led many to assume that pattersn of relationships among the plants and animals adapted to these regions are also recent.  Yet many of the species are ancient, having persisted in scattered dry sites for many millions of years.  In collaborative investigations, David J. Hafner and Brett R. Riddle, together with their collaborators, will investigate the possibility of ancient structure among the regional deserts and reconstruct the sequence of divergence of these deserts.  They will examine, by means of sequence divergences in mitochondrial DNA, the genetic relationships among four groups of rodents.  These rodents are currently restricted to regional warm deserts and neighboring chaparral or thornscrub habitats, and have fossil records that indicate their presence in the study area during the early development of the regional deserts, up to 5.5 million years ago.  Relationships among these rodents will serve as indicators of relationships among other animals and plants in the deserts.    Dr. HafnerOs portion of the collaboration will involve collection and identification of the groups of rodents, which include white-footed and pocket mice, antelope ground squirrels, and kangaroo rats, targeted for examination of their mitochondrial DNA.  Expeditions will be made to up to 33 sites in the Chihuahuan, Great Basin, San Joaquin, Sonoran, and Peninsular deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, as well as the neighboring California chaparral and Sinaloan thornscrub regions, and six islands off Baja California.  The island samples are expected to provide estimates of the geographic distribution of the rodents on the Baja California peninsular mainland ca. 5,000 years ago, when the islands were separated from the peninsula.  Participants include Dr. Riddle and colleagues at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico and the Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas de Baja Californi a Sur.  The research is expected to contribute to human understanding of how species, and the distribution of species, change over time, and especially how such changes in species may be influenced by changes in the topology and climate of the regions in which the species live.",
