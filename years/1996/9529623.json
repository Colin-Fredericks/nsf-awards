 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study addresses the problem of ion-beam driven waves and their  effects on the accumulation of ionospheric plasma in the outer  plasmasphere.  This addresses a major problem in magnetospheric  physics, that is, the refilling of the plasmasphere following  geomagnetic storms.  The primary goal of the project is to firmly  establish the methodology of the following basic paradigm and  modeling approach assumes that as soon as the plasma flow  parameters cross marginal stability conditions for the waves, the  instabilities are triggered and clamp the flow near the conditions  for marginal stability.  Thus, from the waves and instability  standpoint, the quasisteady state of the plasma is known a priori.   When the macroscopic processes drive the plasma away form this  state toward instability, we know the excess momentum and the  directed kinetic energy which need to be thermalized by the  instability process.  This facilitates an easy calculation of the  anomalous plasma transport coefficients to be included in a  mesoscale model based on plasma transport equations without knowing  the details of the instabilityprocess.  This approach is termed the  Anomalous Plasma Effects or APE model.  The research strategy  consists of 1) systematic determination of easy-to-use  semiempirical relations for the marginal stability conditions for  the plasma during the refilling situation, 2) small-scale particle-  in-cell simulations to characterize plasma heating by the  instabilities and to test the APE model, and 3) mesoscale modeling  using two-stream hydrodynamic code including the anomalous  transport coefficients.",
