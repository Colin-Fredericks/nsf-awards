 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will examine the feasibility of developing an improved set of research and education modeling tools which can be used by ecologists, water resource engineers, biologists, foresters, and others in related disciplines.  These tools will help in the examination of issues such as: biological responses to climate change; carbon balance in tropical forests; agricultural productivity; water runoff, yield and quality analyses; and development of sustainable land use and forest management policies.  The conceptual models which will guide the development of these new tools are extensions of developments during the last decade in several fields, including: energetics-based ecological modeling and gradient analysis, geographic information systems applications to spatially distributed hydrometeorologic modeling, object-oriented programming methodologies, and complex data visualization.  The research objectives provide for the application of recent Object-Oriented techniques to the redesign of an integrated ecosystem model.  Successful completion of this research will produce a software design document which will then be used to improve existing models, and to determine the feasibility of generalizing the software tools for other applications.       Improved ecological modeling tools are needed by researchers, engineers, and planners.  Success of this research, followed by development of the newly designed tools, will result in a product which will find a global market among government agencies, universities, private engineering and planning firms, and ecology-oriented foundations.",
