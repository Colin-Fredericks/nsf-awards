 "awd_abstract_narration": "Devarajan Thirumalai is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational  to continue his research in statistical mechanical   treatment of protein folding and protein dynamics.   Work is proposed in   four major areas: 1) the development of simple off lattice models   representing the alpha carbons of proteins whose target native   conformations are four helix bundles; 2) molecular dynamics studies of   the effect of denaturants on the unfolding and refolding of proteins   using minimal models; 3) extension of the minimal models to more   realistic models that include the effects of side chains that can be used   to model real proteins; and 4) use of instantaneous normal modes to   characterize the rugged landscape of protein potential energy surfaces,   and to further characterize the protein dynamics and optimal reaction   pathways using these techniques.  This theoretical approach will provide the basic understanding of the   folding properties of protein.  This problem is currently at the frontier   of protein research, and a basic understanding of the factors that   influence protein folding will have an enormous impact on the   biotechnology industry.",
