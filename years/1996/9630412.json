This  increased strength in binding, also known as affinity,  results from changes, or mutations, in the genes that code  for the antibodies.  Although not yet definitively shown, it  is believed that this model also applies to the immune  response to more complex molecules including proteins which  are present on microorganisms that the immune system  normally eliminates.  In this study, this model will be  extended to the immune response to a protein that has been  well-characterized both structurally and chemically,  cytochrome c.  In preliminary work it has been determined  that several mutations in the genes encoding antibodies  specific for cytochrome c do occur after immunizing mice  with the protein and that together these mutants result in  higher affinity antibody binding.  Now, the effect of each  of the mutations in the antibody genes on the affinity will  be tested by altering the genes at each of the several sites  independently.  In addition, the structure of a complex of  an antibody bound to the protein will be determined using  the technique of X-ray crystallography to find out whether  the mutations cause changes in the antibodies that directly  contact the target molecule (antigen) or whether the effects  are indirect.  The cytochrome c to be employed in this study  is a protein expressed in mice.  Previously it was found  that the antibody genes used in the immune response to this  self antigen are also used in response to a related protein  and that during the response the antibodies acquire higher  affinity for this protein than for the self antigen.  In  this study, the mutations in the antibody genes that allo w  for this conversion will be determined.  It has been  suggested for a long time that this may be a general  mechanism for immunological recognition of foreign antigens  but an experimental system to study it has been available.  In summary, this study will extend our understanding of  affinity maturation in the antibody response from what was  previously known in studies of model compounds to a more  complex, protein antigen.  It will also provide further  insight into how immune recognition of foreign antigens may  initiate with the response of antibody-producing white blood  cells that possibly evolved to recognize self antigens.  ***",
