 "awd_abstract_narration": "Freshwater ecologists in the U.S.A. have long emphasized the  study of lentic and small lotic ecosystems; and as a  consequence, research has rarely been conducted on large  rivers.  Indeed, about 96% of all lotic studies have  involved headwater creeks to a few medium-sized rivers,  despite the fact that big rivers are perhaps the most  crucial, surface-water ecosystem for humans throughout the  world in terms of water supply and transport.  Although  aquatic ecologists generally acknowledge that much more  research is needed on large rivers, this has been difficult  to accomplish because of: (a) major logistical problems and  expenses associated with large river research: (b)  inadequate foundation data on which to base sophisticated  research proposals to funding agencies (especially NSF; and  (c) the severe shortage of field stations on large rivers as  operational centers for research and sites for long-term  environmental monitoring to support descriptive,  theoretical, and experimental studies.    The University of Louisville recently purchased riverfront  property located approximately one hour from the main campus  (upstream from Louisville in Westport, KY) on which to  establish the Ohio River Environmental Station (ORES) and  has received a gift from a national corporation to aid in  the renovation or construction of research facilities.  The  institution wishes to make ORES a preeminent site for large  river research on regional, national, and international  levels, especially as the research relates to management of  navigable regulated rivers.  ORES is located at an ideal  site where the Ohio changes from a river with a naturally-  constricted channel to a fllodplain river.    To further these goals, this project will support planning  and design of ORES.  The project will sponsor a workshop at  the University of Louisville to (1) refine the mission of  ORES; (2) discuss the organization, physical design, and  equipping of ORES; and (3) develop plans for the  establishment and impl ementation of an international  consortium of large river laboratories and field stations.  Three faculty members from the Biology Department at the  University of  Louisville will join 5 aquatic ecologists  from other North American universities and 2 aquatic  scientists from overseas research laboratories at this  workshop.  Based on additional information gathered by the  P.I. and advice from participants in the workshop, the  master site plan, mission, and strategic objectives of ORES  will be finalized.  The University of Louisville will then  contract with an architectural firm for the final design of  the Ohio River Environmental Station site and buildings.",
