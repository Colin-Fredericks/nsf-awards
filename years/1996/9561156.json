 "awd_abstract_narration": "This small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses a rapid prototyping procedure for new products which incorporate microprocessor technology.  Today, development of each new microprocessor controlled product involves custom design of both hardware and software, in many cases duplicating functionality previously implemented in earlier products.  This process of re-inventing much that has already been done often requires an extended R&D cycle and unnecessarily large costs.  An alternative to this approach to prototyping is designated Computer Alded Prototyping (CAP).  Phase I research will configure a new product prototype with proven hardware and proven software using a personal computer click-and-drag scheme as the configuration tool.  Unique hardware design, unique software design, and unique merging concepts will be studied.  The result will be a practical CAP concept.        The CAP concept is expected to make a drastic reduction in the cost and time required to prototype a new product.  No longer would it be necessary for teams of engineers and programmers to spend months or years designing, coding, compiling, and debugging prototypes.  Technicians trained in the CAP Procedure will be able to use a PC to build a working prototype in a matter of days or weeks.  CAP would find wide commercial use in the electronics industry in that virtually every such product contains a microprocessor chip.  Other potential arenas of application include, but are not limited to, medical devices, office equipment, and manufacturing processes and control.",
