 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  project  is  the developing and implementing  (at  Michigan  Technological  University  and Arizona State  University)  course  materials  for  an improved undergraduate number  theory  course.  This  new  course incorporates many of the ideas and  innovations  that  have  been  successfully employed  in  earlier  mathematics  education  reform projects.  New features to be  integrated  into  the  course are: the use of guided discovery as the primary  mode  of  student  learning;  the  use  of  Mathematica  to  facilitate  numerical experimentation; collaboration between students to work  on  forming and investigating conjectures; a diminished  emphasis  on lectures; and, student lab reports detailing results that have  been  obtained.  The target audience for the proposed  course  is  preservice  secondary  mathematics  teachers,  who  comprise  the  majority of students in the course. During the first year of  the  project,  all materials for the proposed course will be prepared:  pre-lab   worksheets   and   homework  assignments;   Mathematica  notebooks; documents to be distributed to students that  describe  the  nature of the course and expectations for lab reports;  and,  an instructor's guide to assist in implementation at other sites.  All  materials  will be free and available to interested  parties  via anonymous ftp.",
