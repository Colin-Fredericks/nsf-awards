 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr.  Alan Stone, Department of Geography and Environmental Engineering,   Johns Hopkins University, is supported through  the Chemistry Division   and through the Earth Sciences Division by the Environmental Geochemistry   and Biogeochemistry program to support young scientist participation in   the 1996 Environmental Sciences Water Gordon Conference entitled   `Interaction of Chemical and Biological Processes` on June 23-28, 1996 in   New Hampton, New Hampshire. The objective of this conference is to   highlight important new findings stemming from collaborative efforts   among chemists, biologists, physical scientists, and engineers   collaborating on studies of environmental processes involving nutrient   uptake and elemental cycling, pollutant effects and transformations, and   biochemical and physiological responses to environmental change.  This conference will provide an opportunity for young scientists working   in an important area of environmental science to share their results and   experiences in the field.  It is a multidisciplinary conference with   participants from a broad range of scientific and engineering   disciplines, and it will likely foster new collaborations and the   development of integrated, multidisciplinary approaches to critical   environmental issues.",
