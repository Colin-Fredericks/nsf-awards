 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose an Undergraduate Faculty Enhancement project that will  provide for each of the next two years, an intense twelve-day  laboratory short course in Molecular Genetics & Evolutionary  Biology in the summer with a 4-day follow-up session each January,  and on-going technical and material support.  A highly successful  established format that evolved from ten prior national Chautauqua  courses was used in the design and development of our proposed  Undergraduate Faculty Enhancement project.  Twenty-two faculty will  be selected each year from a national applicant pool comprised of  faculty from community colleges, 4-year liberal arts colleges and  universities, comprehensive universities, and research  universities.  Participants will learn the fundamentals of  molecular biology through the presentation of lectures and  demonstrations, and they will also conduct a series of experiments  to develop skill in PCR amplification, restriction enzyme analysis,  and various gel separation techniques.  In research groups of 4-5  composed of a mix faculty from community colleges and four-year  institutions, the participants will investigate \"thematic\" research  projects.  Seminar speakers will discuss their research on  procaryote, vertebrate, invertebrate, and plant systems, and their  application of molecular techniques.  Faculty will implement the  molecular techniques that they learn by adapting the exercises from  the course into undergraduate laboratory courses at their  respective institutions.  Trained faculty will have gained the  extraordinary capabilities afforded by these techniques to access  the genomes of natural populations from any taxa on earth and thus  create unique laboratory curricula at their own institutions.  The  SFSU faculty and Instructional Support Technician will support  participants after the summer course in the incorporation of  molecular techniques and analysis in undergraduate instruction.   Participants will also develop skill and confidence with molecular  techn iques to use in their research.  The workshop will be used to  develop laboratory modules and exercises for use in primary and  secondary education.",
