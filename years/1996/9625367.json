 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic   Chemistry Program supports research on transition metal quinoline   complexes by Dr. Edward Rosenberg of the Chemistry Department, University   of Montana.  First, the synthesis and mechanism of carbon-carbon   bond-forming during nucleophilic addition to transition metal-activated   quinolines will be investigated.  Some triosmium quinoline complexes   undergo nucleophilic addition regio- and stereoselectively at the   5-position of the quinoline ring.  This reaction will be exploited for   potential applications in organic synthesis.  Carbon-nitrogen bond   cleavage in quinoline derivatives complexed to polymetallic sites will   also be studied.  The products of successive hydrogenations will be   determined.  In a third project, kinetic isotope methods will be used to   determine factors controlling hydrogen transfer to and from metals in   stoichiometric and catalytic processes.  Proton barrier tunneling will be   considered as a possible pathway.    This project is relevant to catalysis, natural product synthesis, and   fuels upgrading.  New methods for forming carbon bonds to quinoline could   be applicable to the synthesis of neurotransmitter agonists or cytotoxic   compounds. Investigation of the behavior of carbon-nitrogen bonds during   hydrogenation may provide insight into the hydrodenitrogenation catalysis   reaction, which is important to the petroleum industry.",
