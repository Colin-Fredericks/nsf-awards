 "awd_abstract_narration": "A parallel two-dimensional memory (i.e., one that stores and retrieves 2D  pages (arrays) of digital data) represents a fundamentally different memory  architecture. This 2D parallel architecture has the potential for capacity  and speed performance which is orders of magnitude beyond the expected  physical limits of traditional lD storage architectures.  A volume optical  memory is a system which stores data pages within a three dimensional  optical medium.  These systems have the potential combination of large  storage capacity (> 10^l2 bits/cm^3), high speed random access via massless  scanning (<10 ns), and very large data transfer rates (> 10^10 bits/sec)  owing to the 2D storage/retrieval of data.. Direct application of  conventional communication theoretic techniques to 2D parallel memories is  complicated by the truly 2D nature of the data format. In addition, a  volume optical memory implementation typically results in a storage channel  with very complex noise and interference. Factors contributing to the  operating environment include (I) the intensity transformation and  subsequent spatial averaging of the coherent optical signal as a result of  optoelectronic conversion, (ii) non Gaussian noise sources such as shot and  speckle, and (iii) complex data dependent interference sources such as  inter-page crosstalk and space variant intersymbol interference within a  given page.  This research program is concerned with signaling,  equalization, and decision schemes as they apply to parallel 2D data  channels, with specific consideration given to coherent (holographic)  volume optical memory systems. One objective of this research program is to  develop the theoretical foundation for signaling and detection in 2D  digital communication systems. Another objective is the application of this  theory to develop robust, implementable signaling and detection techniques  for volume optical memory systems.  The plan for achieving these objectives  is based on the development of relatively simple  models of the volume  optical memory system to be used for development and analysis of specific  signaling and detection algorithms. Performance bounds for the optimal  detection strategies, as well as efficient algorithms for their  realization, will be sought in the data detection phase of the research.  Simple, suboptimal data detectors which exploit the 2D nature of the data  format will also be developed and their performance characterized relative  to that of the optimal detection rule. The signal design component will be  concerned with error correction coding for use with 2D asymmetric channels,  precoding techniques for combating data-dependent interference within and  between pages, pixel profile optimization using simple optical masks, and  novel signaling strategies for non-Gaussian channels. The third component  involves the creation of a sophisticated simulation engine for the  evaluation and refinement of new signaling and detection methods. This  simulation engine will capture the detailed physical characteristics of  volume optical memory systems and will facilitate measuring the performance  and robustness of these novel 2D approaches in a real-world environment.",
