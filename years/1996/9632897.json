 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program of the Chemistry Division,   Professor Peter P. Gaspar of Washington University (St. Louis) will study   highly reactive species containing electron-deficient main group atoms.    This is a renewal of Award CHE-9108130.  Recent past work led to   discovery of ways to make the novel electron deficient carbene analogs,   phosphinidenes (RP), representing formally monovalent phosphorus, and   Gaspar's group has been involved in silylene chemistry for many years.   This project  will involve attempts to generate highly reactive species   with electron deficiency on diverse atoms: silylenes, germylenes,   stannylenes, borylenes, and aluminylidenes.  The project will extend the   mechanistic ideas of organic chemistry to the prediction and   rationalization of bond-making and bond-breaking processes across the   periodic table. Other new species such as germenes and phosphinidene   chalcogenides will provide mechanistic insight and, potentially,   synthetic utility.  Organic chemistry has a rich history of detailed study of highly reactive   species, which are intermediates in many chemical reactions, and of using   such studies to predict new and useful chemistry.  This project will   examine a series of related highly energetic and reactive species   involving atoms not traditionally considered part of the organic   chemist's repertoire.  It will use the rationales of organic chemistry to   extend our understanding of details of chemical behavior into many other   regions of the periodic table.",
