 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622802  Yang        The objective of this project is to study the propagation and   interaction of optical pulses in birefringent nonlinear optical fibers.  In such fibers, nonlinearity, dispersion and birefringence all play an  important role, and the pulse evolution can be modelled mathematically   by two coupled nonlinear Schroedinger equations. In this project, we   will study the propagation of such pulses by examining the solution   properties of these coupled equations. In particular, we will thoroughly   investigate the internal oscillations, radiation and interaction of these   pulses. A combination of analytical and numerical methods will be used.   The analytical methods include Hirota's method and the perturbation methods.   Hirota's method will be used to study the interaction behaviors of the   optical pulses. The perturbation methods will be used to study their   internal oscillations and radiation. The numerical methods will be used to   check the analytical results as well as to deal with cases where analytical   methods are not appropriate. The proposed research will provide theoretical   guidance to the design of the fast-speed fiber-optic telecommunication   systems. In addition, it will develop new analytical methods for studying   non-integrable wave systems.     %%%        This project will study the propagation and interaction of optical   pulses in birefringent nonlinear optical fibers. It is motivated by the  ongoing experiments on high-speed fiber-optic telecommunication systems using  solitonian pulses as information bits. It will address some basic theoretical   questions arising in the design of such telecommunication systems. For  instance, it will study the stability and degradation of pulse signals  travelling along the optical fibers. Its results will contribute to the   realization of the underlying new communication systems which could   revolutionize the whole field of long-distance information transmission.   ***",
