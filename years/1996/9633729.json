 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to study, design and evaluate control mechanisms for  time-multiplexing optical interconnection networks in multiprocessor  applications.  Such mechanisms decouple the relatively slow network control from  the high optical data transmission bandwidth. The research will assess the  advantages, capabilities and limitations of time-division multiplexing.  Specifically, models will be developed to specify the communication requirements  of applications, to express and measure the communication locality present in  communication loads, and to estimate the communication cost in multiplexed  interconnection networks.  Different control protocols will be simulated and  tested on traces collected from actual parallel applications, and on synthetic  traces generated with the help of the communication locality model. Centralized,  distributed and pipelined control strategies will be implemented and compared.    This project is motivated by several observations. First, without multiplexing,  the control overhead of establishing end-to-end connections in a network may be  prohibitive. Second, applications exhibit communication locality which amplifies  the benefits of multiplexing. Third, the high bandwidth of optical paths allows  for multiplexing with minimal effect on the transmission rate on individual  connections.  Finally, the nature of massively parallel programs allows compilers  to determine, with current technology, the multiplexing sequences that satisfy  most of the communication requirements.",
