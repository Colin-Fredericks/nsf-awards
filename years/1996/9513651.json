 "awd_abstract_narration": "To study motion in natural settings, especially out of doors, a  battery-powered weather proof two-camera video system and computer  analysis system are developed. In the data collection system each  camera is oriented and focused by a human operator. The cameras will be  able to pan and zoom so that a subject can be easily followed. Other  systems designed to study  biological motion require that the orientation of the cameras be fixed,  but here the pan and tilt angles measured by two optical shaft encoders  (resolution 0.036 degrees) and zoom factor (measured by a linear shaft  encoder) are stored at video frame rates (30 Hz) on the image in bar  code. The two video images are synchronized in time by genlocking the  cameras and mixing the same SMPTE time code with each video signal.        The image processing system is consists of a RISC workstation  that runs software to decode the pan and tilt angles of the cameras and  the time code. In addition, the software can compute the pixel  coordinates of the center of mass of multiple objects in each video  frame. The object recognition software was designed by Dr. Jack  Sanders-Reed of SVS Inc. and was originally used at weapons test  ranges. It features modules for pixel processing, background clutter  suppression, object detect and description, and frame to frame  tracking.        The camera angles and pixel coordinates of the center of mass of  the objects from both cameras are used to compute the position of the  objects in three-dimensional space as a function of time. From this  basic information other important performance characteristics such as  velocity, acceleration and turning radius and the distance between  different objects can be computed. The new image analysis techniques  will help automate the processing of video images, which if done  manually is a time intensive activity.        A series of collaborative experiments with 15 other scientists is  designed to test the usefulness and versatility of the system for the  study of a nimal locomotion, animal behavior and conservation biology  under field conditions. This instrumentation greatly increases our  ability to quantify motion and behavior outdoors. It will provide  flexibility in data gathering and power for image analysis that no  commercial motion analysis system can match.",
