 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thomas Beck, University of Cincinnati, is funded by a grant from the   Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his work in   the use of multigrid methods for simulations of complex materials.  Beck   will continue his development of multigrid methods for solving the   Kohn-Sham equations of density functional theory and the Poisson   electrostatic equation.   New algorithms will be developed for use on   massively parallel computers such as the Cray T3D.  Once the methods have   been developed test computations will be carried out on small molecules   and periodic lattice systems for direct comparison with existing ab   initio and plane wave computations.   Applications include: 1)   calculations involving the chemical binding of sulfur compounds on gold   surfaces; and 2) Monte Carlo simulations to compute thermodynamic   information in hydrogen and hydrogen/helium plasmas at high pressures not   available to experiment.    Understanding chemical processes at the molecular level requires a   quantum treatment to accurately describe chemical bonds and   rearrangements occuring in complex condensed phase environments.    Existing algorithms for studying these processes have been limited both   by the inherent difficulties in such calculations and by the scaling   properties of the methods.  The multigrid methods being pursued by Beck   offer promising alternatives to more traditional electronic structure   approaches due to their rigorous linear scaling capabilities and   computational flexibility.",
