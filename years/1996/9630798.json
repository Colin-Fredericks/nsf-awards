 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630798  Schultz         Because   they   cannot   move,   plants   often   must   respond  simultaneously  to  many different environmental  stresses.   The  investigator suggests that responses to one stimulus  are  likely  to  condition  responses  to others.  Wind  provides  a  stimulus  experienced to a greater or lesser degree by all plants. Evidence  suggests  that plant responses to wind or touch involve  many  of  the same or similar mechanisms seen in plant responses to insects  and diseases.  Naturalists frequently report that plant pests are  scarce  on  windy, exposed sites, and 'natural' gardeners  sweep,  brush,  or  shake  plants to enhance hardiness.   The  mechanisms  behind these observations have not been determined.    The  proposed research will link plant responses to such physical  stimuli with resistance to insects and disease.  Bean plants  and  oak seedlings exposed to wind (fans) and shaking will be examined  for  biochemical changes related to tolerating such stresses  and  resisting pests.  Preliminary evidence indicates that biochemical  changes will indeed occur that can enhance pest resistance.  This  link will be confirmed by exposing treated and control plants  to  pests  in  the  laboratory  and in the field,  to  determine  the  significance  of  wind as a \"protective\" stimulus  under  natural  conditions.    This work provides the first real evidence of enhanced resistance  to  pests  by physical stimuli, and tests fundamental  hypotheses  about the generality of plant responses to environmental cues and  the  organization of such responses.  We foresee  many  potential  applications  of  this work, from enhancing  pest  resistance  in  cultivated   plants,  to  identifying  constraints  and   optimal  strategies in bioengineering or breeding superior cultivars.",
