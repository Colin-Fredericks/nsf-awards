The objective of this award is to improve  the ability of models to simulate large changes in the earth system  and to understand the interactions and feedbacks among components  of the system.  The earth's climate system with its vegetation,  lakes, wetlands, and oceans has changed dramatically in the past,  and the data about these large changes provide \"ground truth\" for  testing the accuracy of the earth system models.  The research team  will develop an integrated equilibrium biosphere model, a  lake/continental-hydrology model, and coupling procedures to link  these models off-line to atmospheric general circulation models and  an ocean general circulation model.  A regional fine-mesh climate  model will also be used for studying earth system changes in  regions of complex topography.  With these coupled models, it will  be possible to explore a wide variety of potential earth system  feedbacks including: a) atmosphere-biosphere interactions  associated with boreal forest replacing tundra, or tropical  savannah replacing desert; b) atmosphere/land-surface-hydrology  interactions associated with increases or decreases in the area  extend of lakes and wetlands; atmosphere/ocean/terrestrial-  vegetation interactions associated with changes in Arctic sea-ice,  the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation, and coastal and  equatorial upwelling.  Global paleovegetation and lake status data  sets will be compiled for 6000 and 21,000 years ago, and these data  sets will be used along with data for ocean circulation and from  the previous intergalcial to make comparisons with the coupled  earth system models.",
