 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory (SNARL) is a  field station of the University of California, Santa Barbara  (UCSB), located in the eastern Sierra Nevada.  The station  is one of the most used and scientifically productive sites  in the University of California's Natural Reserve System  (NRS).  SNARL supports the full gamut of year-round field  research in habitats ranging from alpine watersheds to  alkali lakes, old growth forests to experimental streams.  This project will create an office building and database  center at SNARL.  The center will make use of a recently  acquired building that has been moved to the site and is  being renovated.  The project will also support the creation  of the database center which will provide 1) networked  computers and peripherals for field station users, 2)  Geographic Information System (GIS) software and databases,  3) Global Positioning System (GPS) hardware and software, 4)  a dedicated Internet connection, and 5) staff to develop and  support research with emphasis on spatially-related data  sets.    The project will provide new opportunities for field  scientists to process and analyze data while \"in the field.\"  The telecommunications link will allow visiting scientists  to stay in contact with staff and colleagues and to move  data back and forth from the field station to their home  institution.  The ability to move and store large data  files, such as remote sensing images, will be part of this  project.  There is substantial demand for the additional  space and proposed facilities and equipment.  Database  development and management will be emphasized to improve the  support for researchers at the field station.  National and  international access to these data sets will be available  via the Internet.",
