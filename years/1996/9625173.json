 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625173  McClamroch    This proposal describes a plan for research on stabilization of  an equilibrium solution of an important class of nonlinear  control systems.  Although supervisory or logic-based switched  feedback controllers have been studied in a variety of contexts,  our interest is to exploit them to achieve closed loop  stabilization when alternative smooth feedback stabilization  approaches are either not available or do not provide the  required performance.  We plan to study stabilization of a  special but important class of nonlinear control systems, that  include nonholonomic control systems and related nonlinear  control systems as a subclass, using supervisory control.  Our  motivation arises from the fact that nonholonomic control systems   are well known not to be asymptotically stabilizable using smooth  (time invariant) feedback. Fundamental research questions are  posed whose solution should provide important new insights into  nonlinear stabilization and control using supervisory control  feedback. The proposed theoretical research will be carried out  in connection with a parallel study of applications of  supervisory feedback control, primarily to classes of  underactuated mechanical systems. The outcomes of the proposed  research should contribute to the synthesis of classical  nonlinear control methodology and intelligent control methodology.  ***",
