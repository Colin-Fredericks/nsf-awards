The success of these gatherings can be  attributed to the quality of the conferees and the  philosophical format.    The COSU series has provided an excellent international  forum to review and discuss the latest technological  advances, concepts, and research needs on a variety of  interdisciplinary topics.  Inasmuch as more than 50 percent  of the world's population and industrial and research  activity is located within 100 kilometers of the coast, this  is a very important region on which to focus in applying  advances in marine science and technology to achieve  sustainable development of the coastal infrastructure.  These symposia has been held in specific coastal regions of  the world to obtain different perspectives and thus  stimulate the cross-pollination of ideas for solving the  many environmental and developmental problems facing these  areas.    These gatherings have provided new insights and innovative  concepts to deal with the interdisciplinary problems of the  expanding coastal infrastructure, which are driven by the  steadily increasing coastal population with its attendant  environmental, social, and economic impacts.  Concepts  frequently introduced pertain to such topics as artificial  islands, floating cities, environmentally friendly coastal  reclamation, new ocean energy extraction techniques, off-  shore ranching, artificial upwelling, autonomous vehicles,  and remote sensing systems, to mention a few.  Various  international cooperative projects have already resulted.    There is great emphasis on sustainable coastal development,  i.e., development in harmony with the marine environment.  This has introduced new technologies, methods, and  techni ques that have greatly influenced the design of those  systems and projects comprising the coastal infrastructure.  ***",
