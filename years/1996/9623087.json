 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623087  Caflisch    This proposal is for development of analytical and computational methods   for describing singularities in the solutions of partial differential equations   (PDEs), and for application of those methods to problems of fluid   mechanics and other physical systems. The key step in the analysis is    transformation of the variables of the PDE to obtain an \"unfolded\" system,   the solutions of which are non-singular. This will be used for vortex sheets,   swirling flow,  magnetohydrodynamics and crystal patterns.  For these   problems we will attempt to find singular solutions and to classify their   generic type.    This proposal is for research on \"singularities\" in physics and engineering   problems.  Singularities are points at which the measurable quantities in the   system change abruptly or become very large.  An important example,   which is a main focus of this project is the development of very large   rotational velocity in a fluid such as air or liquid.  These singularities are   believed to be a primary cause of turbulence, an important but poorly  understood phenomena in many applications.  The goals of this research   project are to find these singularities, classify their possible behavior and   use them to gain understanding of turbulence and other problems.",
