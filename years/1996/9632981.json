 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632981  Kostuk  The increasing demands on interconnects for network switching and  multiprocessor backplanes is forcing consideration of advanced electrical  and nonelectrical solutions, such as optical interconnects. Electrical  backplanes have been demonstrated at data rates of 500 MHz for 64 bit wide  buses with point-to-point connections over distances of 0.5 m (i.e. Cray  T-90). Optics can increase the performance of such systems by providing  higher bandwidths over long transmission distances, and support  architectures requiring fanout and fanin. Another important performance  consideration is system cost. The Cray electrical backplane is expensive  because it requires non-conventional electronic switching elements and  packaging methods. If optics is to prove useful, the cost of its devices  and packaging must be lower than electrical alternatives.    Many research groups have concentrated on developing optical interconnect  architectures and optoelectronic devices. However, micro optic interconnect  systems and cost reducing fabrication methods are not very well developed.  The purpose of this proposal is to advance the state of micro optic system  development by implementing optical interconnect modules for two important  interconnect applications: 1) backplane networks, and 2) multistage  switching systems. Both systems utilize free-space micro diffractive optic  components to increase routing functionality over short connection  distances while maintaining acceptable alignment tolerances. The free-space  optics module for the backplane application provides an efficient parallel  interface between vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) arrays and  a long distance fiber distribution network. This allows the backplane to  extend from the intra machine to inter machine levels for parallel  processing tasks. The optics modules for multistage switching systems are  suitable for interfacing to both VCSEL and CMOS-SEED modulator smart pixel  array systems. The proposed free-space op tics modules reduce the complexity  of earlier optical system designs by eliminating the requirement for  polarization optics and increases the optical transfer efficiency. This  should increase the bandwidth at which these systems can operate.    In addition to designing and fabricating these optical interface modules we  are planning to work with Donnelly Corporation to apply their injection  molding techniques to replicate the optical components and packaging  mounts. This should further reduce the cost of implementing these systems.  A collaboration with the University of Colorado is also planned to  incorporate our optics module for the multistage switching system in their  intelligent backplane architecture.  ***",
