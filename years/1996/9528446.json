 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Heasley at   Point Loma Nazarene College will investigate the mechanisms associated   with the halogenation of humic acids. In this study, various phenols will   be used as models for humic acids. Phenolic residues are known to be   building blocks of humic acids. This problem presents itself because it   is common practice to purify drinking water supplies by halogenation.   With regard to humic acids, which are present in nearly all water   supplies, halogenation yields toxic products rather than the desired   non-toxic products. This research is intended to elaborate the mechanisms   of this process so as to facilitate methodologies to counter the   undesirable reaction.  All to often procedures implemented to take care of one problem create   problems in another sector which compromise the entire methodology. In   this case, drinking water is purified with the oxidant,  halogen. While   this is effective for destroying many toxic contaminants, it converts   other substances such as humic acids to toxins. In this research, the   undesired reaction will be investigated with the goal of averting the   toxic product formation during the drinking water purification procedure.   This investigation has potential significant impact on an environmentally   sensitive health issue.",
