 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding is requested to purchase a multi-processor computer  based  on  the RISC architecture to replace the Convex C220.  The  projects  for which the requested equipment will be used include:  Computer  Simulations  of  Solvated Proteins  and  Liquids  (R.M.  Levy),  Computer Simulations of Double Helical DNA (W.K.  Olson),  Biomolecular Structure and Interactions (H. M. Berman), Potential  Surfaces  for  Internal  Rotation  in  Conjugated  Molecules  (L.  Goodman), Medium Effects in Electronic Structure Calculations (K.  Krogh-Jespersen), NMR Structure Determination and Protein Folding  (J.  Baum),  and  Structure  and Interactions  of  Macromolecular  Complexes   (M.  Georgiadis).  The  need  for  the   RISC   based  multi-processor is based on the computationally intensive  nature  of  these  projects,  and the need for the visualization  of  the  computed results concerning complex biomolecular systems.          Rutgers  University is internationally recognized  for  the  strength  of  its  research program in Biophysical  Chemistry.  A  central theme connecting the investigators participating in  this  proposal  is  that of \"Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics\".  The  complexity and sheer size of biological macromolecules makes  the  analysis of the structural and dynamic features in these  systems  computationally  intensive.  This is  true  for  the  theoretical  studies  including  molecular modeling using  computer  graphics,  computer  simulations  of biomolecules in  solution  and  quantum  chemical  calculations of electronic properties  of  biomolecules  and  conjugated molecules. This is also true of the  experimental  techniques  that are represented in the proposal:  macromolecular  x-ray   crystallography  and  NMR  spectroscopy.  The  individual  projects  carried  out by the coinvestigators  all  involve  very  large scale computations.         The shared computational facilities for molecular biophysics  and  computational  chemistry  are housed  primarily  within   the  chemistry department. The backbone of the computational resources  for  biophysical chemistry is the Convex C220 dual processor.  In  1986  a Convex Cl uniprocessor was purchased with funding from  a  National  Institutes of Health Shared Instrumentation  Grant.  In  1989, with funding provided by an instrumentation grant from  the  National Science Foundation and by Rutgers University, the Convex  was  upgraded  to  a  dual processor C220. At  the  time  of  its  purchase,  the  vector  architecture  of  the  Convex  was  quite  remarkable, providing 10-50 times the performance gains over  the  DEC VAX 780 hardware which it replaced. In the context of today's  computing  environment, with the availability  of  RISC  computer  workstations,  the  performance  of  the  Convex  is  much   less  impressive.  At  present, perhaps the only  remaining  remarkable  attributes of the Convex are its sheer physical size,  its  power  requirements, and exhorbitant maintenance costs.         We propose to replace the Convex C220 with a multi-processor  RISC computer system. A final choice of vendor will be made after  competitive  evaluations of alternative RISC systems  is  carried  out  after  the  grant  award. Possible vendors  include  Silicon  Graphics,  Hewlett  Packard, IBM and DEC. At this  time,  we  are  seriously  considering the Silicon Graphics Power Onyx  primarily  because  of  its  cost effective floating point performance,  but  also  because  of its graphics features. Our proposed  budget  is  based  on  the  purchase of an SGI Power Onyx system  with  eight  R8000  90  Mhz  processors, 2 GByte high density memory,  Reality  Engine graphics hardware, and 64 GBytes of magnetic disk storage.",
