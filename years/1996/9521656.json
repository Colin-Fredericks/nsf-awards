 "awd_abstract_narration": "Western Washington University's Shannon Point Marine Center  (SPMC) is strategically located, providing direct acces from  the mainland to a wide variety of marine and estuarine  habitats that support a rich and diverse marine biota.  The  location and facilities provide distinctive opportunities  for process-oriented research on productivity of coastal  watersheds and wetlands, nutrient cycling and regeneration,  microbial ecology, and benthic metabolism and on life  history phenomena of local fish, inverterbrates, and  macrophytes.   To promote research and training in these  topics, SPMC has developed a database and has established  three model study sites to support long-term research.  Recent facilities development has emphasized the analytical  base.  Analysis of SPMC's field support facilities has  revealed fundamental weakness in research vessel capacity  and in the ability to support SCUBA.  Such weakness is  restricting research and, if not addressed, will limit  SPMC's capacity to respond to growing interest in use of its  facilities by students and scientists.  This project will  support the purchase of a 22' shallow draft research vessel  that will permit access to very shallow areas that typify  our model study sites.  Additionally, the project will  support the purchase of a dive support vessel and renovation  of space to provide a dive locker and compressor.",
