 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612549  Winters  The long-term objective of this project is to establish a closer  relationship of collaboration between the Catholic University of  America (CUA) and the Delft University of Technology (DUT) in the  Netherlands.  Many of the research interests of the Man-Machine  Systems Group at DUT and the Biomedical Engineering Program at  CUA are similar and complementary to each other.  This  complementarity is a natural incentive for both groups to expand  interaction, and to establish more formal collaboration.    The proposed bidirectional collaboration between the universities  is envisioned to include the development of sister facilities for  in-depth biomechanical and neuromotor study of the human  shoulder, and a continuing exchange program of students and  researchers from both institutions.  The research universities,  CUA and DUT, provide engineering expertise, while corresponding  clinical expertise is provided by the National Rehabilitation  Hospital in Washington, DC and the University Hospital in Leiden,  the Netherlands.  The two facilities would have the capability of  collecting and analyzing data for the same battery of shoulder  function tests.    Another important component of the project is the proposed  student exchange program.  In the first exchange, a doctoral  student at CUA will spend several months with the Dutch Shoulder  Group (comprised of DUT and two other Dutch universities).  The  student will document DUT's procedures and methodologies, and  participate in the research activities of the Shoulder Group.  Upon returning to CUA, the student will spend several weeks  helping to replicate the Dutch capabilities at CUA, and to  coordinate subsequent research plans.  During the second year,  the principal investigator and a student will return to Delft for  two weeks to share findings, refine common methodologies, and  plan future activities.  Two doctoral students from DUT will also  conduct short-term research at CUA.    The expanded scientific collaboration b etween CUA and DUT will be  beneficial to both institutions and to the field of biomedical  engineering as a whole.  Some of the more outstanding benefits  include intellectual development of researchers at both  institutions, advancement of research projects, and the resulting  increase in knowledge for the wider community of biomedical  professionals, with its concomitant potential improvements in  health care.  ***",
