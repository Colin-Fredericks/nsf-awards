 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623599  Gale    This CAREER program focuses on research with closely linked  educational activities related to joining of intermetallic  compounds to conventional nickel-base superalloys. Transient  liquid phase (TLP) bonding is examined as a technique for  bonding structural intermetallics since it is tolerant of  limited low temperature ductility and stable oxide formation  often exhibited by such alloy systems.  The research aims to  elucidate the mechanisms controlling processing structure  property relationships in nickel aluminide/superalloy joints  and thereby demonstrate routes for improved microstructural  control.  The formulation of suitable process modeling tools  are a vital part of the research. A difficulty often  encountered by students is establishing interconnections in  terms of shared and linked concepts between different  aspects of science. The educational part of the program  develops an educational module on intermetallic alloy to  superalloy joining that illustrates key aspects of materials  science with appropriate emphasis on microstructural  development, materials processing, mechanical properties,  kinetics and thermodynamics.  This module will include  multimedia teaching resources and inclass demonstrations.  %%%  The field of intermetallic compounds constitutes a major  research activity both within the  US and worldwide.  Suitable methodologies are needed for initial fabrication  and post service repair.  The joining of intermetallics to  conventional materials, such as superalloys, is particularly  important as intermetallics are likely to be used locally  within engineering systems composed predominantly of such  materials.  ***",
