 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order for compilers of fine-grain parallel architectures to be  as effective as possible, compiler writers must understand the  interactions between the phases of the compiler. These phases  include instruction scheduling which rearranges code in order to  increase available fine-grain parallelism.  In addition, code  transformations to increase memory performance are applied, such  as tiling and loop interchange to increase cache performance,  prefetching to prefetch values from memory in order to eliminate  the memory latency, and scalar replacement which changes array  references to scalar references to decrease memory accesses. The  compiler also performs register allocation, which allocates  registers to values so as to minimize the number of memory  accesses.    The goal of this proposed work is to investigate the interactions  of these phases. This effort is being undertaken along two  directions. The first direction is to continue previous work in  cooperative register allocation and instruction scheduling by  (1) incorporating cooperative software pipelining and performing  the cooperative register allocation and scheduling optimizations  over a single framework, the program dependence graph  (2) performing a thorough analysis and experimental study of the  effects of register assignment strategies on scheduling to  increase fine-grain parallelism. The second direction is to  investigate the interactions between code transformations  improving memory performance and other compiler phases. In  particular, the proposed work will investigate (1) the impact of  scalar replacement and software prefetching on instruction  scheduling to increase fine-grain parallelism and on register  allocation (2) strategies for enabling communication between code  transformations to increase memory performance, register  allocation, and instruction scheduling.  ***",
