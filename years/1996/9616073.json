The U.S.  participants, along with some Indian researchers, will make  presentations at a Workshop on Artificial Intelligence Techniques  Applied in Electric Distribution Systems.  The primary purpose of  the U.S. participation is to share and exchange the latest  research ideas in various aspects such as planning, operation,  and control of distribution systems.  The participants will be  able to obtain useful data on research work in other theme areas  of the conference. Indian researchers have contributed heavily to  the proposed workshop theme area, and the U.S. contingent can  benefit from the visit by identifying fresh approaches to  handling the problems at home in the deregulated environment.   Major public and private sector power companies sponsor the  biennial conference held under the aegis of leading educational  institution such as the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur,  India.  The conference had been a major event in the power system  area, and attended by well over 400 scientist, engineers,  consultants, manufacturers, and utility personnel.  ***",
