 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,  focusses on characterizing semiconductor/liquid interfaces created at silicon  surfaces by covalently attaching moieties directly to silicon without an  intervening oxide bridge.  Professor Nathan S. Lewis and his students of the  Department of Chemistry at the California Institute of Technology will employ  voltammetric, microwave conductivity, and differential capacitance methods to  characterize the electron transfer and photochemical properties of these  interfaces that are not complicated by the presence of an oxide bridge.  This  project aims to understand the fundamentals of how electron transfer can be  controlled at these modified silicon semiconductor/liquid interfaces.  Silicon is the fundamental building block for constructing semiconductor  devices.  Despite its common use for such applications its  electron transfer  properties remain poorly understood.  This research group, led by Professor  Nathan S. Lewis at the California Institute of Technology, is making seminal  contributions to the understanding of the properties of semiconductor/liquid  interfaces such as the dependence of electron transfer rate on distance.  This  project uses unique chemistry to assess such properties of the  semiconductor/liquid interface.  The utility of this project lies in its  potential for many practical applications in solar energy conversion.",
