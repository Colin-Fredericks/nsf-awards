The last time that this congress was held in the US was in 1967.  This grant will provide direct support for the John F. Kennedy Student Paper Competition.  It is the specific aim of this activity to enhance the capability for fluid mechanics research in the broad area of hydraulic and environmental engineering by encouraging our best students to remain in the field.  The support of fluid mechanics in these fields is one of the central themes of the Fluid Dynamics and Hydraulics Program.  A small investment in the best of our students in this field will yield a large payoff in terms of future capability in a field of engineering that will have a great impact in meeting societal needs in the future.  The University of Iowa has agreed to cost share on a dollar for dollar basis.  ***              Roger E.A. Arndt  Program Director, 1443",
