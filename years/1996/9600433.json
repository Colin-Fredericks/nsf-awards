The meeting will focus on a broad range of magnetic resonance methods as applied to studies of biological processes.  This biennial meeting has become the major venue for discussion of advances in NMR studies of the high resolution structure and dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids and of the role of magnetic resonance (both NMR and EPR) in structural biology.  NMR studies of protein structure often rival those by x-ray crystallography, but NMR also provides unique information on the dynamics of macromolecules - an area that will be emphasized in the scientific program.  In vivo NMR spectroscopic and imaging results to be presented will shed light on metabolic processes and on their cellular ramifications.  Other sessions will cover new magnetic resonance methods, advances in magnet design, and improvements in instrumentation for spectroscopy and imaging.  Considerable effort has been made to plan symposia in such a way as to stimulate cross-fertilization of ideas among the communities expert in high resolution NMR, solid state NMR, EPR, in vivo spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging.  The conference is built around 12 plenary lectures and 27 parallel sessions with a total of 81 invited talks and 27 short contributions selected from poster abstracts.  Three poster sessions of up to 200 posters each round out the program.    The funds provided by NSF will provide partial support for travel of 75 younger scientists (graduate students, postdoctorals, beginning faculty).  Funds are also being sought from industry and other government agencies.  By permitting more younger scientists to attend, the grant will be particularly beneficial in promoting the active participation of female and, to some extent, minority investigators, who tend to be disproportionately represented in the younger gro up.  %%%",
