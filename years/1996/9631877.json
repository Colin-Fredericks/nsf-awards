 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jacqueline M. Hughes-Oliver  North Carolina State University    Data collection in the semiconductor industry is such that  repeated measurements --- obtained over a spatial grid on a  single wafer --- are the norm, not the exception.  Following this  proposed planning period, the projected research goal is the  development of methodological advances for nonlinear modeling of  spatially correlated data with nonstationary, nonnormal errors.   This work is well motivated by two real-life applications, which  both indicate immediate need for these advances.    A major result of research on the analysis of repeated  measurements  is the discovery that careful representation  of the correlation structure is not necessary, provided the  number of experimental units far exceeds the number of repeated  measurements.  The cost of wafers in the semiconductor industry,  however, prohibits collection of data for very many wafers.   Hence, careful representation of the possibly nonstationary error  covariance structure must be undertaken.  This constitutes the  first of the planning activities.  Specific modeling and  estimation techniques must also be investigated in light of the  (new) correlation structures.  These constitute additional  planning activities.  Realistic modeling of these semiconductor  processes require relaxing the assumption of normality, and a  willingness to consider nonlinear models.  Planning activities  include preliminary investigations of the complications arising  from these generalities.  The final activity is the development  of the regular NSF proposal.",
