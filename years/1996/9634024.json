Upright stance in humans is regulated by a  complex control system that involves a number of different  sensory mechanisms, including the proprioceptive system.  Aperiodic stochastic resonance (ASR) is a phenomenon wherein the  response of a nonlinear system to a subthreshold aperiodic input  signal is optimized by the presence of a particular level of  noise.  ASR has been demonstrated in a simple neuronal model and  in cutaneous sensory neurons.  This work suggests that it should  be possible to introduce noise artificially into a  neurophysiological sensory system (e.g., the proprioceptive  system) in order to improve its ability to detect arbitrary  subthreshold signals.  To date, however, bioengineering  applications have not been explored.  The specific objectives of  this study are 1) to develop a physiologically-realistic neuronal  model as a test-bed for bioengineering applications of ASR; 2) to  demonstrate that the detection thresholds of the proprioceptive  system are changed with the addition of input noise; and 3) to  demonstrate that noise-induced changes to the proprioceptive  detection thresholds at the ankle affect the postural control  system.  This work could result in the development of an  inexpensive technique for improving the performance of the human  postural control system.  Such a technique could have important  ramifications for individuals with elevated proprioceptive  thresholds, such as older adults and patients with neural  disorders, who may be predisposed to falls.  Thus, the results of  this project could eventually serve to reduce the incidence,  cost, and health risks of falling.  ***",
