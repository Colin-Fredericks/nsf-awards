 "awd_abstract_narration": "9523648  Padture    The objective of the proposed research is to understand the  aspects of microstructural evolution in in situ-reinforced  (ISR) silicon carbide (SiC).  This is a new class of tough  ceramics in which  elongated-grain reinforcements are grown  in situ within the microstructure during pressureless liquid-  phase sintering.  The proposed research consists of two sets  of critical experimental studies:  1) a systematic  study of  densification and grain--growth kinetics in polycrystalline  liquid-phase sintered SiC, and 2) a systematic study of  growth kinetics of isolated SiC grains grown in s  supersaturated Al-Y-O-C glass.  The results of the  experiments will be critically analyzed, with reference to  existing models whenever possible, to determine the rate-  controlling mechanisms for densification, normal grain  growth and anisotropic grain growth.  %%%  It is anticipated that the proposed study will provide a  comprehensive picture of the evolution of the  microstructures in ISR SiC an understanding vital to the  effective tailoring of mechanical properties.  In addition,  the research also has the potential to contribute toward a  broader goal of guiding general processing efforts for  creating the next generation of ISR ceramics with novel  microstructures for superior mechanical properties.  ***",
