 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the more neglected areas in Biology education is Plant Biology. Agricultural research universities have seen an increasing drop in enrollment, especially in the plant sciences. Yet, the reality is that agricultural research, crop management and improvement, land management, and environmental problems are a growing concern in the world. The contribution of plants to society is ubiquitous. For example, plants have always been a critical component of the pharmaceutical industry. More recently, gasohol has quickly come to be viewed as a realistic source of renewable fuel. However, the lack of education in Plant Biology is sadly evident within Biology curricula in many colleges and universities.    The department proposes to elevate the importance of Plant Science education in a Biology curriculum by adding a more hands-on approach to science laboratories using plants as a model system. Plant metabolism studies provide a good laboratory experience for students to observe a process involving organismic, cellular, and molecular aspects. Research projects are being set up that examine the effects of environmental stresses such as heavy metals and salt on plant functions. The effects can be quantified using physiological and biochemical measurements as well as being viewed at the level of gene expression.   A model Plant Biology program, using new equipment, can be used to ask questions about important processes involving plant metabolism. This model for investigative research can specifically influence undergraduate Plant Biology education and investigative science education in general. The instrumentation may also enhance other advanced courses and a Biology core course for nonmajors.",
