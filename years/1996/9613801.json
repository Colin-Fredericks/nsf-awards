 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the National Science Foundation will enable the the   Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities to place seven students   with the Foundation through the HACU National Internship Program (HNIP).    HNIP enhances the awareness of federal sector professional opportunities   among Hispanic college students. The program is comprised of a fully   administered and managed ten-week student internship program. It places   college students in stimulating and challenging professional and   educational roles within the federal sector. Utilizing an intensive   summer model, HACU and the sponsoring departments/agencies provide   academically qualified students with experience-based learning. Student   interns are placed in federal offices and laboratories located in the   Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and in field sites throughout the   United States and Puerto Rico. Student placements are based upon position   descriptions provided by supervisors which detail the academic   preparation, work experience and special skills required to perform the   job.  HACU also provides a parallel set of developmental activities for   students placed in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area geared to   enhance the understanding of and interest in federal career initiatives   and other educational information, cultural diversity issues, community   service, and leadership and networking opportunities.  The internship program is specifically designed to achieve the following   objectives:  To provide professional experience for Hispanic students that will enable   them to make educated career choices;  to expose students to research,   development, technology, and administrative career opportunities in the   federal government;  to supplement academic study with practical   applications for students majoring in relevant fields and related   disciplines;  to extend and strengthen the relationship between   government agencies/bureaus and  HSIs and other institutions that have   significant Hispanic enrollment and that offer  related academic   programs. These ties will continue to offer an expanded recruitment   resource to the federal departments;  to encourage students to explore   and possibly pursue careers relevant to offerings found with the federal   sector;  to present or make available to both Washington D.C. and field   site interns  information that reinforces the departmental outreach efforts that   assist, train, and prepare Hispanic students for potential federal career   opportunities and service.",
