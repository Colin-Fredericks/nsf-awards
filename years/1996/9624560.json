 "awd_abstract_narration": "NOTE: This CAREER award is a companion project to the CAREER  award CCR-96-24439, ``Cryptography, Proof Checking and  Approximation'', University of California, San Diego.  This  project focuses on the new area of provable security.  Provable security is achieved for a problem, when one  provides (i) a definition of security for the problem, (ii)  a protocol, and (iii) a proof that the protocol meets its  definition, assuming, for example, the intractability of  factoring.   Instead of just producing triples (definition,  protocol, proof), the goal of the project is to utilize  reductions as a technique for making precise statements  about the security of concrete cryptographic schemes; for  example, ``if you can break authentication protocol P with  resources X, then you can break the Data Encryption Standard  with resources Y''.  In particular, applications of these  techniques have already lead to a treatment of asymmetric  encryption, message authentication, entity authentication,  and key distribution. Protocols designed employing practice  oriented provable security have resulted in protocols used  in products of IBM and Microsoft, and in a proposed  International Standard.  The Integrated Educational Plan of  this CAREER Grant includes developing (a) a new graduate  course in modern cryptography; (b) undergraduate security  projects which are difficult, open-ended, and design  oriented; (c) course and course materials for a new  undergraduate course in graphs, games and coloring.***",
