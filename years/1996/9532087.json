The  conference is jointly sponsored/organized by the IEEE Industrial  Applications Society, the IEEE Power Electronics Society, IEEE  Power Engineering, and IEEE Indian Sections.  The organizers are  seeking active international participation to provide a forum for  academia, engineers, and researchers in industry to discuss the  latest developments in power electronics, drives, energy systems  and related areas.  The primary purpose if the U.S. participation  is to disseminate and transfer the latest research ideas on  various topics of relevance to the conference theme.    India represents one of the most dynamic economics in the world  today, with an enormous potential for consuming, manufacturing,  and supplying high-quality engineering products.  The conference  is to provide a forum for academia, researchers, and engineers to  discuss the challenges, problems, and directions of the future  technological growth of India and other developing nations.   Today many U.S. companies are seeking an active presence in India  through partnerships with Indian firms, in order to access a  share of this emerging market, and to be able to utilize the  lower-cost technical work force.  Another of the goals of PEDES  1996 is to provide a mechanism for fostering contacts that will  enable the formation of such partnerships.  Through the  exhibition at the conference, U.S. companies will be able to  display their capabilities, and further their long-term business  interests in India.  ***",
