Because the vocal control regions regulate  a single behavior, studies on this subject offer a unique  opportunity for elucidating the neural bases of behavior.  Steroidal hormones play essential roles in this system s  sexual differentiation and in vocal behavior learning and  expression.  However, extensive research on steroid effects  has not satisfactorily explained characteristics of the  vocal control system at all stages of song development and  expression.  The investigators have observed opioids and  their receptors in vocal control regions.  In other systems  opioids modulate neuron morphology and survival, sensory  processing, and learning and memory.  In order to ascertain  whether opioids regulate any of these features of vocal  control, it is necessary to determine if any correlation  exists between vocal control system opioid activity an d  particular aspects of singing behavior.  The proposed work  will use radioimmunoassays to measure opioid concentrations  in vocal control regions microdissected from dark-eyed junco  (Junco hyemalis) brains during four stages: song template  storage, song expression, song recognition, and post-  breeding cessation of singing behavior.  Additionally, a  parallel study that will directly asses the effects of  chronic opioid antagonist administration on singing behavior  in adult male juncos will be conducted.  This project will  help direct future research on the role(s) of opioids in  controlling behavior.",
