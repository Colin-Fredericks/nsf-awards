Research during the last fifteen years that has  determined some conditions under which knowledge acquired in  school endures for long periods of time has proved useful to  educators and curriculum designers.  However, that research has  concentrated on memory for discrete items such as foreign  language vocabulary, and relatively little attention has been  given to verbatim retention of complex material.  There has been  some work examining long-term recall of passages learned  verbatim; this research has found that such passages were  generally acquired by chaining and, due to the shallow processing  involved, when one link in the chain was broken, the rest of the  material became unavailable.  However, research into professional  acting expertise has shown that actors' retention of material is  based on extremely deep processing which probes the text at a  micro level to extract information about character and  motivation.   Also, actors necessarily \"overlearn\" material; this  overlearning has been found to be one of the important predictors  of long-term storage found in earlier research.  Therefore, when  material is learned in this manner, it should still be available  months after it has ceased being rehearsed or performed.  In  addition to looking at long-term retention itself, this project  will investigate the effects of movement on such retention.  A  rich body of evidence has shown enhanced recall of words and  phrases through enactment, and it has frequently been suggested  that this facilitation is due to the existence of motoric codes.    However, that research has almost invariably been confined to  short words or phrases rather than connected discourse, and the  movements involved were usually literal enactments of the verbal  material.  In contrast, this research will examine the influence  of movement on the retenti on of lengthy, complex, verbal material  when the movement is not a literal enactment of that material.   The prediction is that, many months after the final performance  of a role, actors (who will have learned new roles in the  interim) will retain a large majority of their lines verbatim and  will be able to demonstrate enhanced recall when reenacting the  movement patterns.  Furthermore, the prediction is that the  remembered text will be in exact order, a type of recall that is  crucial to many technologically-oriented tasks, such as  remembering the various steps essential for proper software  operation.    ***",
