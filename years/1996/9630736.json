This  is  accomplished by introducing liquid Helium-4 and Helium-3/Helium-4  mixtures  into  porous media, such as silica  aerogel  or  porous  gold,  two  substrates made by the investigator. In  this  random  environment  of  the porous media, the superfluid  transition  of  confined  pure Helium-4 was found to be completely  altered  from  the  bulk liquid although the transition remains remarkably sharp  and  exhibits well defined simple power law behavior.  The  power  law  exponents are significantly modified even though the  silica  based aerogel constitutes only a few percent of the total volume.  When  Helium-3/Helium-4 mixtures are added  to  the  aerogel  the  phase  diagram of Helium-3/Helium-4 mixture is completely altered  giving  rise to a new Helium-3 rich superfluid phase in  addition  to  the  usual  Helium-3 rich superfluid. The phase  diagram  and  behavior  of mixtures when the volume fraction of the aerogel  is  further reduced will be studied.  %%%  In  the last two decades, a great deal has been learned about how  one  phase  of pure matter transforms into another, e.g.,  liquid  into  gas  and  superconductor into normal metal.   In  the  real  world,  disorder and impurities are very often present  in  these  systems. This project will provide an understanding of the effect  of such impurities on the nature of a specific system, namely the  transformation  of  liquid Helium-4 from the  superfluid  to  the  normal  state.  This system can be carefully controlled  so  that  conclusions   can   be   applied  to  technologically   important  materials. Impurities are introduced by adding liquid helium into  porous aerogel or porous gold of well characterized porosity  and  topology. Experiments to date  reveal unexpected results including  an   extraordinary  sharp  transition  inspite  of   the   random  environment and the creation of a new 3He rich superfluid  phase.  Study  is  planned of this unusual behavior and the variation  of  these properties with temperature, pressure and concentration  of  the two helium isotopes.  ***",
