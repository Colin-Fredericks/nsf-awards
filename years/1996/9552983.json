 "awd_abstract_narration": "9552983  Serrell    Under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research Guidelines, Serrell  and Associates will do \"A Meta-Analysis of Visitor Time/Use in  Museum Exhibitions.\"  The research will examine the long considered  and debated questions revolving around visitors expenditure of  their time (duration and allocation) in science museums exhibits.   Serrell will undertake the largest, systematic study of its kind.   Using a large number of systemically made observations of visitors  time/use, baseline data will be developed that will answer some of  the fundamental questions about visitor's movements in an exhibit.   This work builds on and expands, considerably, the current data  base of observations from 48 exhibits to over 100 exhibitions.   This is not a new research topic but it is one that deserves more  attention because it has not been studied systematically.   Researchers generally assume a positive correlation between time  spent on task and learning but beyond that there are a number of  provocative questions and unverified theories.  Many questions lack  sufficient data to draw conclusions.  This study will provide  statistical correlations between variables observed and will be  absed on large, methodologically similar database, which does not  currently exist.",
