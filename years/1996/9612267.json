The PIs propose to carry out spectroscopic  analyses of impurities and defects in optical glasses to  determine the nature of rare-earth environments.  These  analyses include optically detected magnetic resonance, nuclear  magnetic resonance , x-ray absorption fine structure, electron  spin resonance, and Raman spectroscopy.  An understanding of  the properties of these defects is critical to the production  of glasses that exhibit higher gain and photo-induced index  changes per induced absorption.  These glasses, in turn, will  make possible the development of new types of devices for  optical telecommunications.  %%%  The proposed research is a multidisciplinary effort involving  University of Rochester and Stanford University, along with  industrial collaborators from Eastman Kodak and Corning, to  study the environments of rare-earth dopants and defects in  optical glasses.
