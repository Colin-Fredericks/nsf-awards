 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521336  Steckler       In the Cenozoic many margins underwent major changes in  morphology and evolved from carbonate ramp to prograding clastic  shelves, while the world climate changed permanently from a  hothouse to icehouse conditions.  On NJ margin the switch from  carbonate ramp to siliciclastic shelf occurred in the early  Oligocene.  On the Angola margin the Eocene-Oligocene boundary  time evidenced a major erosional event.  My Miocene both margins  were dominated by siliciclastic progradation and margins evolved  to the modern continental margins with flat shelves and shelf-  slope breaks.  This pattern is also observed at other margins and  require an increase in sediment supply from Oligocene to Miocene.  By mid-Oligocene the carbonate factory had shut down over the  previously dominant carbonate ramps.  The siliciclastic shift  occurs at the same time as the development of the icehouse  conditions, a long-term lowering of sea level and increase in  terrigenous sediment supply due to enhanced continental  seasonality and erosion.  The study will reconstruct the African  margin to understand the shift in continental margin morphology  and stratigraphy from seismic data.  Backstripping or forward  modeling of the margin will be performed to determine the  approximate tectonic subsidence.  ***",
