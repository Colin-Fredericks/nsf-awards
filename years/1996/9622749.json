 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622749  Trosset   Numerical algorithms for multidimensional scaling (MDS) construct  geometric configurations from dissimilarity data by attempting to  solve specific optimization problems.  It has long been widely  believed that most MDS problems are plagued by the existence of  local solutions that are not global solutions, and considerable  effort has been expended addressing this difficulty.  Recently,  various researchers have proposed searching for global solutions  by such \"off-the-shelf\" global optimization methods as simulated  annealing, tunneling, and continuation.  These methods are quite  computationally expensive and research by the principal  investigator suggests that they may be largely unnecessary.  This  research involves properly reformulating the structure of many  important MDS problems such that local searches, which invariably  find global solutions, can be exploited.  This research concerns computational methods for multidimensional  scaling, a collection of statistical techniques for  mathematically constructing geometric configurations of objects  from information about the distances between those objects.  For  example, a chemist might want to \"construct\" a molecule with  certain interatomic distances, or a psychologist might want to  geometrically represent a set of stimuli using data about the  differences that human subjects perceived between pairs of  stimuli.  Such problems pose formidable computational challenges.   The focus of this research is on developing more efficient  methods for computing optimal solutions of these problems.",
