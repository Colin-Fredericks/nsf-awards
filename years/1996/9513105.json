The co-organizers are  Dr. Robert Stern of the University of Texas at Dallas and  Professor Makoto Arima of the Yokohama National University.  The main purpose of this meeting is to discuss the state of  present understanding of the 3000 km long Izu-Bonin-Mariana  convergent margin (IBM arc system), and to develop plans for  future cooperative research programs in this arc system.  A  total of 12 Japanese, 12 U.S., and 3 foreign scientists will  participate.  Five aspects of the IBM arc will be the focus  of the workshop and field trip:  1) Generation of arc and  back-arc basin magmas; 2) Early arc history and forearc  evolution; 3) Back-arc basin evolution; and 4) Hydrothermal  processes and ore deposits; and 5) Crustal and lithospheric  structure.    The U.S. participants provide a broad cross section of  expertise and geographical representation in the area of  Western Pacific convergent margin  processes, and were  selected on the basis of being the most active researchers  in the U.S.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills the  objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of  scientific knowledge through an international collaboration.  ***",
