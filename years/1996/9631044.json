 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bond  9631044    Insects often avoid predation through their resemblance to  the backgrounds on which they rest. For example, the  cryptically patterned forewings of woodland moths blend into  the tree bark, making them difficult to detect. Many of  these insects are polymorphic, which means that they occur  in a variety of distinctive forms. Predatory birds, such as  blue jays, that feed on these cryptic insects use a  technique called hunting by searching image, in which they  concentrate their foraging efforts on one prey type at a  time while effectively ignoring the other types. This  behavior improves their ability to detect cryptically  patterned prey. It has often been assumed that polymorphism  in prey species is an adaptive response to predators using  searching images. This relationship between the behavior of  the predator and the population biology of the prey has  never been rigorously investigated. Using the responses of  blue jays to computer-generated images of moths on a  cryptic, textured background, the proposed research will  explore several important features of the searching image  mechanism and examine the effects of the predator's behavior  on the diversity and abundance of prey.",
