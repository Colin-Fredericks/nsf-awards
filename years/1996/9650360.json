 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project details a method for transporting the student-team research approach to biology education that has been implemented in the Enhanced Bioscience Education (EBE) program to content-sensitive upper-division courses in animal physiology. This approach is designed to maintain content breadth in the lecture component of the course and emphasize in-depth, student-initiated and -conducted research in the laboratory component of the course. In this way, the project maintains and extends the research skills and enthusiasm engendered by investigational programs such as EBE while protecting the breadth of coverage required in certain upper-division courses (particularly those with a preclinical audience).   The department is remodeling the current laboratories in physiology by purchasing equipment to allow research by students in one of five concentration areas (modules). These modules allow the department to focus the research, obtain sufficient equipment for those modules, and facilitate research with pretested and approved protocols.   By using computers for background research, data acquisition, data analysis, and modeling physiological systems, participants build on the strengths of EBE. Furthermore, the project is extending the research skills of the students both by providing equipment capable of research activities as close as possible to current professional levels, and by creating a Physiology DataBank for research results, allowing replication and extension of prior work in the courses. Finally, the project involves a presentation of results that is integral to the student's research.",
