Ohio State University  Title: A Cooperative Ice Core Paleoclimate Study of Monsoon                Variability as Archived in the Dasuopu Glacier, China    This award supports the retrieval and analysis of ice cores from  the tropical Dasuopu glacier located in the south central Himalayas  where conventional, long-term climatic data are completely absent.   Tropical records are of particular interest as 50% of the global  surface lies between 30oN and 30oS and 75% of the Earth's population  inhabits these climatically tropical lands.  The records from these  cores will complement the long histories recovered from Dunde and  Guliya ice caps, on the northeastern and northwestern margins of  the Qinghai-Tibetan (Q-T) Plateau.  Located on the southern margin  of the Q-T Plateau the new drilling site lies well within the  spatial extent of the monsoon system.  Dominance of monsoonal  circulation produces distinctly annual cycles in oxygen isotopic  ratios and in the deposition of visible dust which permit the  reconstruction of high resolution (annual) records of climatic and  environmental conditions.  Dasuopu is located just north of the  Himalayas with annual precipitation about 300 mm water equivalent  (H2O eq.).  The high elevation of this site ensures that ice  temperatures will be well below OoC, hence this glacier may be  \"polar: in character and is likely to contain a long, well-  preserved record.  The initial field program includes a complement  of geophysical and surface studies designed to determine the  suitability of this glacier for the recovery of high resolution,  well-preserved ice core records.  Studies of the climate of China  are plagued by the absence of data from major sections of the (Q-T)  Plateau and the surrounding high mountain ranges.  The successful  retrieval of previous records (Dunde and Guliya) suggest that ice  cores from carefully selected ice caps in Asia are excellent  archives for climatic and environmental histories.   These records  are essential to fill one of the major spatial gaps in the Earth's  climate history.",
