These studies of colloids center around new ideas for the control  of colloidal particle motion.  In particular, traps and templates  for   particles  on  substrates  will  be  created  by  carefully  constructing free energy barriers. These free energy barriers are  brought  about as a result of entropy effects in the  suspension.  Photon  transport investigations will center on  the  fundamental  properties of highly scattered light. In particular the  research  will   study  how  material  anisotropy,  and  fluctuations   are  impressed upon photon electromagnetic fields that diffuse through  turbid media in a manner similar to heat flow.  %%%  Careful  study  of light beams passing into highly scattering  or  turbid  materials has revealed a variety of interesting phenomena  and  applications. Light diffuses through these substances  in  a  manner  similar  to  heat  flow. As a  result  of  our  increased  knowledge about these processes diffusing light can now  be  used  to  generate  low resolution images of absorption  or  scattering  variations  within  human tissues and in  other  complex,  opaque  media.  One  goal  of  this proposal is to  develop  an  improved  fundamental  understanding  of these processes,  and  to  further  develop  the instrumentation required to exploit these phenomena,  so  that more diverse applications are possible. A secondary goal  of  this  proposal is to create new materials based  on  particle  suspension that may be of use in the topical field of photonics.  ***",
