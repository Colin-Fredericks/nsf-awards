A  bay-wide data set will  be  collected  on  the  distribution of gelatinous predators (medusae and ctenophores),  as  they  are related to large-scale hydrographic features in the water  column.  The  features  of particular focus will  be  the  seasonal  pycnocline,  fronts,  the hydraulic control point,  and  biological  patches.   Regions   of   the  bay  for  intensive   mapping,   and  process-oriented  studies include the polyhaline southern  bay  and  the  mesohaline mid-bay. In process-oriented studies,  feeding  and  fecundity  will  be  measured to determine if trophic  interactions  increase  at hydrographic features. TIES will continuously  measure  mesozooplankton abundances and temperature, salinity,  chlorophyll,  and   dissolved   oxygen.  Depth-discrete  samples  of   gelatinous  predators  will  be  made  using an  opening  closing  net  system.  Biovolumes,  numbers,  and sizes of the live  gelatinous  organisms  will  be  determined  on board ship. Small and  delicate  specimens  (larval  ctenophores  and  hydromedusae) will  be  quantified  from  additional  vertical plankton hauls. Individual specimens  will  be  collected  and (1) preserved immediately for gut content  analysis,  and  (2) incubated overnight for egg production. Data analysis will  emphasize  3-dimensional mapping and correlations  of  hydrographic  data  with  population data on regional, seasonal, and  interannual  bases, as well as comparisons of the trophic and reproductive  data  relative   to  hydrographic  features.  Gelatinous  predators   are  important  components of the pelagic food web  in  Chesapeake  Bay.  Aggregations  of jellyfish occur because of interactions  of  their  behaviors  with the physical  characteristics of the  water  column.  Chesapeake   Bay   is  physically  complex,  with   many   possible  aggregating  features.  Population  data  exist  for   only   three  gelatinous  species in the bay, but 30 species have been  reported.  This  research  will provide critical studies on  how  physics  and  biology  interact to cause intensification of trophic  interactions  at fronts and other physical features.       ***",
