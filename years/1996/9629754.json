 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses problems in the areas of object-  oriented programming languages and software security. The  goals are to simplify the structure and process of producing  software systems and increase their resistance to certain  forms of insecurity. The techniques are both analytical,  drawing on ideas from type theory and mathematical logic,  and experimental, involving the implementation of language  designs and experimental development of prototype systems.  One main focus of the work is the design and implementation  of an extension of Standard ML with object-oriented  features. Similar language ideas are also considered for C++  or Java variants or design or debugging tools. An  experimental evaluation of either language may involve  design or redesign of existing software in order to improve  its security properties. This might involve network servers  such as ftp or http, or an interpreter for a network  scripting language. Both the science of software production  and  software security are considered important areas, with  increasing concern for security likely to lead to increasing  interest in relevant software analysis methods.  ***",
