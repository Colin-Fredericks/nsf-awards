The workshop will be held in Szeged, Hungary, during August 25-27, 1997, and is intended to bring together Hungarians researchers with strong fundamental mathematical expertise and U.S. counterparts who excel in more applied research.  Five participants from other counties are also invited to attend, at their own expense.    The objective of this workshop is to pursue problems of discrete tomography, where the domain may be discrete, or continuous, and there exists an unknown function f whose range is known to be a given discrete set.  Discussions will feature problems where we know the discrete range of f, thus allowing us to determine its value at points where without this knowledge it could not be determined.  Such questions are relevant to solutions that may be applicable to electron microscopy and nondestructive testing.    This workshop on number theory pertaining to discrete tomography fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.     ??",
