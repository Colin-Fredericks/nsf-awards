 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622516  Wang  In recent years, various monitoring and diagnosis hardware  have been developed for applications to civil  infrastructures.  It is now possible to design an automated  and reliable system, which can both continuously monitor the  structural performance of a bridge and assess its status of  damage or deterioration.    This project conducts a three year research effort to  develop an automated monitoring system implements on a long  suspension bridge in China, which will make available to the  project personal assistance such as technicians and logic  supports required for the field experiments.  The effort  will be focused on the design and development of a self  displacement measurement device and a wireless data  communication system.  The diagnosis techniques include  finite element modeling of the suspension bridge, modeling  and measurement of strong wind,earthquakes and traffic  loading, analysis of the ambient vibration data through the  use of NExT technique to eliminate the use of an exciter, a  global damage diagnosis technique to identify the damage,  and selection of sensors and techniques to detect localized  damage and defects.  A section model of the suspension  bridge will also be constructed and tested in the wind  tunnel at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in  order to determine some of the aerodynamic parameters and to  calibrate and optimize the sensor locations.    This investigation involves international team of  researchers including industries, universities and national  laboratories.  The ultimate goal of the research is to  design and develop an advanced system that can be  practically and efficiently installed into a long span  bridge to monitor day to day activities and to detect the  damage or give a warning when a critical stress has been  reached.  Although a suspension bridge will be selected on  line condition monitoring in this project, the developed  system is expected to be also applicable in other large  structure systems includin g truss bridges and tall buildings  under severe loading conditions such as earthquakes and  strong winds.  ***",
