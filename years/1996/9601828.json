 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recently established MIT Center for Biological and Computational Learning (CBCL) unites seven faculty in the study of computational neuroscience with specialization in the areas of visual perception, motor control, language and the theory of learning. Recently space has been made available and renovated to bring the group together in a single physical location and this NSF award provides an infrastructure for research and training activities with the purchase of a modern networked computer laboratory, including workstations, servers and a network hub. Items to be purchased include 3 Bay Networks Network Huns, three Sun UltraServers, an SGI Indigo High-Impact Workstation and an Electrohome Marquee 8500 projector. Central to the facility  is a 'virtual reality` system in which complex multi-modal stimuli (visual, auditory and haptic), can be synthesized and presented to subjects. A system for recording the positions of subjects' limbs and eyes will be developed, with tight coupling to the stimulus display system. The Electrohome Marquee projector is a high-brightness projector which displays stimuli in a large field of view. The visual stimuli will be generated on the high-performance Silicon Graphics Indigo which, when equipped with a High Impact video board, can generate real time texture-mapped images.  The problem of understanding intelligence in terms of its algorithmic realization in the mind and brain is one of the greatest challenges of modern science. It has many facets; one which has become a unifying goal throughout the computational and brain sciences is the problem of understanding how an animal or a machine can learn. CBCL has provided leadership in research on learning mechanisms by developing a theoretical understanding of learning and by applying this understanding to a wide variety of problems in the domains of visual perception, motor control and language. The instrumentation provided through this grant will significantly further that goal.",
