 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ronald Lovett is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to develop a strategy for calculating   Third Law free energies of solids.  A simulation approach that converts a   solid continuously into an ideal gas provides the formalism for defining   the free energy of a metastable and transitory structure.  Analytical and   computer simulations-based estimates for the free energies of solid   structures using this definition will be used to predict the equilibrium   structure of a solid, determine the accessibility of equilibrium   structures, and calculate the rates of fundamental steps in the growth of   solid structures.  These techniques will also be used to estimate the   surface free energy of solid-solid and solid-fluid interfaces.  Properties of commercially important solid state materials depend on   their structure.  It is frequently the case that multiple solid state   structures are possible, and to know which physical structures can be   realized, one must be able to assign a free energy to all candidate   structures.  Furthermore, to know whether a particular structure can be   realized by transformation from a liquid or another solid structure, one   must also be able to assign free energies to intermediate, transitory   structures.  Lovett's research is directed at finding an analytical   approach to determining the free energies solids as well as the barriers   that separate various solid state structures from each other.",
