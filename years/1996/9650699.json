 "awd_abstract_narration": "Undergraduates often view the engineering curriculum as a disjointed array of courses connected only by the prefix in front of the course number. When the students view the laboratory experiments_experiences which should reinforce and extend the principles forwarded in theory courses_as a potpourri, the problem becomes more exacerbated. This project is attempting to combat this problem by developing laboratory experiences that build upon one other. Mechanical dissection has worked in teaching introductory engineering students. A twist to this proven method, \"process dissection\" is forwarded to breakdown a chemical process into its series of physicochemical phenomena. As in any dissection, diagnostics are important. In the case of chemical engineering, this requires well-instrumented, controlled experiments and analytical instrumentation. The subsequent reintegration of the process should help students better appreciate the laboratory experience. The instructional development is using interactive group activities as a way to integrate student learning.",
