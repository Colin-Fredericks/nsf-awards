 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625795  Majda       The investigator continues research on the theory and  applications of partial differential equations to problems in  turbulence and atmosphere/ocean science.  He uses a combination  of physical modelling, asymptotic methods, stochastic techniques,  rigorous mathematical theory, and large scale computing to yield  new insight into physical phenomena.  This project studies  specific topics in two areas: 1) turbulent reaction diffusion  equations, and 2) averaging over fast, random, and statistical  waves in geophysical flows.  The work in area 1 involves the  development of new stochastic, asymptotic, and computational  methods for studying scaling behavior in turbulent diffision and  turbulent reaction diffusion equations where the velocity fields  have many spatio-temporal scales.  Potential applications to  atmosphere/ocean science are described here, including tracer  scale up in the mesoscale and turbulent mixing in marine cloud  topped boundary layers.  The work in area 2 involves four  distinct topics regarding geophysical flows:  A) averaging over  fast gravity waves and the obstructions to balanced dynamics; B)  statistical theories for large scale coherent structure and the  Antarctic circumpolar current; C) baroclinic instability and  geostrophic turbulence; D) parameterization of strong mesoscale  convection events in the tropics.  The research in topics C) and  D) involves specific collaborations with atmosphere/ocean  scientists at GFDL in Princeton and at NCAR in Boulder.       Behaviors of the atmosphere and ocean are complex and not  well understood.  This project aims at a better understanding of  atmosphere and ocean flows.  Such an understanding could lead to  improved predictions of weather, climate, and environmental  phenomena.",
