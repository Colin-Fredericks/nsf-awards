The primary objective of this meeting is to bring together researchers who study transcription in many different biologic contexts.  Because of the diversity of biologic events controlled by transcription, the meeting offers the opportunity for researchers in many different areas to come together to focus on the unique contributions of transcription to their individual studies.  The meeting will begin with sessions designed to explore the structure and function of the basal transcription apparatus and the contributions of chromatin to the control of transcription.  Later sessions will emphasize the contribution of transcription in recombination and repair, the action of hormones, and signal transduction.  Other sessions will emphasize the role of transcription in regulating the cell cycle, transcriptional mechanisms used by oncogenes and viruses, and finally the contribution of transcriptional control mechanisms to the determination of cell type.  ***",
