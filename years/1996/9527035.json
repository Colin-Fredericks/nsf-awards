 "awd_abstract_narration": "9527035  Crow    The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) is  operated by a consortium composed of the University of  Florida, Florida State University, and Los Alamos  National Laboratory. The Laboratory is administered by  Florida State University as a national user facility,  available competitively to users on the basis of merit.  Established in 1990 and dedicated in 1994, the Laboratory  through an extraordinary state-federal partnership with  multi-agency participation has developed unique  facilities in support of magnet-related research at the  highest attainable magnetic fields.  The Laboratory is  structured around three major thrusts:  (1) user  facilities developed in response to users' needs that are  opening new frontiers for science opportunities, (2)  magnet science and technology developed in partnership  with the private sector to enhance U.S. competitiveness,  and (3) basic science research driven by a partnership  between external and in house users that drives high  magnetic field science and technology opportunities at  and beyond the cutting edge.  &&&  During the first five years, the NHMFL established the  essential infrastructure and demonstrated its  international leadership in magnet-related technologies  and science.  The second five years will focus on the  capitalization of the federal and state investment to  realize the full scientific potential of the new facility.  The Laboratory will have a science and magnet technology  program that will expand the current capabilities, develop  new magnet systems, and drive new science discoveries at  the highest fields and at the extremes of pressure and  temperature.  The Laboratory will provide continuous  fields (up to 50 tesla) in the magnetic field region  formerly thought to be reserved for only pulsed magnets  and pulsed fields (100 tesla for milliseconds) in the  range that has been a dream of researchers for over a  decade.  The availability of opportunities in magnetic  resonance at 900 MHz and beyond w ill be a critical aspect  of the Laboratory's efforts to build a users' center of  excellence in very high field magnetic resonance  spectroscopies.  The in-house science program will be  developed in cooperation with the external users and will  address the following research areas:  highly correlated  electron systems including heavy fermions, cuprate  superconductors, molecular conductors, and quantum  systems; magnetic materials; and magnetic resonance  spectroscopies as applied to the chemical, physical, and  biological sciences.  The laboratory is poised to become  the preeminent center for multi-disciplinary research  using high magnetic fields.    ***",
