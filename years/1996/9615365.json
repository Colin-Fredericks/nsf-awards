 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Olivier de Montmollin, Mr. Charles Knight will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct archaeological research at the Olmec site of Palo de Rabo,  located in the Gulf Coast region of Mexico to determine how obsidian was distributed and controlled. Obsidian (volcanic glass), because it holds a razor sharp edge, was a highly prized commodity among peoples such as the Olmec who lacked metal tools since it was used for both cutting and scraping functions. As an important economic commodity, obsidian can be traced through a prehistoric social system and by understanding how it was distributed and controlled, one can gain insight into many aspects of social organization. Obsidian in Middle America is particularly interesting from this perspective because it occurs in only a very limited number of places and through trace element analysis it is possible to trace obsidian from a site back to its source. Thus one can reconstruct not only intrasite but also external trade networks. Palo de Rabo contains widespread surface scatters of obsidian and other cultural material. It also has mounds and plazas associated with elite parts of the site. Mr. Knight will first conduct a general ground reconnaissance to determine the limits of the site and to produce a schematic map. A full coverage survey will then be undertaken with shovel probes where vegetation obscures the surface. On this basis, areas for excavation, including both `elite` and `commoner` residences, will be conducted to collect obsidian and other cultural materials. The obsidian will then be analyzed to determine how and where it was manufactured, distributed and used.  The Olmecs developed the first complex society in Middle America and therefore are of great archaeological interest. They are important subjects for study both for the light they shed on the prehistory of the region and for the insight they can provide into the processes which led to the development of social complexity. Researchers wish to understand how social stratification, which accompanies social complexity takes place and have developed several hypotheses. Two of the most promising concern control over the acquisition and distribution of scares resources and Mr. Knight wishes to uses the Palo de Rabo data to test them. Since obsidian in not locally available in the region, it is a scarce and valuable resource which is ideal for an investigation of this type.  The data Mr. Knight collects will be of interest to many archaeologists. The research will shed light on an important and poorly understood period of Middle American prehistory and will assist in the training of a promising young scientist.",
