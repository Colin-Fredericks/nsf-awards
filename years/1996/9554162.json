Collaborators include six USIs (Chicago, Columbus, New Orleans, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix), one RSI (American Indian Science and Engineering Society), three school districts (in California, Massachusetts, Kentucky), and Fermi Lab (Illinois).  They are responsible for all local support for the courses.  The project uses innovative delivery techniques and new technologies to support asynchronous instruction.  The first eighteen months emphasize examining and improving the effectiveness of the course delivery, monitoring and structure.  The last half of the project expands the scope to include more disciplines as well as a broader range of teachers.  Using a combination of on-line instruction, real and \"virtual\" study groups, video, and other techniques, participants receive the equivalent of 125 contact hours.  The emphasis is on getting teachers involved in extended investigations and supporting these with just-in-time assistance in the requisite skills and knowledge in core disciplines and educational strategies.  Continuing Education Units are available and university graduate credit is anticipated.  An impressive list of instructors ensures expertise in mathematics and all school science disciplines.  Although beginning with just 75 participants, 925 are anticipated.  Cost-sharing and other in-kind contributions will make the project self-sustaining at less that $900 per teacher for approximately 8 credits.  Cost sharing is 9%.          1   1",
