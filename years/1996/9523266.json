Research  will be conducted on a variety of problems in statistical  mechanics with the overall  objective of contributing to the  understanding of macroscopic matter from a microscopic  basis.  Problems to be considered include: properties of  macroscopic systems carrying steady state currents; kinetics  of phase segregation in alloys and fluids including elastic  and hydrodynamical effects, respectively;  equilibrium  statistical mechanics of low temperature phases in quantum  systems; structure of energy levels in typical integrable  and chaotic systems; spatial structure of diffusion  dominated reacting systems; phase diagrams of classical  multicomponent models with vacancies and elastic effects;  and, fundamental problems in the quantum description of the  time evolution of macroscopic systems.  %%%  This grant is supported by the Materials Theory Program in  the Division of Materials Research, the Mathematical Physics  Activity in the Physics Division and the Applied Mathematics  Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences.  Research  will be done on a number of problems in statistical  mechanics which will lead to a better understanding of the  relationship between the large-scale behavior of matter,  e.g., fluids, and its underlying particulate nature, e.g.,  molecules.  This research is fundamental, although its  outcomes should contribute to a better understanding of many  problems of practical interest.  ***",
