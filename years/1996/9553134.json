 "awd_abstract_narration": "9553134  Rockmore       The investigator uses this Presidential Faculty Fellowship to  pursue an interdisciplinary course of research and educational  innovation, unified by the themes of group theory and computation.  The primary research activity centers upon the continued  theoretical and practical development of generalized fast Fourier  transforms (FFTs).  Among the generalizations pursued are the  efficient computation of Fourier transforms on finite and compact  Lie groups and efficient polynomial transforms.  Current approaches  to these sorts of problems draw on the areas of group  representation theory, the theory of operator algebras and  sampling theory.  Practical considerations and goals demand that  implementational aspects such as numerical stability and  computational overhead be addressed as well, and in so doing  require the tools and techniques of numerical analysis, as well as  some knowledge of the targeted applications areas.  This sort of  interdisciplinary paradigm also informs the educational approach.  Under development are several interdisciplinary courses, intended  to increase mathematics interest and awareness among  undergraduates by highlighting the connections of mathematics to  other disciplines.       Arguably, the ``classical'' FFT is one of the most important  computational techniques ever developed.  It is the fundamental  tool behind most of digital signal processing and as such impacts  society in all aspects, playing a key role in areas such as  medical imaging, defense, telecommunications, high performance  computing, and entertainment.  The utility of the classical FFT  indicates that perhaps similar success may be obtained from  applying these newly developed generalized FFTs, and a large part  of this proposal is directed towards this end.  To date,  applications of these new computational methods have been  identified in areas such as climate modeling, image processing,  medical imaging, astronomy and statistics.  These are being pursued  actively.   The connection that this work evinces between pure  research and ``real-world'' application is tremendously useful as  an educational model.  By focusing on this type of theme, the  investigator works towards enhancing the current mathematics  curriculum with the goal of increasing mathematics enrollments and  awareness and in so doing working towards rebuilding the national  scientific infrastructure.",
