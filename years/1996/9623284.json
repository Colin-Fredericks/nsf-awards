The first area is the relationship between Dehn functions of  groups and semigroups and the computational complexity of the  associated word problem. The next goal is to study further the  properties of diagram groups associated with semigroup  presentations.  The third area is that of rewriting systems for  various classes of groups and semigroups.  The fourth area is  extension problems for automata.  The final area is the study of  various algorithmic problems in the theory of group varieties.   This is research in the field of group and semigroup theory.  These areas can be thought of as the study of symmetry in the  abstract.  As such, this area has direct applications to many  areas of physics and chemistry.  Moreover, within the last 30  years, many connections to problems in data transmission have  been solved using techniques from group theory.  There are also  direct connections to the error correcting codes that are vital  for modern computing such as working with CD-ROM's as well as to  theoretical computer science in general.",
