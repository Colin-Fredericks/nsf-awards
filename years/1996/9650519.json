 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide a state-of-the-art Internet access laboratory to advance the teaching methods currently used in the Meteorology and Geology Laboratory courses. Both meteorology and geology represent two of the core offerings of the general science curriculum and thus serve a large and diverse student population. To date, the laboratory sections of these courses have incorporated antiquated lecture/lab manual methodologies of instruction featuring little investigative content. This project seeks to restructure these classes completely into a vibrant, hands-on learning environment through the use of internet image and data products, geographical information system software, and simulation products. This project allows for the construction of a World Wide Web homepage that contains selected data and training modules designed specifically for the meteorology and geology laboratory. Following 1 year of construction, student operation, and student evaluation, the homepage can be made public to the entire environmental studies community.    To be effective, the science laboratory curriculum must reflect the latest innovations and instructional technology. This project prepares science majors with effective computational analysis skills that they can use in their own specific area of interest. For nonmajors, exposure to this technology may encourage them to pursue higher-level science and mathematics courses. This laboratory is of particular importance for future primary and secondary educators, as these courses may represent their only exposure to meteorological and geological technology.",
