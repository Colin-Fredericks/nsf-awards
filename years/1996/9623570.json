 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    9623570     Stiegman    The two principal goals of this research are to advance study of  the chemical parameters that effect the synthesis and processing of  multicomponent glasses by the sol-gel process, and to fabricate and  characterize entirely new metal/silica multicomponent glasses.   Three primary activities will be conducted:      1. The synthesis of new metal/silica xerogels. Several metal and  metal-centered functional groups will be incorporated into the  silica xerogel matrix using the synthetic protocol established for  the oxovanadium materials. Central to this effort is the  optimization of conditions to insure homogeneity for each metal.  The metals chosen for incorporation will be based on their  anticipated reactivity and on their position as part of a series of  systematically varying materials for the elucidation of  structure-property relationships.     2. Elucidation of the chemistry of the sol-gel process under  multicomponent conditions. This will involve determining the  effects of the metal on the kinetics and mechanism of gelation, the  processes of aging, drying and stabilization. This will provide a  fundamental understanding of the chemical processes that occur in  the solgel process when many kinetically different components are  present.     3. Characterization of the properties and reactivity of the new  multicomponent glasses.  The characterization of the hybrid  materials will entail two primary activities: (1) characterization  of the coordination geometry and electronic structure of the metal  center as it is found in the silica matrix; and (2)  characterization of the physical and morphological properties of  the bulk xerogel.   %%%  Homogeneous multicomponent glasses, comprised of differing ratios  of metal and semimetal oxides, have attracted considerable  attention due to their diverse and potentially useful properties  and reactivities. Among the applications predicted for these  materials are as heterogeneous catalysts, chemical sensors and   environmental monitors, and optical and electronics components.  While the sol-gel process has been used successfully to prepare  specific materials, problems have precluded its general employment  as a method for preparing homogeneous hybrid glasses. These  problems arise from the widely differing gelation kinetics of the  various constituents and by the many variables associated with  aging and drying these materials; all of which can lead to  heterogeneity in the final product. The aim of this work is to  optimize the conditions needed to produce a homogeneous glass, and  provide a detailed and comprehensive picture of the formation and  properties of hybrid metal/silica glasses to contribute  significantly to bringing this class of materials into the sphere  of real applications.",
