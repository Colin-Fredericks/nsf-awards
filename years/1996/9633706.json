 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conrey 9633706   This award provides partial funding for the conference \"In Celebration of the Centenary of the Prime Number Theorem: A Symposium on the Riemann Hypothesis.\" One hundred years ago, Hadamard and de la Vallee Poussin independently gave the final arguments in the proof of the Prime Number Theorem. They followed a plan that had been mapped out by Riemann some 37 years earlier. However, Riemann's goals for understanding the prime numbers are still not realized as the famous Riemann Hypothesis remains  tantalizingly unsolved. Speakers at this conference will present many of  the interesting developments that have arisen from Riemann's original  work, with an eye to understanding future research directions regarding the zeros of the Riemann zeta-function and related L-functions.  This research falls into the general mathematical field of Number Theory.  Number theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers,  addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one  whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and  was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within  the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse  applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and  communication systems.",
