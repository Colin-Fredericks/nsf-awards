 "awd_abstract_narration": "9631979    Briles      This laboratory has been studying the immune system of chickens and other birds, and has identified their erythrocyte and MHC alloantigen systems.  During the last grant period they genetically mapped and examined MHC associated fitness effects in chickens, and identified and mapped some of their leukocyte specific alloantigens.  In this proposal they will identify alloantigen systems in other captive species, including the pheasant and quail, as well as continue the genetic identification of the loci for the leukocytes specific alloantigens in the chicken.  The alloantigens will also be characterized biochemically.  They will examine the interaction between segregating alleles of these alloantigen systems and another locus that have identified, in the resistance or susceptibility to disease.  They also propose to look at these systems in other species, and this work will be done in collaboration with other investigators.  These studies are important for understanding comparative immunology, evolutionary development, and environmental adaptation of species.        ***",
