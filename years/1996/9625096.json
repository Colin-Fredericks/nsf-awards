 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625096  Schmidt    Magnetohydrodynamics (or MHD) is the theory of the macroscopic   interaction of electrically conducting fluids with a magnetic field. In the   viscous incompressible case, MHD flow is governed by the Navier-Stokes   equations and the pre-Maxwell equations of the magnetic field. The latter   will in general transcend the region of conducting fluid and, ideally, extend   to all of space. It is mostly this feature, the electromagnetic interaction of   the fluid with the outside world, which gives rise to challenging problems of    mathematical analysis and numerical approximation.  In earlier work, the   authors have developed a novel approach to viscous incompressible MHD   that avoids some intrinsic difficulties of traditional approaches by   employing fluid velocity and current density (rather than velocity and   magnetic field) as the primary variables. The velocity-current method has   been successfully applied to prove the well-posedness of certain stationary   MHD flow problems and to develop an efficient finite-element algorithm   for the numerical approximation of solutions.  One objective of the   proposed research is to extend the velocity-current method, both   analytically and numerically, to more complex stationary problems, as they   arise in liquid-metal technology and other applications. Major tools will be   integral-equation methods, mixed variational formulations, and the coupling   of finite-element and boundary-element methods. In another direction, a   suitable generalization of the velocity-current method will be employed to   analyze time-dependent MHD flow problems. Initially, the focus will be on   qualitative properties of the ensuing systems of integro-differential   equations, via Faedo-Galerkin and semigroup methods; ultimately, the goal   is again the design of efficient algorithms for the numerical approximation   of solutions in physically realistic situations.    Magnetohydrodynamics (or MHD) is the theory of the macroscopic   interaction of el ectrically conducting fluids with a magnetic field. It is of   importance in connection with many engineering problems, such as   sustained plasma confinement for controlled thermonuclear fusion, liquid-  metal cooling of nuclear reactors, and electromagnetic casting of metals. It   also finds applications in geophysics and astronomy, where one prominent   example is the so-called dynamo problem, that is, the question of the origin   of the Earth's magnetic field in its liquid metal core.  Due to their practical   relevance, MHD flow problems have long been the subject of intense cross-  disciplinary research, but except for relatively simple special cases, the   rigorous mathematical and numerical analysis of such problems is largely   terra incognita. The authors have recently developed a novel approach to an   important class of MHD flow problems that circumvents some intrinsic   difficulties of traditional analyses. The objective of the proposed research is   to further pursue this approach in order to design qualitative and   quantitative methods for the mathematically rigorous and computationally   efficient solution of MHD flow  problems in physically realistic situations.",
