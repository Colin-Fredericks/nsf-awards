Szarek  Case Western Reserve University      ABSTRACT            The project involves continued research on the geometric,  probabilistic and combinatorial aspects of functional analysis and  convexity theory.  Many of the problems considered are expressed in the  language of the asymptotic theory of finite dimensional normed spaces  or,  what is essentially equivalent, as \"isomorphic\" statements about high  dimensional convex bodies. Some questions have motivation in the theory of  operator algebras, mathematical physics, operations research,  computer  science or probability and statistics. Typical research topics include:  entropy of linear operators, existence of nontrivial linear operators on  general Banach spaces,  norms of random matrices,  some problems in the  \"local\" operator theory,  Gaussian correlation of convex sets,  balancing  vectors in normed spaces and other questions on the border of probability,  combinatorics and convexity.            On an elementary level,  analysis is a study of  \"functions\",  or  relationships, between quantities and the parameters on which they depend.  As it happens,  very many naturally appearing relationships are linear or  at least convex.   Thus a good understanding of convex functions  (and  consequently of convex sets)  is a prerequisite for understanding those  relationships.  Depending on whether the set of parameters is finite or  infinite  (the latter may also be an  \"idealization\"  of  \"very large\";  real life problems usually do depend on very many parameters),  we are  dealing with either finite dimensional convexity  or infinite  dimensional functional analysis.  The  \"isomorphic\" asymptotic theory was,  over the last twenty years  or so,  quite successful in identifying and  exploiting \"approximate\" symmetries of various problems (involving high  dimensional convex sets) that could not be analyzed with earlier more  \"rigid\" methods.  One example of a specific link to applications is a   recent  advance (in computer science) in the area of efficient computation  of volume of high dimensional convex sets,  which utilized results and  ideas from the asymptotic theory.",
