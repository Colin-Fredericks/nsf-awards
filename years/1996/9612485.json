Under this Program, the National Science  Foundation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are jointly  evaluating and supporting research of high priority to the USWRP.           The objectives of this research are to understand the mechanisms controlling  two difficult forecasting problems: intensity changes in hurricanes prior to landfall,  and the precipitation they produce after landfall.  These two problems often have a  conceptual connection, in that interactions of the hurricane with middle latitude  phenomena (fronts and/or synoptic scale mobile troughs) can produce sudden  intensification of a hurricane prior to landfall, or heavy precipitation after landfall.   It is these middle latitude interactions that will be the focus of this research.  Of  particular interest are (i) the processes by which upper tropospheric troughs interact  with hurricanes, with the goal of describing what determines whether an interaction  will intensify or weaken the hurricane; and (ii) the dynamic and thermodynamic  characteristics that control the amount and distribution of precipitation after landfall.           In addition to increased fundamental understanding of the nature of  landfalling hurricanes, a potential outcome of the work will be an identification of  common signatures of the potential for sudden deepening or localized flooding by  tropical cyclones in time to give adequate warnings.  ***",
