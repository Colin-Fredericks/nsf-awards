The R/V ISELIN a 170' general research vessel  owned and constructed by the University of Miami is out of service  following a grounding in 1994.  The University intends to sale the  vessel.  The  CALANUS is a 68' general research vessel owned by the  University of Miami.  The CALANUS is scheduled for 87 days in 1996  of which 24 are in support of NSF-sponsored research.  The Calanus  will do a series of short cruises of the coast of Miami with three  cruises in the Bahamas.         The CALANUS is part of a fleet used by NSF to support  oceanographic research.  Most oceanographic research requires  highly specialized equipment that must be permanently installed on  a ship for which the ship must be specifically designed.  This  equipment also requires highly trained crew members for maintenance  and operation.  These vessels do not operate in the same manner as  general cargo or fishing vessels, therefore NSF supports the  operation of a variety of vessels specifically dedicated to  oceanographic research that are operated by universities and  research institutions around the country.  ***",
