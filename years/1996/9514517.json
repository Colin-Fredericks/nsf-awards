The meeting will bring together scientists with expertise in various aspects of avian endocrinology ranging from molecular biology to field ecology. The meeting will include sessions devoted to osmoregulation, reproduction, neuroendocrinology, growth, embryonic development, calcium metabolism, behavior, regulation of cellular function, sexual differentiation, intermediary metabolism, circadian rhythms and conservation. The meeting will attract approximately 400 scientists from more than 20 countries in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. Attendance by students from developing countries will be sponsored to facilitate development of communication between established laboratories and newly formed research groups. The proceedings of the meeting will be published by the Journal of Endocrinology and will serve as the most recent comprehensive account of advances in avian endocrinology. The meeting will provide a unique opportunity for scientists whose work involves birds to exchange ideas and develop the international network of specialists in the field.   ***",
