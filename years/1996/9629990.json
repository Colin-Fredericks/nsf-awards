The theme of the proposed research is to address uncertainties surrounding the properties of Cr4+ materials through high pressure luminescence, excitation, and lifetime measurements to relate luminescence properties to crystal field strength, and to understand the effect of interstate mixing on luminescence properties. Related studies of isoelectronic Mn5+ , currently known to occur only as a strong field ion in a few oxides will also be considered in the project. %%% The project is interdisciplinary combining fundamental materials chemistry and materials science synthesis and processing studies with advanced characterization tools and analysis methods to address forefront issues in a topical area of strong technological relevance and high potential payoff.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to several aspects of advanced photonic devices critical to high bandwidth communications technology.  Additionally, the knowledge and understanding gained from this research project is expected to contribute in a general way to improving the performance of advanced devices and communications systems by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved materials, and materials combinations.  An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***",
