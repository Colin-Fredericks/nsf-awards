 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal: 9623313  PI: Kellogg and Farnsworth    A  comprehensive understanding of mechanisms of seed  drying  and  dormancy is critical to developing appropriate storage,  planting,  and  germination protocols for  farms,  arboreta,  botanical   gardens,  and  seed  conservation  banks.    The  evolution  of desiccation-intolerance, and its developmental  manifestations, vivipary and recalcitrance, will be  studied  in  seeds  of  four  phylogenetically  independent  mangrove  lineages.  Embryos of dormant (orthodox) seeds normally lose  water  prior to entering metabolic quiescence; by  contrast,  \"recalcitrant\" seeds that are intolerant of desiccation show  no  dormancy,  and some sprout viviparously  on  the  parent  plant.  While rare among upland angiosperms, this phenomenon  appears  frequently among coastal mangroves, rice, and  wet-  forest  trees,  with important implications for  agriculture  and  seed  conservation.  We hypothesize  that  desiccation-  intolerance   results   from  one   of   three   alternative  evolutionary modifications that are not mutually  exclusive:  (1)  decreased  levels of the plant hormone  abscisic  acid,  ABA,  during  embryogenesis  (which  controls  both  osmotic  adjustment  of the whole plant to flooding, and dormancy  in  orthodox   seeds);  (2)  differential  levels  of   dehydrin  proteins,  carbohydrate  reserves,  or  other  hormones   in  recalcitrant  seeds; (3) altered anatomy of the  seed  coat,  maternal  transfer tissues, or embryo/endosperm relationship  that  may  free  the embryo from influences of  physical  or  biochemical  germination inhibitors.  To  test  among  these  hypotheses, we will examine the hormonal, physiological, and  anatomical bases of desiccation-intolerance that are  shared  among four viviparous mangrove families, in a study of seeds  through  development and germination.  Seeds  of  viviparous  species will be compared with seeds of closely related, non-  viviparous  taxa to determine whether similar,  functionall y  significant  changes in seed structure and  physiology  have  arisen  consistently in this pattern of parallel  evolution.  This  integrated approach will elucidate the nature of  this  evolutionary  convergence  at  several  biological   levels;  clarify  relationships between anatomy, hormonal physiology,  proteins   and   sugar  metabolism  during  development   of  viviparous and orthodox seeds; and provide some of the first  documentation  of the role of hormones in the  evolution  of  plant  life histories.  These comparative data on  multiple,  interacting   factors   controlling   seed   dormancy    and  recalcitrance  can  usefully  inform  strategies  for  plant  conservation, propagation, and agriculture.",
