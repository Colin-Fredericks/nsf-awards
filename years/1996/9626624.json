They occur ubiquitously in  mathematics and its applications and are among the most important  objects of study in all of mathematics.  Their most observable  topological properties are that of being finite dimensional, locally  contractible, having the local homology of euclidean n-space, and  allowing nicely embedded subspaces to be put in general position.  A  space is called a generalized n-manifold if it satisfies all of these  properties, except possibly the last.  If in addition, n is at least 5  and X allows general position, X is said to satisfy the disjoint disks  property (DDP).  The long standing conjecture that a generalized  n-manifold X having the DDP must be a topological manifold was  disproved recently by the investigators in joint work with S. C. Ferry  and Shmuel Weinberger.  Among the most significant questions that  remain concerning generalized manifolds and that are the subject of  this project is the question of whether generalized manifolds are  topologically homogeneous.  Other goals are to establish other  structure theorems for DDP generalized manifolds that are known to  hold for topological manifolds, such as the s-cobordism theorem,  various splitting theorems, and regular neighborhood theorems.  Splitting theorems, in particular, would be useful in attacking the  conjecture that the pathology exhibited by generalized manifolds  resides in dimension 4.       It has been quite a shock for topologists to learn that  n-dimensional manifolds are not characterized by a small collection of  their most obvious properties, as had been conjectured.  Since these  spaces are the most heavily used in mathematics, it is highly  desirable to understand this phenomenon better.  The two  co-investigators, who were among the four who dispatched the  conjecture several years ago, are now intent on doing just this.  As  mentioned above, they will attempt to le arn whether, like ordinary  topological manifolds, generalized manifolds exhibit the same  topological structure in the vicinity of each of their points.  The  interest of these spaces arises from their potential as models for  several phenomena observed in the study of dynamical systems,  geometric group theory, and other areas, but lack of such homogeneity  would seriously limit this potential.  ***",
