 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work, directed by Assistant Professor Robert T. Kennedy of the   University of Florida, is centered on problems of qualitative and   quantitative measurement of chemicals associated with neurotransmission   processes in the central nervous system.   Support is provided by the   Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division.    Miniaturized sampling systems coupled to capillary separation techniques   will be developed with the long range goal of high speed in vivo   measurements.  Both microdialysis and push-pull perfusion will be   investigated as sampling systems.  On-line chemical derivatization will   yield products suitable for laser induced fluorescence detection or   electrochemical detection.  The latter uses the biuret reaction to form   Cu(II) complexes with peptide neurotransmitters.  To enhance sensitivity,   a dual electrode detector arrangment will be used in which the complex   recycles back and forth between the anode and cathode.  An understanding of the chemical basis of the functioning of the nervous   system would be of great benefit in the treatment of neurological   diseases.  To achieve this, it is necessary to identify and quantify the   chemicals involved and to be able to follow their changes temporily and   spatially.  The major objective of this project is to provide solutions   to the measurement problems presented by the  small volumes, the low   concentrations, the presence of a large number of different chemicals and   the short response time that are encountered in such investigations.",
