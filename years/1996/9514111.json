 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to enhance our understanding of the conditions under which  women have children at an early age, the  conditions under which women delay having children,  and conditions that may enhance or inhibit a woman's ability to access opportunities for   education and employment. Data will be gathered from an American Indian  population and will  provide important additions to existing knowledge  about human behavior and reproduction.        There are three specific research  objectives: 1) to identify the social, economic, and  health factors that  facilitate reproduction for the study population; 2) to construct a data set of  women's life histories and develop a model of the relationship  between the timing of  reproduction, the availability of education and  employment opportunities, and the availability of  physiological, social,  and economic resources necessary for successful childrearing; and 3) test   hypotheses about the timing of reproduction over a woman's life course.  This research explores  an option for reproduction among poor women which coordinates limited but early reproduction  supported by family networks and later acquisition of education and employment opportunities.",
