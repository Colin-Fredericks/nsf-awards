The proposal   consists of two parts. The first part intends to give a rigorous   answer to an open question whether there exist solitary internal   waves with algebraic decay at infinity in a continuously stratified   fluid that is bounded only by a rigid bottom and has a constant   density except for a layer with continuous density stratification.   The proposed research will give a rigorous justification of the   existence of solitary waves derived from a formal model equation,   called the Benjamin-Ono equation. The second part deals with the   existence of periodic waves of large amplitude in a two-layer fluid   without boundaries. A new formulation of the problem will be introduced,   which transforms the governing equations into a single integral equation.   Then the solutions of the integral equation will be studied numerically   and theoretically for any density ratio without restrictions on the   amplitude of solutions. In this project, the main thrust is to show   that the fully nonlinear governing equations for stratified fluids   have solutions of finite and large amplitude and give the various   properties of the solutions using numerical and theoretical approaches.   An interplay of theories in differential equations and functional analysis   will be essential to obtaining the rigorous justifications, while   numerical computation gives some crucial information on the solutions.  %%%         The gravity waves of large amplitude in a fluid of density variation,   also called a stratified fluid, with great depth are of considerable   geophysical interest. Large amplitude internal wave disturbances are   common features in the oceans as well as in the lower atmosphere. In   particular, a solitary wave, whose form is a localized single hump,   and a periodic wave, which always has  a same form after a certain   distance, are relevant to various oceanic and atmospherical phenomena.   The solitary waves of large amplitude have been associated with the   formation of tornados in the atmosphere and the enormous transport of   momentum and energy within the oceans. This work focuses on obtaining   the conditions under which the solitary or periodic waves can exist and   predicting how large the amplitude of the waves can be if they exist.   It will also try to capture the qualitative features of these waves   using numerical computations. The results obtained from this research   may provide some theoretical explanation of the formation of these waves   and give more understanding of certain wave motions in the oceans   and atmosphere so that these waves may be either utilized or avoided   in different physical applications.    ***",
