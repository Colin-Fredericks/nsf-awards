 "awd_abstract_narration": "HRD-9632844  Clark Atlanta University    A renewal proposal has been submitted on behalf of the Center  for Theoretical Studies of Physical Systems (CTSPS) at Clark  Atlanta University (CAU).  During its first 4 plus years of  existence, CTSPS has become a regional resource center  surpassing all of its objectives: prosecution of forefront,  basic and applied, research; production of significant numbers  of peer reviewed publications; presentation of research  results at national and international conferences; creation of  a sophisticated research computing facility, including the  most powerful CRAY platform in Georgia; acquisition of $6.2  million dollars in non-NSF federal funding; formation of  academic/corporate research-educational partnerships support  of research faculty from the Atlanta University Center (AUC);  hiring of key researchers to coordinate and stimulate new  interdisciplinary interactions; creation of a vital visiting  scientists program; support for important local, national, and  international conferences; production of significant numbers  of Ph.D. bound minority students; creation of a Mobile  Physics/Mathematics Demonstration Unit; and promotion of  technology transfer in important areas such as infrared sensor  technology, and image processing (to name a few).  These  accomplishments have catapulted CAU s research capacity into  a nationally competitive research center of excellence.  CTSPS  has become a paradigm for quality, cost-effective, research  and research training in the physical and mathematical  sciences, within the AUC.  It has positioned CAU s physics  department to become one of the outstanding computational  physics programs in the nation.  Efficient use of NSF funded  resources has allowed CTSPS to leverage non-NSF support for  expensive items (i.e. powerful computers, etc.), all dedicated  to solving important problems in diverse areas.  The  establishment of a world class research center, within an HBCU  environment, continues to positively impact the  student body,  attracting many CAU/AUC students from all SEM disciplines.   Accordingly, CTSPS is a genuine national resource whose  continued funding would insure the consolidation and growth of  a vital and nationally important research enterprise (in the  context of a newly created HCU institution) contributing to  the nation s technological readiness, and serving as a vital  professional role model to the underrepresented minorities in  the sciences, engineering, and mathematics.",
