In   particular, VN(G) is injective if and only if G is amenable. The proposer   and Uffe Haagerup have defined a property for locally compact groups   (called the approximation property, or AP) which is weaker than   amenability, and have shown that a discrete group G has the AP if and   only if VN(G) has the weak* operator approximation property (the weak*   OAP).  The weak* OAP is a normal matricial version (for dual operator   spaces) of the approximation property for Banach spaces. A dual operator   space has the weak* OAP if and only if it satisfies the slice map   property for arbitrary weak* closed subspaces of B(H), and so von Neumann   algebras with the weak* OAP behave well with respect to taking tensor   products with such subspaces. Notions of amenabilty have been defined for   homogeneous spaces, correspondences and Kac algebras. The proposer has   defined appropriate versions of the AP in each of these cases and during   this project will investigate a number of problems concerning the weak*   OAP and approximation properties for groups, homogeneous spaces,   correspondences and Kac algebras.    Von Neumann algebras are an important tool in the study of quantum   mechanics and quantum field theory, and also play an important role in   the study of group representations (which themselves are used in quantum   physics). The von Neumann algebras that arise in these applications are   usually infinite dimensional spaces. One way of obtaining information   about the structure and properties of such infinite dimensional objects   is to approximate them in an appropriate way by finite dimensional   objects. The approximation properties of von Neumann algebras that will   be investigated in this project are of this type. The weakest (least   restrictive) such property is weak enough that it is satisfied by a  large   class of von Neumann algebras, but strong enough that knowing it is valid   gives us important information about the von Neumann algebra. In the case   of discrete groups, much is known about the connection between properties   of the groups and approximation properties of the associated von Neumann   algebras. The theory of Kac algebras can be viewed as a generalization of   the theory of group representations. One of the goals of this project is   to investigate to what extent the results concerning approximation   properties for groups can be extended to the more general setting of    Kac algebras.",
