The  objective  of  this  project  is to understand the interaction  between  ice  surfaces  and  other  solids  in  a  controlled  environment   at  temperatures near the triple point. Dynamical measurements of the  normal  and lateral forces exerted on scanning mechanical  probes  by  the surface of ice will be made as a function of temperature,  atmosphere above the ice surface, and electric potential  between  the  probe  and the ice. The fundamental information obtained  by  such  microscopic  scale measurements will aid  in  understanding  macroscopic  mechanical  interactions between  ice  surfaces  and  other solids.      %%%    Ice is important in a number of environments on the earth, in the  atmosphere, on other planets, and in space. The objective of this  project  is to learn what happens when an ice surface comes  into  contact   with   a  microscopic  solid  probe  in  a   controlled  environment  at  temperatures near the triple  point.  The  probe  could  be  a  very  sharp point or a very small diameter  sphere;  forces  exerted  on the probe as it comes into contact  with  the  surface  will  be  measured by deflecting a  laser  beam  from  a  microscopic lever. The fundamental information obtained  by  such  measurements will aid in understanding large scale forces between  ice  surfaces and other solids such as occur in the  adhesion  of  ice to obiects in a cold environment.  ***",
