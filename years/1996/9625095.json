 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Morrison - 9625095    Research Portion:  The goal of this research is to develop a new, fundamental understanding of the chemistry found in radio frequency (RF) induction plasmas using novel in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) diagnostics.  The research will initially investigate methane plasmas and the growth of amorphous carbon films (diamondlike carbon or DLC) while performing the in situ FTIR measurements.  Although well known for their hardness, recent preliminary research indicates that these films would be outstanding gas permeation barriers and useful in field emission displays.      Education Portion:  Engineering education has a mismatch between the learning styles of the students and the teaching styles of the faculty.  In addition, the students have difficulty grasping the interdisciplinary nature of chemical engineering which draws on concepts from mathematics, chemistry, physics, and other engineering disciplines.  To address these issues, the education plan will begin developing hypertexted class notes for an undergraduate class in fluid mechanics.  Hypertexted class notes allow the learning process to adapt to the learning style of the student as well as provide much opportunity for feedback to the instructor; it also frees the instructor to spend class time demonstration problem solving skills rather than writing on the board.  As the hypertexting grows, links to other course work becomes possible, emphasizing the multidisciplinary nature of engineering.",
