Consequently, x-ray diffraction continues to  play a vital role in the synthesis, fabrication and  characterization of advanced materials and in materials  processing.  This award provides support for an  x-ray  diffraction system to be housed in the University of  Minnesota X-ray Diffraction Facility.  X-ray diffraction is  an integral part of numerous University research programs  related to materials research, and the Facility has actually  served eighteen different universities, at least fourteen  industrial research laboratories and programs affiliated  with the National Science Foundation's Center for  Interfacial Engineering.  The requested equipment will  replace an aging Siemens diffractometer which poses safety  hazards and has performance limitations.  The system  represents a significant improvement in the Facility's  capabilities, providing a rotating anode source for faster  sample throughput (imperative for a multi-user facility),  and control of sample environment.  This acquisition will  substantially benefit several key principal investigators  whose research programs involve materials research, as well  as a substantial user community composed of academic and  industrial scientists.  ***",
