 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514351  Beuchat    Hummingbirds  have  the  highest  metabolic  rate   of   any  vertebrate, and they fuel this tremendous metabolism  almost  entirely with the sugar found in nectar.  Supporting a  high  metabolic rate on liquid diet presents these birds with some  special physiological problems. Most obviously, hummingbirds  must  consume tremendous quantities of nectar,  up  to  five  times  the  bird's  own  body  mass  per  day!   Then,   the  gastrointestinal tract must be able to extract,  with  great  efficiency, the sugar and other nutrients in the  nectar  as  it passes rapidly through the bird.  The kidney must also be  able to filter and excrete excess water to avoid dilution of  body  fluids.  Finally, because concentrations of salts  and  minerals in nectar are typically low but are needed  by  the  bird, the amounts excreted in the urine must be minimal.    This  research  investigates the ways in which  hummingbirds  deal   simultaneously   with  these  extreme   physiological  challenges  of fluid, electrolyte, and energy balance.   The  study  focuses not only on understanding fundamental aspects  of  the  physiology  of the kidney and intestinal  tract  in  hummingbirds,  but  also  on how these  organ  systems  play  coordinated roles in the physiological maintenance of energy  and  osmotic  homeostasis.  The work is further extended  by  considering the integration of renal and intestinal function  with hummingbird biology at the organismal level in a series  of  questions that address the interface of physiology  with  behavior, morphology, and ecology, and evolution.    Much  of what comparative physiology has contributed to  our  understanding  of  osmoregulation in terrestrial  birds  and  mammals   has  been  based  upon  studies  of  the  ultimate  concentrators, the desert rodents, and only a few species of  birds.   We  know relatively little, by contrast, about  the  special  osmoregulatory problems faced by birds and  mammals  for  which  the challenge is an exc ess of water rather  than  desiccation.   This study is unusual in the breadth  of  its  perspective and its simultaneous consideration of  processes  from  the cellular level to that of the animal in the field.  It is  the first study to closely examine the osmoregulatory  physiology of a bird or mammal that is a model organism  for  the study of diuresis in vertebrates.",
