The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Martin D. Olson and Dr. Randy Thaman of the  University of the South Pacific in Suva, Fiji.        The purpose of this project is to investigate the  differences between environmental policies and practices in  various historical, geographic, ecological and political  contexts within Fiji, focusing on governing institutions,  their forms and the ways in which they are politically and  socially constituted, the evolution of their policies and  interrelations at various levels of local, state and  regional authority, and their influence in shaping what  people do in land and sea.        ***",
