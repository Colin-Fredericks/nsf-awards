Dr. Newton-Williams will work with Dr. Nobuo  Nakabayashi, Director of the Division of Organic Materials,  on a research project entitled \"In Vitro Evaluation of a  Phospholipid Polymer for Medical Device Applications.\"      The proposed research will evaluate the use of  (methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) MPC copolymers as a  surface enhancement to improve the performance of implants  and inhibiting bacterial adhesion and cell attachment.  The  success of  percutaneous implant devices has been limited  due to attachment of the skin cells to the implant and  excessive tissue growth around the implant.  The implants  also fail due to infection when bacteria adhere to the  implant surface and gain access to the underlying tissue  through the area between the skin and the implant.  The  objective of this research is to improve implant performance  through the incorporation of  an MPC copolymer and the  prevention of cell and bacterial attachment.  Different  methods of incorporating MPC polymers onto the surface of  the bulk material will be examined.  The distribution of MPC  and the integrity of the MPC on the material surface will be  evaluated during research, as well as in vitro protein  adsorption, cellular attachment, and bacterial adherence.  ***",
