 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern introductory statistics courses are moving toward more emphasis on data analysis and the practice of statistics, with correspondingly less emphasis on mathematical manipulations. Within the data analysis view, however, one must still emphasize basic statistical concepts such as the role of randomness, sampling distributions, confidence and significance. Since these ideas cannot be explained by appealing to formal mathematics, they must be explained through intuitive arguments using data and simulation. Technology, then, becomes an essential tool for the teaching of concepts, as well as for the analysis of real data. Much good software and supporting material is available for the latter, but little attention has been paid to developing software and attendant material for the former.    This project will make use of the hands-on activities developed under the Activity-Based Statistics Project (USE-9150836) and the ExplorStat software developed under the project on Constructing Knowledge of Statistical Concepts Through Modern Technology (DUE-9354419) to develop, field test, and publish a series of hands-on, self-directed laboratory lessons for discovery-based learning of fundamental statistical concepts. It is anticipated that 15 to 20 lessons will be needed to adequately lead the student through the concepts covered in most introductory courses. For teaching situations in which a computer laboratory is not available, these lessons can serve as the basis for classroom demonstrations of these concepts.    Although the primary focus for the project is undergraduate statistics, these materials will be of use to high school teachers who are now emphasizing statistics as part of the mathematics curriculum, especially those who will participate in the new Advanced Placement Statistics program.",
