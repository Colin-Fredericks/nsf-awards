 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a three-year research program to investigate the nature of  a newly discovered ionospheric source for ion energization and  transport.  The topic of ion energization is one of paramount  importance in magnetospheric physics because ions carry the bulk of  the particle energy and thereby play a central role in the molding  of that environment.  The proposed program directly addresses one  of the most puzzling problems of ion energization - that is, how  are heavy (O+) ions accelerated at low altitudes in the ionosphere  and transported upward in large numbers to the magnetosphere?  This  question is crucial because (1) the abundance of O+  ions found  throughout the magnetosphere requires some means by which large  fluxes of thermal ions are transported upward from the ionosphere,  and (2) thermal-ions upflows (TIU) and transversely accelerated  ions (TAI) have been observed at altitudes as low as 400 km in the  ionosphere.  Other observations have demonstrated the existence of  at least one class of TIU events that is characterized by the  absence of ion frictional heating and the presence of elevated  electron temperature, features that cannot be easily explained by  known mechansisms.  These findings indicate that the process  responsible for the transport of large fluxes of terrestrial ions  to the magnetosphere has not yet been identified.  We have recently described a new, ion energization souce  Tsunoda  and Kagan, 1995  that appears to be the missing mechanism.  The new  source consists of Lrentz-type forces that arise because of the  presence of a perturbation magnetic field, for example, that  associated with a large-scale field-aligned current system.  This  perturbation magnetic field acts together with a latituinal  pressure gradient or current (directed orthogonal to one another  and transverse to B) to produce a Lorentz-type force in a direction  parallel or antiparallel to B.  As described by Tsunoda and Kagan   1995 , and in this proposal, this mechanism is capable of   accounting for the class of TIU events that occur without ion  heating.  More exciting however, is the likelihood that these  field-aligned Lorentz forces can account for a number of related  but still puzzling observations including (1) TIUs produced by ion  heating, (2) the transport of molecular ions into the  magnetosphere, (3) the triggering of the ion-cyclotron and ion-  acoustic instabilities, (4) the transverse acceleration of ions by  electrostatic ion-cyclotron waves, (5) the development of ion-  acoustic turbulence and anomalous resistivity, and (6) elevated  electron temperatures in upward field-aligned current regions.  Given the potential of field-aligned Lorentz forces for explaining  a variety of ion-acceleration-related phenomena, an investigation  of a larger database of incoherent scatter radar data will be  undertaken of determine if the observations support the predictions  of this novel theory.",
