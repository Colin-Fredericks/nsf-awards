 "awd_abstract_narration": "Elliot Bernstein of Colorado State University is supported by the   Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study radical-closed shell   molecule reactions relevant to atmospheric and combustion chemistry.    Specifically, Prof. Bernstein will study radicals prevalent in mildly   oxidizing environments such as methyl, hydroxy, and nitrate radicals and   their reactions with ethylene.  He will generate the radical-molecule   complex initially in its ground electronic state, where the barrier is   high enough to inhibit reaction, then optically excite the complex to an   excited (barrier-less) electronic state to initiate reaction.  He will   employ time-resolved optical/mass spectrometric techniques to follow the   reaction.   Finally, ab initio calculations will be exploited to generate   reaction potential energy surfaces.    The implications of this line of research are many-fold.  These studies   will provide important details about reaction dynamics; the reactions to   be studied are particularly relevant in the areas of combustion and   atmospheric chemistry.  The cluster environment will yield unique details   not readily obtainable in the gas- or bulk-phase, and new techniques for   generating radicals in clusters will be explored and developed.",
