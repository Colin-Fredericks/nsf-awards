 "awd_abstract_narration": "9633207  Mason    Mercury is one of the few metals which can be said to be a  pollutant on a global scale.  Anthropogenic inputs of gaseous Hg0  to the atmosphere, estimated to be three to four times the natural  terrestrial flux, reach even the remote ocean due to the slowness  of Hg0 oxidation in the effective transport of atmospheric Hg), the  most important source of Hg in the oligotrophic ocean is aeolian  deposition of oxidized Hg scavenged from the atmosphere.  One of  the key reactions which determines the global fate of anthropogenic  Hg is the reduction of aeolian deposits of oxidized Hg2+ to Hg0 in  the ocean.  Evidence that the reduction of Hg2+ in marine waters  occurs in the euphotic zone produced in fresh, estuarine and ocean  surface waters at rates which are quite variable (0.2 to 10% per  day) by mechanisms which are poorly understood. This work will seek  to determine the mechanisms which are environmentally significant  and the conditions under which  Hg is reduced and oxidized in  natural waters. Hg2+ reduction is likely to be a complex process,  necessitating both an in-depth understanding of photochemical  reactions in natural waters and experience studying the interaction  of trace metals with bota.  The approach will uniquely combine  abiotic photochemical studies and estimates of biologically  medicated Hg2+ reduction rates at realistic trace concentrations of  Hg2+.",
