There is a correlation between the organized and  heterogametic sex in these groups; males are organized (lose  the ability to display female-typical behavior) in mammals,  whereas females are organized (lose the ability to display  male-typical behavior) in birds.  The opposite sex retains  the capacity to display both female- and male-typical  behavior.  A similar correlation is observed in other  vertebrates with genotypic sex determination.  Alternate  explanations are (1) that a developmental constraint results  in organization of the heterogametic sex, or (2) that there  is a functional relationship between organization and  gonochorism.  Reptiles with environmental sex determination  do not fit into the constraint paradigm because they lack a  heterogametic sex.  In contrast, these species may be  organized if organization is adaptive.  In this study,  manipulation of embryonic temperature (and thereby gonadal  sex) and adult hormones will be performed to distinguish  among hypotheses about organization.  Log-linear,  multivariate, and path analyses will be used to analyze  reproductive and  aggressive behaviors.  Results will (1)  illuminate the proximate cause of behavioral variation in an  ESD species, and (2) for the first time delineate and test  alternate hypotheses about the evolutionary causes of  behavioral organization in the context of sex determining  mechanisms.",
