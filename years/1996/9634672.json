 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reduction of interior sound radiation in enclosed  environments such as in helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and  land vehicles is a very important problem. There are two  mainstream techniques for dealing with this problem. One is  the active noise cancellation method (ANC) using  loudspeakers, and the other is sound radiation reduction  strategy via structural controls (often called active  structural acoustic control or ASAC). This research project  deals with the development of a mathematical theory for the  acoustic boundary control method and to analytically and  experimentally demonstrate the advantages of a new acoustic  boundary actuation method over the existing ones. The  specific research tasks include a study of the spatial  characteristics of acoustic boundary control; development of  a neural network for selecting optimal spatial  configurations; development of hardware prototypes of  sensing and actuation devices for implementing acoustic  boundary control; and evaluation of existing feedforward  adaptive and feedback control algorithms in conjunction with  the acoustic boundary control strategy. The results obtained  from this research project will lead to the development of  technologies for eliminating interior noise of the vehicles,  and the generation of important theoretical groundwork that  will enable technology development for reducing exterior  noise radiation.",
