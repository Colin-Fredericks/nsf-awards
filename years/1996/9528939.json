 "awd_abstract_narration": "9528939  Picardal    This is an award to support preliminary work on biological  processes for degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls.  The  investigator plans on developing appropriate analytical  procedures, isolating cultures of organisms capable of  biologically degrading these compounds and finally to conduct  studies on the anaerobic dehalogenation capacity of sludges  derived from treatment of domestic wastewater, sediments and  soils.    The proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to  NSF 94-147, Research Planning Grants and Career Advancement  Awards for Minority Scientists and Engineers.  Results are  expected to provide information that can be used in determining  the feasibility of the process to be studied and the basis for a  more comprehensive research project that would determine  conditions and engineering design parameters for a biologically  based process to remove polychlorinated biphenyls from  contaminated soils and sediments and from sludges derived from  treatment of municipal and industrial wastewater.",
