 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  The work proposed, `Synthesis of Higher Alcohols from Synthesis Gas through Modified Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis`,  is a collaboration in chemical engineering between West Virginia University (WVU) and the Central Fuel Research Institute (CFRI) in India.  The investigators are Professors Dadyburjor, Kugler of WVU and Drs. Roy, Sharma of CFIR.  The goals of the research are to develop catalysts and processes for the production of high-molecular-weight, branched alcohols from synthesis gas.  This includes preparation and characterization of the catalysts, and testing under reaction conditions.  The kinetics and mechanism are to be studied, to help in the design of improved catalysts.   Characterization and reaction studies will be run in both locations.  The studies are complementary, in that experimental facilities that are unavailable at CFRI are available at WVU and vice versa.  The results of the proposed work are of value in both countries.  In the US higher alcohols can be used in reformulated gasoline, while in India they can be substituted for tetraethyl lead in gasoline or used as a feedstock for mixed olefins.    Scope:  This is a new collaboration with the unique feature of linking a university laboratory in the US with a government research laboratory in India.  Such laboratories are among the most important centers in India for their effectiveness in conducting research that is of value to economic and industrial development.  The CFRI group is highly experienced in the synthesis of olefins and other selected chemicals.",
