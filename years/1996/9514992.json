The study will test the importance of the   teacher-child relationship, peer relations, and linkages   between home and school as mediators between experiences in   the home and competence in school for children from   socioeconomically disadvantaged families with varying   degrees of social/parenting risk.  The proposed   investigation involves up to three waves of school-based   data collection and concurrent observation and/or interview   of a sample of 192 children and their urban, low-income   families who were observed and assessed during infancy and   early childhood.  Data will include: (1) annual teacher   ratings and school records for children in kindergarten   through second grade, (2) annual phone interviews with a   second parent figure, (3) home visits at 5-5.5 and 7-7.5   years, and (4) phone interviews with mothers in years when a   home visit has not taken place.  The cross-sectional and   longitudinal data will be used to test hypotheses about: (1)   the predictive importance of the teacher-child relationship,   peer relations, and home-school links for classroom   motivation and competence, (2) developmental and familial   antecedents of these critical social relations, and (3) the   specific role of child sociability and verbal competence,   close relationships with parent figures, and child social   status among siblings as protective factorq for early school   success among children from higher-risk families.  %%%  This study examines the role of social relationships at home   and at school in promoting early school success among   children who are at risk for problems and failure in school.    The relationships of importance in this study are those   between the child and his or her mother, a second \"parent   figure,\" the child's teacher, and other children in the   classr oom.  Each will be tested as an important link between   the child's experiences growing up in an urban, low-income   family with some degree of social problems and his or her   competence in the school setting.  Data will be collected in   schools, and the children and their families will be   observed and interviewed in their homes.  The same children   were previously observed and assessed during infancy and   early childhood.  The data will be used to test the   importance of the teacher-child relationship, peer   relations, and home-school links for predicting classroom   motivation and competence, and to identify protective   factors for early school success among children from higher-  risk families.  ***",
