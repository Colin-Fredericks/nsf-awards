Force  microscope  tips  with  deposited  magnetic  impurities will be used to place defects of a known type at known  positions  in a mesoscopic sample. The effect of spin  scattering  from  these  artificially introduced defects will be studied  via  conductance fluctuations and Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in narrow  wires  and  rings.  These experiments will provide  insight  into  inelastic  scattering  processes  in  small  devices,  and  offer  sensitive tests of universal conductance fluctuation theory.  The  ability  to  probe and manipulate the defects in nanoscale  wires  and  devices will ultimately allow the investigation of  disorder  in quantum transport at the single defect level.  %%%  This  research  program will apply techniques  from  the  rapidly  growing  field  of  scanning probe microscopy to  the  study  and  manipulation of defects in nanoscale electronic devices.  In  the  past,  electrical  measurements have only been sensitive  to  the  average  properties of a device, rather than  to  the  individual  defects  out  of  which the average behavior  is  built  up.  The  ability   of  scanned  probe  microscopes  to  provide  spatially  resolved,  local  information will allow us to look  beneath  the  general  properties  to  the underlying behavior  on  the  atomic  scale.  This  information  will  provide  new  physical  insights  unobtainable by any other means---insights which will be required  for  predicting  and  understanding the nano-electronics  of  the  future   in  which  the  atomic-scale  disorder  will  inevitably  influence the behavior of nominally \"identical\" devices.  ***",
