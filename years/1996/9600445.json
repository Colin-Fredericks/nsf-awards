 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal centers around nuclear theory and its  application to issues of importance in astrophysics and  particle physics. Traditionally, the atomic nucleus is  viewed as a system of neutrons and protons -- the nucleons.  The interactions between nucleons lead to a variety of  collective properties, involving neutrons and protons moving  coherently.  Projects to understand why many nuclei exhibit  collective behavior typical of an enharmonic vibrator and to  assess the role of proton-neutron collective pair  correlations in nuclei near the proton drip line are  proposed.  Despite the enormous success of the traditional  picture, there is now great interest in going one step  deeper, to obtain a consistent picture of nuclei directly  from the quark constituents of the nucleon.  Baryon mappings  have been suggested as a practical approach for realizing  this goal.  Several issues related to implementation of this  method will be investigated, followed by detailed  applications to real nuclear systems. Nuclear physics also  plays an important role in efforts to extract information of  fundamental importance in astrophysics. Two such  applications will be considered -- a study of the response  of a proposed iodine detector to solar neutrinos and a  treatment of the beta decays associated with r- and p-  process nucleosynthesis.",
