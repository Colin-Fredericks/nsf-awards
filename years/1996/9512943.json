 "awd_abstract_narration": "A multi-user phosphorimager is requested by a group of  investigators in the Department of Plant Biology and the Center for  Agricultural Biotechnology. This instrument is often referred to as a  fast, accurate, filmless autoradiography system. It facilitates the  rapid and sensitive quantitation of radioactivity on gels or blots  without scintillation counting or autoradiography. Highly sensitive  storage phosphor screens capture the image of the experimental sample  ten times faster than film. The broad linear dynamic range of the  phosphoimager permits quantitative detection of both strong and weak  signals in a way that film simply cannot. Digital images are compiled  and analyzed with a microcomputer. We propose to use this powerful  instrumentation in a wide range of applications, including the  quantitative analyses of DNA-protein interactions by gel retardation,  measurement of transcript levels by RNA gel blots or RNase protection  assays, and kinetic measurements of enzyme activity and protein  phosphorylation. The acquisition of a phosphorimager will permit us to  obtain quantitative information and answers to research questions that  would otherwise be impossible to obtain using conventional X-ray film  and autoradiography. Six of the seven investigators are currently  supported by competitive grants from federal agencies. In all cases,  the proposed experiments requiring analyses by the phosphorimager are  essential to the long-range goals of understanding the molecular basis  for plant pathogenesis, signal transduction, membrane transport and  mitosis.",
