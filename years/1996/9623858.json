 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623858  Imai      The  mechanism of high temperature superconductivity in  doped  copper oxides is still highly controversial. The  fundamental difficulty  lies in  the  fact that strong  carrier-carrier correlation effects  do  not allow  us to  describe the normal metallic state above Tc based on  the  conventional   wisdom.   Moreover,  the  magnetism   and  statistical properties of the undoped parent antiferro-  magnetic insulators are hard to  understand.  Recently,  a  new NMR  (Nuclear  Magnetic  Resonance) spectrometer  has  been  designed and  developed  at  the  Center  for  Materials  Science  and  Engineering at  M.I.T.  The  spectrometer  is ideally  suited  to  investigate carrier-  carrier correlation  effects, metal-insulator  transitions,  magnetic and statistical  properties  of quasi  2d  quantum  spin systems, the symmetry of the  superconducting order  parameter,  and related phenomena. In the proposed  project,  a variety  of high Tc copper oxide superconductors and  related materials will be studied using the spectrometer  with particular emphasis on NMR experiments at elevated  temperatures.    %%%    The nuclear magnetic resonance technique is an ideal  microscopic, nondestructive probe into the physical and  chemical properties of solids. Recently, a new NMR  spectrometer has been developed at the Center  for Materials  Science  and Engineering at M.I.T. The spectrometer  allows  one  to  conduct  unique experiments to investigate  high  temperature superconductors   and  related  materials.  Most  notably,   difficult experiments  at elevated temperatures  can be conducted  in  a  routine manner. In the proposed  project, the NMR spectrometer will be utilized to  understand the mechanism of high temperature  superconductivity and related phenomena in copper oxide  superconductors.  ***",
