 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is intended for faculty who are searching for new  pedagogical approaches and new uses of technology to teach calculus  to mathematically-at-risk students--students who are not prepared  to enter the traditional calculus sequence, but need to acquire  fundamental calculus concepts for use in other disciplines or  further study of mathematics.  The project is based on the Workshop  Calculus program, developed at Dickinson College with support from  the Fund for Improvement of Post Secondary Education (FIPSE) and  the National Science Foundation (NSF).  One-week Workshop Calculus  immersion seminars are being offered in the summers of 1996 and  1997, with twenty-four participants invited each summer.  The  primary purpose of the summer seminars is to provide participants  with the necessary background and support to adapt the Workshop  Calculus materials for use in their own environments, and to forge  the necessary liaisons to help them successfully implement their  projects.  To help accomplish this, participants will:  (1) learn  to use interactive teaching methods such as guided inquiry,  collaborative learning and experiential learning cycles--that is,  to use the workshop approach--to enhance student learning; (2) gain  experience using technology--including a computer algebra system,  the mathematical programming language ISETL, and  Microcomputer-Based-Laboratory tools--to help students understand  fundamental calculus concepts; and (3) customize Workshop Calculus  instructional materials for use at their home institutions and  design their own workshop-based courses; and (4) refine existing  assessment tools to analyze the impact of the workshop approach on  the attitudes and learning gains of students at their institutions.",
