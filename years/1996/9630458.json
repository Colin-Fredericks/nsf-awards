 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630458  PI:  Seeds  Neurons in the developing and regeneration peripheral nervous system (PNS) must accurately direct their long thin axonal process toward a specific target tissue.  The path these axons take toward their target is often blocked by other cells and extracellular matrix components.  Studies will examine the role of the extracellular plasminogen activator (PA) proteases in the developing and regenerating PNS.  Plasminogen activators are protein degrading enzymes that are secreted by migrating neural crest cells, and sensory neurons of the PNS.  These PAs bind with high affinity to a receptor on the surface of sensory neurons, where PA is thought to facilitate axonal growth and regeneration by cleaving cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions that block the path of  the growing neuron.  The dependency of sensory neuron axonal growth and extracellular matrix degradation on these PA proteases and their cell surface receptors will be assessed in 3-D cultures of extracellular matrix proteins using cells from mutant mice that lack the genes for these PA proteases and their receptors.  Another approach will determine the importance of these extracellular proteases in nerve regeneration for both pain and pressure sensitive neurons in these same PA-deficient mutant mice.  These studies will provide a greater under standing of the cellular mechanisms by which neuronal axons grow to their synaptic targets in both the developing and regeneration peripheral nervous system.",
