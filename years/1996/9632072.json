 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate inorganic thin films deposited on   chemically modified surfaces using pulsed laser vaporization.  The work   will be carried out under the direction of Dr. Eileen M. Spain at   Occidental College under this Research Planning Grant supported by the   Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program and the Office of Special   Projects in the Chemistry Division.  An organic layer will be placed on a   Au(111) surface by self-assembly of n-alkanethiols.  This will be   followed by depositing thin films of transition metal chalcogenides onto   the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) using pulsed laser vaporization in a   vacuum system which  will be locally constructed.  After transfer to   ambient conditions, the film morphology and structure will be imaged by   atomic force microscopy (AFM).  The long range goal of this research by   Dr. Spain and her undergraduate students is to understand the growth and   nucleation of inorganic thin films on chemically modified substrates.  Thin film technology involving layered structures is of the utmost   importance to the microelectronics, adhesive, and lubricant industries.    The properties of the interface between these film layers are critical to   performance.  The focus of this work is to develop an understanding of   the interface between an inorganic film deposited on top of an organic   film anchored to a metal.  Results from these studies will advance our   understanding of the structure of these interfaces and could lead to the   manufacture of new layered materials.",
