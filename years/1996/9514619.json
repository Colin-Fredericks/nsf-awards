 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514619  Clark    Learning and synaptic plasticity -- the modification of  communication between nerve cells -- play a central role in  a wide variety of cognitive and neuronal processes.  Because  a single neuron can make synaptic contacts with thousands of  other neurons, a fundamental question is whether increases  in synaptic strength are necessarily expressed cell-wide at  all connections of a given neuron, or can instead be synapse-  specific and so occur at only selected connections of the  cell.  To investigate synapse-specific facilitation, this  research program utilizes a favorable simple model system,  and focuses on cells known to exhibit learning-related  increases in synaptic strength.  Studies will first  determine whether long-term (> 24 hr) as well-as short-term  increases in synaptic strength can be synapse-specific.  This is a critical issue, given that long-term facilitation  appears to depend on changes in gene expression.  The  neurotransmitter serotonin will be applied selectively onto  particular synapses in order to induce facilitation, and  intracellular electrophysiological recordings will be used  to test whether synaptic facilitation is greater at treated  synapses compared with other synapses of the same cell.  Second, studies will investigate underlying cellular  mechanisms.    These studies will provide new insights into the conceptual  and mechanistic relationships between short-term and long-  term memory, and illuminate key cellular and molecular steps  underlying learning-related neuronal change.",
