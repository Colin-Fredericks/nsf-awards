 "awd_abstract_narration": "Distributed-memory, massively-parallel multicomputers can  provide the high levels of performance required to solve the  Grand Challenge computational science problems.  Multicomputers offer significant advantages over shared-  memory multiprocessors in terms of cost and scalability.  Unfortunately, extracting all the computational power from  these machines requires users to write efficient software  for them, which is an extremely laborious and error-prone  process.  The distribution of data across processors is of critical  importance to the efficiency of the parallel program in a  distributed memory system. In this project  the problem of  automated data distribution in such machines is being  investigated. The approach is unique in that it is based on  sophisticated cost models of communication and computation  that are parameterized by architectural metrics empirically  measured for different target machines. Using the cost  estimates, data distributions are selected to minimize the  overall execution time of the program by maximizing  parallelism (while maintaining load balance) and minimizing  the amount of communication overhead (by maximizing data  locality). Both static and dynamic distribution will be  supported in a unified framework to automatically select  data distributions which can dynamically change over the  course of a program's execution in order to provide scalable  parallel performance for large, complex applications. This  approach not only has a solid theoretical basis, but is  being integrated into a sophisticated compiler which can  actually generate code for a variable number of processors  supporting all block, cyclic, and block-cyclic data  distributions. The compilation techniques investigated in  this project will also be integrated with simultaneous  support for regular and irregular accesses in parallel  applications through a novel interval-based representation.  ***",
