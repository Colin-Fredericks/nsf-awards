 "awd_abstract_narration": "9554188  Austin  This project will determine how transactional writing, i.e., writing used to develop,  construct and express mathematical understanding, effects females' achievement in,  and attitude toward, their college and middle school mathematics classes.  The project  will target three different groups of student participants in the basic and intermediate  college algebra sequence, as well as in one group of participants in a three-year middle  school mathematics sequence.  College level achievement will be measured by the  Elementary Algebra Skills test; the Stanford Achievement Test will measure  achievement on the middle school level.  Attitude toward math will be measured by  the Revised Mathematics Attitude Scale.    Teams of mathematics and English faculty investigators, and their female students,  from a large, urban two-year college and participating middle schools from a large,  urban public school system will create an academic community through the use of the  college's electronic bulletin board. The project will intervene at the two critical points  that hinder girls staying with and succeeding at mathematics and hence, women  successfully pursing mathematics-based careers and reaching higher income levels:  lack of achievement and poor attitude. Transactional writing can be an instrument in  the construction of knowledge and the reshaping of beliefs.    Writing about math helps students more easily learn mathematical concepts.  Students  from middle schools and a community college will use a technique called transactional  writing to make them active learners. This, along with mentoring and career  counseling, will help them become more interesting in math and science careers.  ***",
