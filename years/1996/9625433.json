 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625433  Gin  This CAREER grant details the research and educational plans  of the Principal Investigator:  A research program dedicated  to the synthesis of new polymeric materials is described, as  well as several new approaches to graduate and undergraduate  education.  Aside from chemical structure, one of the most  important factors in realizing the intrinsic properties of  materials is extended order on the small scale.  Order on  the molecular level such as crystallinity permits  cooperative interactions between molecules in the material  for improved properties on the macroscopic level.  However,  in materials science, varying degrees of order are obtained  in synthetic polymers and composites typically via post-  synthesis processing (i.e., stretch-aligning).  As materials  chemists, one of the issues that  we would like to address  is whether we can control or induce bulk order in materials  through the structural design of the constituent molecules,  instead of through post-synthesis processing.  Specifically,  we are interested in exploring the use of  self-organizing  monomers based on liquid crystals as highly organized media  for the construction of a variety of sophisticated polymeric  materials.  We applying this approach to two areas of  materials research:  (1) The synthesis of new piezoelectric  polymers in which order and bulk symmetry can be controlled  on the molecular scale.  (2) The synthesis of highly  organized polymeric composites in which nanometer-scale  geometry can be predetermined through liquid-crystalline  matrix monomers.  %%%  Several ideas for the improvement of chemical education at  both the undergraduate and graduate levels are also  proposed.  Among these ideas is a modular approach to  undergraduate chemical education, where students will be  able to pick the topics they are interested in learning  about, in any order they desire.  This would be modeled  after special- topics lectures in the Modular Chem  Consortium (MC2), and NSF sponsored modular teac hing program  aimed toward developing and evaluating a modular approach to  teaching chemistry in the first two years of the  undergraduate curriculum.  ***",
