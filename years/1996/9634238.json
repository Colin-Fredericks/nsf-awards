Led by Jean H. Futrell, a team of scientists from the University of Delaware, Johns Hopkins University, the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and DuPont Central Research and Development will provide a new research and training program in analytical chemistry focusing on both fundamental research in mass spectrometry and applications to industrial problems.  The educational program features shared mentorship responsibilities in research and training across the four sites, along with a combination of new courses, professional training experiences, and structured internship rotations.  The proposed program differs from the standard model of graduate education in that the faculty team for the proposal will be jointly responsible for the programs of study recommended to individual Ph. D. committees.  Students will be required to demonstrate mastery of all modern tools for analytical problem solving in addition to in-depth research in a selected area of mass spectrometry.  Thesis research will explicitly include an industrial applications component in addition to traditional emphasis on fundamental discovery research.      This university/industry collaboration tests a new paradigm in graduate and post-graduate education of analytical chemists with the objective of preparing them for leadership roles in industrial research.  Scientists from three universities and a major industrial research laboratory partner to offer an educational program spanning all aspects of modern mass spectrometry.",
