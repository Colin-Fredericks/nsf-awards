 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is to identify the fundamental modes of   reactivity of transition metal complex containing oxo and imido   functions.  Detailed kinetic analyses of stoichiometric osmylation   reactions will be performed, augmented by electrochemical studies.  In   another set of experiments involving osmium -catalyzed dihydroxylation ,   X-ray crystallography and microcalorimetry will be used to provide   evidence about complexation between alkaloid ligands and olefinic   substrates.   Finally, the catalytic method for the aminohydroxylation of   alkenes via an osmium (VIII) species will be optimized. With this award,   the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. K. Barry   Sharpless of the Department of Chemistry at the Scripps Clinic and   Research Foundation.  Professor Sharpless will focus his work on   elucidating the fundamental mechanism of reactivity of transition metals   complexes containing metal-heteroatom multiple bonds.  A substantial   amount of the effort will focus on the reaction of osmium tetroxide with   alkenes in the presence of coordinating tertiary amines.  This reaction   has achieved prominence as a method for the introduction of stereogenic   centers into organic molecules.  Yet very little is actually known about   how this process occurs..",
