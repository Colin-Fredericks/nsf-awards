 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9634565  Peter A. Cholak      Cholak's main interest is in the interaction between various mathematical  structures and different measures of computability.  One such important  mathematical structure is that of the computably enumerable sets -- those  sets which can be enumerated by a Turing machine, with the relation of set  inclusion. Cholak's project aims at  understanding the relationships between  the definable sets, the various dynamic properties of these sets, and  the automorphisms of this structure.  For example, Cholak wishes to  determine the complexity (in terms of the above measures) of the question  whether two computably enumerable sets are in the same orbit.  This  could help one show that certain jump classes are invariant within this  structure.  Another part of the project is to explore whether every partition  of pairs has a non-high homogeneous set.  Such a result would improve our  understanding of the proof-theoretic strength of Ramsey's Theorem for pairs  and of Weak Konig's Lemma.    Cholak works in computability theory, an area of mathematical logic.  Cholak's main interest is in the interaction between various mathematical  structures and different measures of computability.  For example, the most  generally used model of computability is that of the Turing machine -- more  or less an ideal computer running without any memory or time bounds.  Cholak's research concerns the sets which can be listed using a Turing  machine, with the hope of further understanding the relationships between  sets which can be defined by formulas. Additionally, his research concerns  various dynamic properties of these sets -- how fast or slow their enumeration is,  and their information content.",
