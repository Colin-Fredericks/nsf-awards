 "awd_abstract_narration": "John Dahler is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his theoretical statistical   mechanical research on suspensions, polymers, and chemically reactive and   non-uniform fluids.  Four specific areas of research are being pursued:   1) Statistical mechanical studies of non-uniform systems that seek to   extend a new theory of non-uniform but static thermodynamic field   variables to incorporate fluxes and rates of relaxation and reaction in   terms of well-defined correlation integrals of microdynamic variables; 2)   An extension of a theory of colloidal dispersions and applications to   studies of frequency-dependent viscoelastic moduli and of sedimentation   and light scattering; 3) Studies involving a theory of chemically   reactive fluids to examine density fluctuations caused by size changes of   the species involved in reactions and the effects of chemical reaction on   collective modes of the fluid such as those associated with ordinary and   fast sound; and 4) Studies of the equilibrium properties of ideal polymer   chains to incorporate the effects of excluded volume interactions.  A number of commercially important products are derived from colloidal   dispersions and solutions of polymers.  Dahler's research is focused on a   molecular level understanding of the physical properties of such complex   fluid systems.  A deeper understanding of these systems may lead to   improved materials properties and new commercial applications.",
