This will be the fourteenth such meeting and will be held at Western Washington University from August 16-22, 1996.  Macromolecular crystallography is concerned with the accurate determination of the 3-dimensional structure of biological macromolecules.  This is important for a better understanding of biological function at the molecular level, which in turn leads to advances in medicine through a better understanding of the cause of disease and the design of new drugs to combat medical problems.  The School will be limited to 150 scientists and students who will receive lectures and hands-on teaching in the computational aspects of macromolecular crystallography.  This School is considered especially timely since computing and communication technology in general, and computing techniques in macromolecular structure solution and interpretation in particular, are advancing at a rapid rate.  A total of $5,000 is sought  towards supporting the School.  The overall cost of the School is estimated at $93,000  ***",
