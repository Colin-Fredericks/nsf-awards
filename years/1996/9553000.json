 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation and the Annenberg/Corporation for  Public Broadcasting, a private foundation, are cooperating on an  initiative to support national and international faculty networks  that can help individual faculty across the country to rethink  their own courses.  The curriculum in mathematics and sciences has  changed to incorporate student use of technology, and must change  more.  Professionals increasingly use computers, video and/or  telecommunications as tools of analysis, design, construction, and  research.  Students who do not learn the associated new skills of  thought are at a disadvantage.  In many fields, pioneering faculty  have made substantial progress in rethinking courses of study.   However, the work of these pioneers is often unknown, even to one  another.  Most faculty, even at institutions with the needed  equipment and logistical support, do not know what the leaders of  their discipline have accomplished.  In this initiative, project  teams will gather useful information about how selected courses of  study are already being improved at widely scattered institutions;  analyze that information; and widely share their findings through  data bases, on-line seminars, workshops, print materials, and  other media.  Heavy use of the Internet will be necessary in order  to reach large numbers of faculty.",
