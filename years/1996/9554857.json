 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work proposes a four course sequence during the first  two years of the engineering curriculum to simulate the  concepts of vertical integration.  This sequence will be  implemented within existing curricula and is thus cost  effective and not resource constrained.  The goals and  objectives of this work are to provide an alternative  procedure for vertical integration of material that works  within current frameworks, to increase student retention  between the first and second year of engineering curriculum,  to enhance the educational experience of engineering  students through the integration of mathematics, physics,  chemistry, and engineering science, to produce engineering  students that are creative, critical thinkers and mature  independent learners, and that are aware of the engineering  role in society as a whole.    The main contribution of this work will be the development  of an integration scheme that can be implemented within  existing curricula without taxing budgets or resources and  without political concerns.  The results of this project  will also be transferable to other schools and to science  and non-technical divisions as well.",
