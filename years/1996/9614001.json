Sessions examine the  commercialization of nanostructured materials for both near  and long term applications.  Topical areas of interest to  the meeting include synthesis and processing of  nanostructured materials, including the issues of high  reactivity, contamination and improved consolidation;  characterization of properties of nanostructured materials;  microstructural characterization and related property  correlations; thermodynamics and first-principle  calculations, including growth kinetics and atomistic  models; near term and long term applications of  nanostructured materials, including the issues of scale-up  production, near-net shape forming, processing optimization,  and cost-benefit analyses. The grant supports student  researchers to attend the meeting and present papers and  posters.  %%%  The conference explores new developments in the field of  nanocrystalline materials.  Unique properties have been  demonstrated in a broad range of these materials.  The  properties derive from their fine structural features, such  as a grain size or layer thickness, that is on a scale on  the order of 1 to 100 nanometers.  ***",
