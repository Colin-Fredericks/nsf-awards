 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mobile computing is emerging as an important new paradigm  which has the potential to reshape thinking about  distributed computing. Mobility has far-reaching  implications for what designers and users can assume about  communication patterns, resource availability, and  application behaviors. Components move from one location to  another, joining or leaving groups of other components in  their vicinity. New distributed algorithms are expected to  be required as the nature of applications shifts with the  emergence of this new kind of computing environment. Formal  methods have an important role to play in the midst of these  developments, both in terms of helping the research  community better understand fundamental issues germane to  mobile computing and in providing practical solutions to new  design problems. Ad-hoc wireless networks (AWNs) supporting  context-aware applications are studied in this research.  Such networks have practical signifcance for crisis  management, communication for small enterprises, and  organization of transient collaborations.  The somewhat  extreme characteristics of AWNs provide a challenging  testbed for studying mobile computing.    This research examines whether existing models of  concurrency can be extended to mobile computing and thus  provide appropriate means for the specification, design and  verification of mobile systems. It also considers related  support system software, such as communication protocols. To  accomplish this, the notion of location must play a more  central role in the treatment of concurrency, even in cases  where the ultimate goal is location-transparency. New forms  of modular interaction are investigated in this research. Of  particular interest are techniques to gain the advantages of  formal methods without the costs of developing formal  proofs. Design schemas and patterns with desirable  properties are verified once and reused in many  applications.  ***",
