 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    PI:  Borgia  PROPOSAL NUMBER:  9601560        Nonresoruce-based (NRB) mating systems are often associated  with exaggerated male display traits.  Studies of the  evolution of these traits have taken a prominent place in  behavioral and evolutionary biology.  Little is known,  however, about the genetics, dispersal and female searching  behavior in NRB mating systems.  Here we propose an  integrated study of  the genetics and behavior of the NRB  mating system of the satin bowerbird (Ptilonorhychus  violaceus).  We will identify patterns of dispersal and  factors affecting patterns of female visitation at bowers,  test sexual selection models, measure heritability of male  display traits and repeatabilities of female preferences for  males, and evaluate the role of genetic relatedness in  female choice, male learning of display elements and male  interactions.  We will use newly developed microsatellite  genetic markers to score relatedness and will determine  patterns of dispersal using blood samples from past and  present members of a natural population of resolution satin  bowerbirds one generation apart.  New camcorders will allow  high resolution monitoring of 40 bowers for accurate  identification of banded females as they visit display  courts and mate.  By radio-tracking females and monitoring a  primary food source, we will be able to determine if there  is an effect of resources on female choice of nest sites and  bowers that they visit.  This study will provide the most  comprehensive view of the process of mate selection in any  avian species with an NRB mating system.  We will test  current models of mate selection and our findings will aid  in the development of realistic new models for the evolution  of exaggerated male display.   This work should improve our  general understanding of the genetics of mate choice",
