Of these,  the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi complex form an  integrated system of membranes called the secretory pathway.  Proteins are targeted to the ER, modified, and are packaged  into membrane-bound vesicles that are themselves targeted to  the cis face of the multi-compartment Golgi complex.       The Golgi complex acts as a sorting center for proteins  as well as for lipids in the secretory pathway. The Golgi  complex contains porters that import sugar and sulfur  nucleotides into the lumen of the cisternae of the Golgi  compartments. Transferases within the Golgi complex catalyze  the assembly of these components into a diverse menagerie of  glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycolipids. Once  assembled, the glycoconjugates are sorted and packaged into  vesicular carriers for export to specific subcellular  destinations. The cisternae of the Golgi complex are  organized into stacks that are divided into a cis face (ER  proximal), medial, trans, and trans Golgi network. It is  presumed that vectorial transport between the cisternae  occurs through membrane bound vesicles.       While lipids and proteins flow through the Golgi  complex, the Golgi complex itself must maintain its  integrity. How this is achieved is poorly understood.  Budding of vesicles from the Golgi complex requires a small  guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding protein ADP-  ribosylation factor (ARF). ARF is posited to associate with  membranes and aid in the recruitment of vesicle coat  components. Two classes of vesicles coat, clathrin and COP  I, apparently require ARF for membrane binding. By analogy  to other small GTP-binding proteins, several effectors  should modulate ARF activity in vivo. These effectors for  ARF are as yet unknown.       The PI will use genetic techniques developed in  Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify effectors that interact  with ARF. In addition, this  technique may allow for the  discovery of genes whose products are required for the  proper functioning of the Golgi complex. Previous genetic  screens for mutants defective in secretion (sec) have  uncovered very few mutants effecting protein transport  through the yeast Golgi complex. The genetic screen for new  mutants and their characterization will be carried out as  part of an undergraduate laboratory exercise in genetics.  This course will be designed to allow the students to  experience the excitement of probing the unknown and of  discovering unknown genes, while learning techniques in  screening mutants and in testing for complementation.  %%%       Eukaryotic cells consist of functionally distinct  membrane-delimited compartments called organelles.
