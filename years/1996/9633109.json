 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reflection has been explored in an interpreted framework and  has tended to assume the availability of particular pieces  of the state of a program's interpretation, even the current  source code expression. Instead of programs, this research  emphasizes computations as the primary elements of  reflection. The research has two facets. The first is to  formalize and continue the theoretical development of a  system for computational reflection that is free from  interpreter-based constraints. This system supports the  introduction of multiple user-defined reflective properties  that can be designed independently and combined in arbitrary  fashion. Furthermore, new reflective properties can be  introduced after the programs in which they are to be used  have already been compiled. The second facet is to explore  the many uses of such a system. In addition to the simple,  but powerful, uses already explored, the system is expected  to be useful for rapid prototyping of language features,  collaborative software development, and static analysis of  programs for intense optimization.    Prior research in programming with first-class contexts has  investigated the meaning and use of static meta-level  contextual information. The word static here is intended to  refer to that information available in the text of a  program, without running it. The current research extends  the previous work by exploring the meaning and use of  dynamic meta-level contextual information, which is that  information available in the meta-level of a running  process. As in the previous work, this project emphasizes  modularity, allowing many different kinds of meta-level  knowledge to be utilized simultaneously.  ***",
