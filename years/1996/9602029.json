 "awd_abstract_narration": "9602029  Toran-Allerand      The gonadal steroid, estrogen, has multiple effects on the brain.   One of its well characterized actions is to regulate the activity  of the reproductive axis.  However, an additional action of perhaps  even greater consequence, is to influence the growth and  differentiation of neurons in the brain.  Recently published  studies by Dr. Toran-Allerand revealed that estrogens may be  intimately involved in modulating growth factor production in the  brain forming the basis for estrogen's growth modulating effects  but ultimately, estrogen also alters cognitive function.  Dr.  Toran-Allerand is continuing to investigate the interplay between  estrogen and growth factors by studying the signal transduction  pathways elicited by receptor stimulation.  In exciting preliminary  results, evidence for receptor cross-talk has been found.  These  studies are continuing and have been enhanced by investigations to  analyze key elements of the estrogen and growth factor systems,  including receptor coupling and protein kinases.  That estrogen  interacts in neurons with growth factors and their receptors  introduces an important new regulatory system with implications for  the development of the neuronal targets of estrogen.  Although sex  differences in circulating estrogen and androgen levels during  early life represent an important epigenetic influence and appear  to play a crucial role, it remains to be determined precisely how  exposure to circulating masculine and feminine gonadal steroid  hormone levels are translated into permanent differentiation of the  neural circuitry supporting sexually dimorphic behavioral patterns.   By stimulating the synthesis of proteins required for neuronal  differentiation, survival and maintenance of function, estrogen and  growth factors, acting perhaps in concert, as well as reciprocally,  may have important and intertwined developmental roles.  Thus,  mediation of estrogen action by interactions with locally  synthesized growth factors an d their receptors may represent a  universal mechanism by which the effects of hormones, such as  estrogen, may exert local control and exhibit both tissue and  developmental specificity's.  These studies essentially provide the  biological basis for gender differences in behavior among all  animal species, including man.",
