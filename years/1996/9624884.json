 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported  in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focusses on the  development of novel, useful, fluorescent labeling strategies  that will permit biomacromolecule analysis, especially for  proteins and peptides, using capillary electrophoresis (CE).   During the tenure of this four-year continuing grant, Professor  Beale and his students at the University of Alabama at Birmingham  will develop a highly sensitive peptide mapping protocol using CE  with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection, investigate  partial specific peptide cleavage schemes and pursue strategies  for putting a single fluorescent label at the n-terminus of a  protein without modifying the entire protein.  During this grant  period Professor Beale will expose undergraduates to research  opportunities and implement project-based laboratory experiences  in the senior level analytical course.  This course will be  tailored to students in forensic science, public health, pre-med  and chemistry.    The ability to characterize proteins by mapping peptide sequences  and to develop sensitive protein separation methods are important  objectives for a host of applications in biotechnology.  The  separations based on CE with LIF to be developed will be  sensitive and practical outcomes of this CAREER research project.   The enrichment of the undergraduate analytical curriculum and the  enhanced opportunities for undergraduates to participate in  frontier research projects are educational aspects of this CAREER  research project that will positively impact students at the  University of Alabama at Birmingham.",
