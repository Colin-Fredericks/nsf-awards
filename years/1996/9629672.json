 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the  Division of Chemistry and in the Atmospheric Chemistry Program of the Division  of Atmospheric Sciences, focusses on the development of an instrument and  methodology for real time chemical analysis of size-selected particles in the  0.5 - 100 nanometer diameter range.  The instrument to be developed couples an  ion trap with a reflecting-field time-of-flight mass spectrometer.  Professor  Murray V. Johnston and his students in the Department of Chemistry at the  University of Delaware will construct this instrument and apply it to problems  in nucleation, atmospheric chemistry, smog dynamics, combustion, and other  areas of small particle science.  There presently are no methods for doing chemical analyses on very small  particles that are sorted according to size.  This project, led by Professor  Murray V. Johnston and his research group at the University of Delaware,  focusses on building an instrument that couples an ion trap with a reflecting-  field time-of-flight mass spectrometer so that such analyses can be done.   This instrument will be used to solve problems in many areas of small particle  science including atmospheric chemistry, smog dynamics, nucleation, and  combustion.",
