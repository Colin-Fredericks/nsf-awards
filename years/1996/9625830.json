She will mail  it out  sometime tomorrow for your non-official approval, before we sign  it, etc.  Is a Text format OK for this, or would it be better to fax it to  you?    I am prepared to make a best effort attempt to meet the original  scope of  the work, given the reduced budget.    Here is the abstract that you requested:  *************    DMS-9625830: Global Continuation Methods in Nonlinear Elasticity    P.I.: T.J.Healey    Abstract.    We plan to carry out research in global nonlinear analysis of  partial  differential equations of nonlinear elasticity.  A major thrust  of the  proposed work will be focused on problems involving phase change  (weak  solutions and loss of ellipticity).  The analysis of such models  at a very  general level is fundamental to the understanding of martensitic  transformations and shape-memory effects, which are observed in  many  advanced engineering alloys.  Some interesting problems of  classical  nonlinear elasticity will also be considered.  The work has two  major  goals: (i) To obtain new qualitative results and detect new  phenomena - of  both mathematical and physical significance; (ii)  To obtain new  global-continuation (existence) results in problems of 2 and  3-dimensional  elasticity - including problems involving phase transformations.   In  classical problems (rubber elasticity), tools developed by Healey  and  co-workers in previous NSF-sponsored work will play an important  role.  For  phase-change problems, an entirely new approach based upon  higher-gradient  regularization, global continuation and singular limits is being  proposed.    Broadly speaking,the proposed work will provide important  mathematical  underpinnings to difficult nonlinear problems arising in  traditional  engineering fields like structural & mechanical engineering and  also in  more modern areas like materials scien ce. The work has the  potential to:  (i) provide new mathematical tools for the analysis of hard  problems of  engineering practice,leading ultimately to safer and more optimal  design of  structures; (ii) lead to a better understanding of the nonlinear  material  behavior of certain engineering alloys, with potential  applications to  manufacturing engineering and the design of non-passive or  \"smart\"  structures.      *********    Let me know if this is not acceptable - I'll be happy to make  changes.    Thanks,    Tim Healey",
