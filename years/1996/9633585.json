 "awd_abstract_narration": "HRD-9633585  Stevens    The Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR) requests funding in the  amount of $25,000 for travel grants for underrepresented minorities  to attend its Sixth National Conference to be held at North  Carolina Central University (NCCU), June 27,-29, 1996.  This is the  first time CUR's biennial conference has been held either at a  public institution or an historically Black institution.  This  affords an unprecedented opportunity both for the Black academic  community and the growing Hispanic community to network within the  undergraduate research community at the national level.  The theme  of the June 1996 Conference is:  Enriching Science through  Partnerships:  Academics, Industry, Government.\"  Targeted mailings  administered by both CUR's National Office and NC Chancellor Julius  Chambers have promoted the conference nationwide to science faculty  at historically Black and Hispanic institutions.  Funds are now  being sought to provide travel assistance to these targeted  groups.The objective of encouraging underrepresented minorities to  attend the conference is three-fold.  The first objective is to  provide the opportunity for underrepresented minority faculty and  administrators at primarily undergraduate institutions to learn  more about funding opportunities and successful undergraduate  research programs through networking and attending workshops at the  Conference.  The second objective is to bring the voice and  perspective of the underrepresented minority community into the  national dialogue on undergraduate research.  And the third  objective is to foster the involvement of underrepresented  minorities in the organization of the Council on Undergraduate  Research.",
