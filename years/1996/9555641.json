The Project also seeks evidence as to the effectiveness of particular teacher education practices in addressing particular problems of mathematics teacher education.  The analysis of data is from a cognitive and a social perspective and focuses on both the individual and the collective development of the teachers involved.    The Project employs a research methodology that incorporates whole-class constructivist teaching experiments and case studies of individual participants to study the development of the prospective and inservice teachers during and following a three-year instructional program.  Central to the MTD research effort is unique, extensive, and state-of- the-art teacher development program designed to promote in-depth development as a context for inquiry.",
