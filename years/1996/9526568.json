 "awd_abstract_narration": "Strother  9526568   Evidence from fossil spores indicates that land-dwelling plants probably originated during the Ordovician and diversified throughout the Silurian.  This transition in Earth history had profound consequences for all subsequently evolving terrestrial organisms, yet we really know very little about the origin and primary radiation of the land plants.  The proposal is designed to document and substantiate the presence of land plants throughout the Silurian of the central Appalachian Basin.  Such evidence consists fo sporomorphs (cryptospores and trilete spores), microscmpic plant fragments, and macroscopic plant thalli.  The proposed work involves field collection, sample extraction and preparation, microscopic examination, description, and comparison similar remains known from Europe and Canada.  Computer-based techniques in the analsis and description of fossil spores and plant remains will developed and applied for the first time to fossil spore studies.  Results of this research will provide the broader scientific community with basic facts about the origin and early evolution of terrestrial ecosystems.  Specialists will benefit from the systematics and documentation of the plant fossil record during a period of initial adaptive responses to the terrestrial habitat.",
