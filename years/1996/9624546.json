 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"STEP 2000\"-Student Teacher Equity Program 2000:  The Comprehensive  Partnership between the East Side High School District, ESUHSD, and  San Jose State University, SJSU, will build the capacity of ESUHSD  to ensure that all of its students will take high level math and  science courses.  By the year 2000, all minority students,  graduating from high school will have completed the Math and  Science components of the California A-F college entrance  requirements at a level of 40%, which is at parity with the average  for Santa Clara County.  The project will continue the reform begun  by the Equity 2000 project and build upon The enlarged based of  students in the ESUHSD who are completing Algebra by the 9th Grade  and who are now eligible to take the higher level college  preparatory math and science courses.  New math and science  curricula adopted in some schools to accomplish reform will be  achieved at all schools, including the acquisition of new resources  and the necessary teacher training.  Student supportive activities  in the form of Saturday Academies, Summer Institutes,  Career/Resource Centers, and Homework Assistance Centers will be  expanded during the project period to provide increased support for  math and science learning and to increase students' knowledge about  math, science, engineering and technology careers.    STEP 2000 will train all of the Districts 150 mathematics teachers  and all of the Districts 120 science teachers.  STEP 2000 will  affect all of the Districts' Grade 9-12 students, which will reach  24,000 during the Project period.  The underrepresented African  American, American Indian and Latino students, who presently  represent 46% of the students, will be especially affected.  At the  end of the project period, the number of them that will be eligible  to enter college and pursue math, science, engineering and  technology careers will have doubled from the start of the project.   STEP 2000 will complement and greatly help the other NSF funded  programs at  San Jose State University.  Specifically, the NSF  Alliance for Minority Participation program and the NSF  Collaboratives for Teacher Education Program will now have adequate  numbers of underrepresented math, science and engineering students  to recruit from.  ***",
