 "awd_abstract_narration": "This institution has a strong interdisciplinary undergraduate Cartography and Map Technology Program that is nationally recognized. The objective of this project is to obtain the necessary resources to pedagogically improve the cartography program by implementing an integrative approach of study involving several key cartography and geography courses. Students can benefit from this approach by learning the discipline holistically in completing major mapping and research projects that have a common theme. These IGIS projects would result primarily from multicourse exercises that are more meaningful and sophisticated in terms of method because they extend over a 2-year period. For this integrative approach to properly executed in the cartography program, the following equipment and software are being purchased:  15 Pentium PCs, 15 upgrades to l7` color monitors, and 2 additional Digital Video Plotter licenses.   Three key courses that require these resources to implement the integrative approach are Remote Sensing, Photogrammetry, and a revised course to be named Applied Digital Image and/or Photogrammetric Analysis. Project data generated primarily by image processing and softcopy photogrammetry can be utilized by these same students in ensuing cartography and geography courses. Because each major project links various key courses to IGIS exercises, this integrative approach enables students to gain insight into professional mapping practices and sophisticated research designs that require lengthy periods of time to complete.",
