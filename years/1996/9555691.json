 "awd_abstract_narration": "9555691  Gangolli    Building on a prior planning grant, this five-year project aims at systemic and lasting change in the way in which mathematics is taught in middle and high schools in six school districts in and around Seattle (Washington).   As one of the initial projects funded under the guidelines for Local Systemic Change through Teacher Enhancement in Mathematics, Grades 7-12, the project involves all 595 middle and high school teachers of mathematics in the six targeted districts.    The project's three major goals are:    1. To provide all middle and high school teachers with at least 132 hours of professional development designed to deepen their knowledge of the mathematics they teach, as well as to increase their understanding and appreciation of successful models of pedagogy, exemplary instructional materials, successful uses of technology, and various issues of assessment.    2. To set up a continuing culture of dialogue and discussion between mathematics educators at all levels (K-16) in the region, aimed at improving the learning environment in each school, with the mathematics teachers in each school acting as the team that spearheads change.    3. To inform parents and the community at large about the goals and methods of standards-based mathematics education, and help them to become effective partners in the enterprise of ensuring excellence in mathematics education.      This collaborative project is a partnership between the Department of Mathematics and the College of Education at the University of Washington, and the Bellevue, Lake Washington, Mercer Island, Northshore, Seattle, and Shoreline School Districts.  The 310 middle school teachers and 285 high school teachers participating in the project will engage in academic year workshops and discussion sessions, summer institutes, informal working sessions, optional workshops for special purposes (e.g., Internet training session), parent and community outreach meetings, etc.  A continuing electronic user group will be an i mportant strategic component of the project.      Estimated cost-sharing of $ 407,513 is derived from the participating school districts and from the University of Washington, who contribute in approximately equal proportions.",
