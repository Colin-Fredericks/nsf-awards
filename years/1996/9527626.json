 "awd_abstract_narration": "9527626  Wu  Recent moves to open up electric power transmission networks to  foster generation competition and customer choice have touched  off a debate over how the transmission system should be  restructured in order to meet the goal.  the opposing sides of  this debate are now commonly known as the bilateral model and the  poolco model.  Both models resort to conventional centralized  operation in dealing with the shared resources of an integrated  transmission network.  The conventional operation paradigm was  developed in a different era for electric utilities operated as  regulated monopolies.  A new operation paradigm is needed for a  restructured industry that encourages efficient competition and  at the same time maintains necessary coordination to guarantee a  high standard of reliability.  Coordination does not mean  centralization.  There are indeed two aspects of coordination,  namely, information structure and decision-making authority.  We  propose to examine the requirements for coordination in the new  operating paradigm for reliable (secure) and economic operation  of power systems along these two dimensions.  It is believed that  the decision mechanism regarding economics and reliability  (security) of system operation should be separated.  Economic  decision should be carried out by private multilateral trades  among generators and consumers.  The functions of reliability  should be coordinated through the power system operator with  proper information structure to guide generators and consumers to  make profitable trades that meet the secure transmission loading  limits.  The communications, computing and control infrastructure  necessary to support the proposed model will be investigated.     ***",
