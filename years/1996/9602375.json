 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multimedia Communications Technology     The convergence of computer, interactive television systems and telecommunications is creating a new employment market in multimedia communications technology. Multimedia refers to information that combines more than one medium. Every segment of the industry is growing quickly and has the potential for future growth. Networked multimedia communications will have a broad impact on business, education, and on communications in general Examples of networked multimedia communications include videotelephony and videoconferencing, real-time video on demand, interactive video and multimedia messaging, remote collaborative work, interactive information services and multimedia education and training.   Middlesex County College and the Carteret public schools will work, mver a two-year period, with representatives from the Siemens Rolm Corporation and York Telecom to develop and implement an articulated curriculum to prepare multimedia communications technicians for employment and continuing education. Building on an established, ABET-accredited electrical engineering technology program with a computer electronics option, the College will develop and implement a curriculum that provides a sound foundation in core and technical skills and knowledge, as well as the foundation interpersonal skills and knowledge that respond to industry needs. The overall goal of the project is to develop and implement a high school through associate degree program in Multimedia Communications Technology to satisfy the needs of business and industry for highly-skilled, well-educated technicians, and, at the same time, prepare graduates for further education. An existing articulation relationship with the New Jersey Institute of Technology will serve as a vehicle to extend Multimedia Communications Technology articulation through the baccalaureate degree.   The education of technicians, described as the employees who \"understand how the process operates in its entirety and are ready to  intervene if trouble arises,\" is a critical component in the revitalization of American business and industry. Where once an employee was expected to do a job without reference to what others were doing, now \"teamwork, communication skills, breadth of knowledge, initiative, versatility and leadership skills\" are basic requirements for employees at all levels.   Just as business and industry, to remain viable, have moved to a concentration on quality, so too must technician education restructure for quality. Key elements in the design of the curriculum structure will be the inclusion of methodologies and techniques that promote the development of team building and creative problem-solving skills. Collaborative learning, project-centered instructional activities and authentic assessment derived from the completion of real-life projects will form the curricular framework for the Multimedia Communications Technology program. The multimedia communications technician must have a background rooted in electronics and computer technology, with a strong foundation in mathematics, science, and written and oral communications, as well as the ability to participate as a team member in a quality-focused work environment. This background, coupled with a knowledge of graphic design, will prepare multimedia communications program graduates for careers in this new field.",
