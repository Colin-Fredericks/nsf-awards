Set-valued estimation  is a generalization/extension of the traditional optimal  point estimation.  It emphasizes the feasibility, rather  than optimality, of the solution to the estimation problem.  This research has ever increasing applications in various  fields of systems and manufacturing engineering research,  because it is insensitive to modeling errors, and therefore  can provide more reliable and robust solution to failure  detection problems.    The US and Chinese co-PIs on this project are well known  researchers in set-valued estimation, and bring  complementary expertise to the research.  Experimental work  will be carried out at the National Key Laboratory of  Manufacturing System Engineering to test the validity of the  techniques developed  during the project.  Both Huazhong University and Xian  Jiaotong University have received increasing funding from  various Chinese government agencies and industry in recent  years for work in the area of systems and manufacturing  engineering research.  This is an extension of work funded  under ECS 9496319.",
