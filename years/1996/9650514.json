 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid advances in social and behavioral science theories and methodologies pose substantial challenges to undergraduate students, particularly those interested in multidisciplinary fields combining elements from communication, economics, political science, and sociology. One major area of growth in these social sciences is in the use of small group and focus group studies and methodologies to increase understanding of complex and subtle decision-making and group interaction processes.   This project provides students with a state-of-the-art laboratory in which they can learn and develop research skills in small group and focus group behavioral observations and instruction. The project makes sophisticated video and audiographic recording and data processing equipment available to assist students in their hands-on experiences in conducting small group and focus group studies.   In addition, in combination with the targeted curriculum offered within each department, this cross-discipline Social and Behavioral Sciences Laboratory provides students with the flexibility to take more diverse opportunities for undergraduate research projects. This new equipment makes possible substantial cross-departmental teaching collaborations in the areas of communication, social interaction studies, and social and behavioral methodology and is ideal for a variety of honors and directed study programs to train undergraduates in modern and emerging research methods and techniques.",
