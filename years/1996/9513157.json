In contrast, the members of a small, diverse group of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms have the capacity to withstand the most acute of cell-water deficits.  How they do so remains an intriguing problem in biology.  One cyanobacterium, Nostoc Commune, has a marked capacity for desiccation tolerance and has been developed as a model for the anhydrobiotic prokaryotic cell.  In response to air-drying cells of N. commune synthesize water stress polypeptides (Wsp) that constitute around 70% of the total soluble cell protein and approximately 2% of the dry weight of a desiccated colony.  Wsp remain stable in cells stored for decades in the air-dried state.  Wsp are secreted and accumulate within a complex extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) that completely envelops the cell filaments.  Within the EPS the Wsp form multimeric complexes, through strong ionic interactions, with a secreted, water-soluble UV-A/B-absorbing pigment (UVP).\r\n\r\nThe principle objectives of this study are: 1) to isolate wsp from Nostoc, and to characterize the gene, its flanking regions and its control elements; 2) to understand how wsp transcription and Wsp synthesis are regulated by water stress; and 3) to crystallize Wsp.  The secretion of EPS and UVP by N. commune represent two strategies that the cells use to achieve protection during long-term desiccation.  The evidence found by Dr. Potts suggests that Wsp play a role in one or both of these strategies.  The knowledge of how N. commune overcomes acute cell-water deficit will provide an insight into the underlying mechanisms of desiccation tolerance in all organisms.\r\n",
