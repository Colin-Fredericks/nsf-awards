 "awd_abstract_narration": "9532021  Young    The proposed project will examine the continuous casting of steel, the   horizontal Ohno continuous casting of pure and cored fibers, and the   photocopolymerization of multiple monomer systems into optical fibers.    The general goals of the models are to determine the process sensitivity to   the operating conditions, describe the scientific phenomena of heat, solute,   and momentum transport within the system, and to elucidate the coupled   dynamics of these transport mechanisms.  A combination of asymptotic   techniques coupled with practical computational methods will be used to   simulate these systems.  Primary emphasis will be placed upon the   development of approximate analytical solutions to the systems of equations   governing these processing techniques.  In instances where this is not   practical, an asymptotic approach will be used to reduce the governing set   of equations to a simpler set of evolution equations.  Numerical simulation   of these equations will be conducted.    The proposed project will examine mathematical models of several material   and manufacturing processes.  In particular, the continuous casting of steel,   the horizontal Ohno continuous casting of pure and cored fibers, and the   photocopolymerization of multiple monomer systems into optical fibers will   be investigated.  The proposed solution methodologies enable one to   represent the general trends that material and system parameters have on the   system performance.  This approach also allows one to investigate a variety   of models in response to changing technologies, and can be modified to new   areas of application.  Further, the design of real-time controllers, real-time   optimization methods for complex, multi-stage, manufacturing processes,   and the desire for quick evaluation of a large number of alternative process   designs, require models which capture system trends and are not   computationally intensive.",
