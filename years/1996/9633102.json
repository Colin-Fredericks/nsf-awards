 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER), funded by the  Theory of Computing (TOC) Program, CCR, by the Theoretical Physics  Program, PHY and by the Informations Technologies Office, DARPA,  explores the application of the consistent history formulation of  quantum mechanics to some central problems in the new field of  quantum computation.  These applications include improving  algorithms for quantum computation (1) by carrying out  measurements at itermediate times, and (2) by error detection and  correction.  Quantum computation has recently attracted a lot of  attention, because Peter Shor showed that certain tasks, including  factoring large numbers, could be carried out in polynomial time  on a quantum computer, whereas no polynomial-time algorithm for  factoring on a ``classical'' computer is presently known.  Clearly, if it could be built, such a computer would have many  important applications in many areas of computational science,  including in communications and information processing.  Actually  constructing such a quantum computer represents a daunting task,  because of severe technical difficulties.  One of the goals of  this SGER project is to initiate a collaborative effort between  computer scientists, theoretical physicists, and experimental  physicists at Carnegie Mellon University, in order to explore the  applications of the consistent histories framework to determining  the feasibility of such a quantum computing device.  The  consistent histories approach make it possible to think about the  computational process in more realistic terms (where atoms,  photons, etc. are actually doing something over time) than is  possible in the usual ``textbook'' approach, that views the  quantum system as a ``great smokey dragon'' up until the point in  time at which a final measurement is made, and the wave function  of the system ``collapses'' into something which is physically  understandable.***",
