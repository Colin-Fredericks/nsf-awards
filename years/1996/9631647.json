 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is the development of an algorithm  for computing the regulator and the ideal class number of a  purely cubic congruence function field of unit rank 1.    Recently, the continued fraction baby step giant step algorithm  for finding the regulator of a real quadratic number field has  been adapted to work in real quadratic congruence function  fields.  This method has also been applied to work in real  quadratic congruence function fields.  This method has also been  applied to a variety of areas that are not immediately related to  the theory of algebraic congruence function fields, such as  elliptic curves and public-key cryptography.  An Euler product  technique for determining the class number of a real quadratic  number field has also been successfully modified to compute the  ideal class number of a real quadratic congruence function field.    In a complex cubic number field, Voronoi's continued fraction  algorithm for obtaining relative minima in cubic lattices is the  base for computing the regulator of the field.  A giant step  optimization has been developed for this method as well.  As in  the quadratic case, Dirichlet series and Euler products represent  a tool for finding the class number of the field, once the  regulator is known.  Considering the success of modifying number  field techniques to work in function fields in the degree 2  situation, a logical approach is the adaptation of the regulator  and class number algorithms in purely cubic number fields to the  corresponding function field setting, that is, a purely cubic  congruence function field of unit rank 1.  Such a field takes the  form K = k(x)(cube root of D) where k is a finite field whose  order is congruent to -1 modulo 3, x is a fixed element that is  transcendental over k, and D is a cube-free polynomial in k x   whose highest coefficient is a cube in k.    Questions to be addressed during the planning period of this  project include embedding a purely cubic unit rank one congruence  fu nction field K into the field of power series in 1/x over k in  order to obtain a theory of continued fractions in K, the  development of a reduction theory for ideals in K, and a first  design of a regulator algorithm, initially without giant steps.   The giant step version as well as the class number computation  will be the subject of research following the planning stage.",
