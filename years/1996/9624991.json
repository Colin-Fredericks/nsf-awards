The  main  research objective of this proposal is to  investigate  fundamental  aspects  of  mass  transport  and  fluid  mechanics,  involved  in endothelial cell dysfunction in steady and pulsatile  disturbed flow fields.    The  localization of atherosclerotic lesions in humans  coincides  with  the  presence of altered blood flows.  We hypothesize  that  the  complex  characteristics  of  these  disturbed  flows  (i.e.  variable  shear  forces,  flow  separation,  vorticity)  regulate  cellular  and  biochemical  events  close  to  the  vessel  wall,  promoting endothelial cell dysfunction and arterial wall lesions.  Endothelial  cell  cultures will be exposed  to  well  controlled  flows,  dynamically similar to those occurring in human  arterial  bifurcations   (preferred   sites  for   atherosclerotic   lesion  development).   Visualization  experiments  and  finite   element  simulations will be used to characterize the flow and to evaluate  fluid   forces   acting   on  the  cell  surface.    Flow-induced  alterations    in    endothelial   function,    including    cell  proliferation,    cell    migration,   monolayer    permeability,  cytoskeletal   fiber  reorganization,  expression   of   vascular  adhesion molecules, and distribution of leukocyte adhesion to the  endothelial   monolayer,  will  be  evaluated   using   in   situ  inrnunocytochemistry,   immunofluorescence,   time-lapse    video  microscopy   and   epifluorescence  microscopy.    The   physical  mechanisms  involved  in  the  modulation  of  endothelial   cell  function  will  be  identified and mathematical  models  will  be  constructed to describe the dynamics of endothelial function  and  local cell interactions in relation to the flow characteristics.    Cellular  Engineering  has developed into  a   highly  specialized  field  of research to which engineering students have very little  exposure  in  the  classroom and laboratory  courses.   The  main  educational  objective is to improve the exposure of  engineering  students  interested in biomechanics and biomaterials to Cellular  Engineering  as a discipline of study.  This will be accomplished  by  course  and  curriculum  development  aimed  to  provide  the  students  with the principles and tools of cellular  engineering,  in-class  discussion  of  the state  of  the  art,  and  hands-on  research experiences.  New courses in Cell Biomechanics  will  be  developed.    The   senior  level  Biomechanics  and   Biomedical  Engineering  Laboratory  courses  will  be  revised  to   include  cellular  aspects  and  state of the art cellular  mechanics  and  transport  experiments.   A  module  of  \"numerical  experiments\"  relevant  to cellular engineering will be developed for  students  to  work  in  a  simulation laboratory.  A course on experimental  cell  biomechanics  will  also  be  developed  and  undergraduate  research opportunities will be available to provide students with  hands-on exposure to research findings.  Finally, a journal  club  will  be organized in order to bring together individuals  across  campus  who  work  in  problems relevant to cellular  engineering  within different fields of expertise .    The   proposed  research  activities  will  contribute   to   the  identification  of  the  physical  mechanisms  involved  in  cell  pathobiology, in the rearchitecturing of the vessel wall surface,  and  in  the  cell  injury/dysfunction associated  with  arterial  diseases.   Better understanding of the effects of  physiological  flows   on   endothelial  cell  cultures  will   facilitate   the  development of hybrid vascular grafts (graft performance  appears  to   be   highly  dependent  on  the  complex  flow   environment  experienced  after  implantation).   The  developed  methods  and  procedures  may  prove   to be useful to the bioprocess  industry,  which  relies  on the ability of predicting cell behavior  and/or  manipulating  cell function to manufacture biochemical  products.  Finally,    the   evaluation   and   quantification    of    cell  function/dysfunction in controlled unsteady  disturbed  flows  (a  mechanical environment similar to that in which endothelial cells  reside  in vivo) will advance the state of the art in engineering  the cell environment for cell culture studies.    The  educational component of this project is expected to set  up  the basis for a comprehensive exposure to Cellular Engineering at  undergraduate  and  graduate levels, It will  prepare  biomedical  engineers   to   satisfy  the  increasing  need  of   the   modem  bioengineering,   biotechnology  and   medical   industries   for  individuals who can successfully apply the principles and methods  of engineering to problems in cell and molecular biology.  ***",
