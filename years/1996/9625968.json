 "awd_abstract_narration": "Watson  9626968  The investigator derives global convergence theorems and develops  practical numerical algorithms with high quality mathematical  software for probability-one homotopies in the areas of  constrained optimization, large sparse unstructured systems of  nonlinear equations, polynomial systems of equations, and various  disturbance rejection controls.  The emphasis is on useful  convergence theorems expressed in terms of conditions on the  original problem rather than conditions on the derived problem.   Important applications in control systems design and  multidisciplinary design optimization are used to guide the  theoretical investigations.  The mathematical software uses the  existing curve tracking kernels in HOMPACK, leveraging HOMPACK to  build application-specific shells.  Realistic models of physical phenomena are typically large and  nonlinear.  Solving the large nonlinear systems of equations  resulting from such models requires new algorithms, and some  recently developed homotopy algorithms have been successfully  applied to problems in circuit simulation, aircraft design  optimization, composite material design, control system  synthesis, and manufacturing mechanism design.  This work studies  the theoretical properties of these new homotopy algorithms, and  develops practical, high quality mathematical software  that provides a useful tool for engineers and scientists.",
