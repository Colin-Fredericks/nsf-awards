 "awd_abstract_narration": "The method of Least Squares has been employed successfully to solve problems in  many scientific disciplines, including signal processing.  The class of fast  Recursive Least Squares Algorithms was introduced in order to address certain  desirable performance traits, such as computational complexity, tracking, and  misadjustment.  Although these algorithms have evolved over many years and are  widely used in signal processing, a common approach addressing the issue of  algorithmic stability has been lacking.  This research provides an analysis that  fills this critical void in the research and development of these algorithms.   Descriptive definitions of stability are being examined which are consistent with  current and previous algorithmic analyses.  The effects of the forgetting factor  - the extent to which prior information is weighted - with respect to matrix  perturbation theory and the control and propagation of arithmetic roundoff errors  are being studied.  This research is also providing useful and insightful gains  in the important areas of filter misadjustment, filter tracking, the conditioning  of the auto-correlation matrix, and the usefulness of the filter output.    This research program joins the science of Numerical Analysis with the science  of Signal Processing, providing tools by which algorithms for signal processing  can be better designed and used, so that they will give more accurate results.",
