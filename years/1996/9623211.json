We have developed a very general   way of viewing reflexivity, and we have used it to discover   new results and easier ways of proving old ones.   We are   now developing techniques that make it possible to prove   that a subspace is reflexive or hyperreflexive by looking at   small \"pieces\" of it.   We hope to prove that a subspace with   a strictly separating vector and a strongly disjoint strictly   separating subspace must be hyperreflexive.  We are   studying approximation by characterizing closures of   certain classes of operators and by determining when   there are unique approximants.  Our approximation   results aid in our study of stable invariant subspaces   of operators.  We are working on a notion of ranked   operator spaces, which, combined with our work on   strong limits of similarities, should help determine the   closures of joint similarity orbits in finite-dimensional   spaces.        The theory of operators on Hilbert space is a part of   mathematics that generalizes to infinite dimensions the   basic ideas of linear algebra.  The growth of this subject   was stimulated by, and has applications to the study of   integral and differential equations, quantum mechanics   and control theory.  The general goal of operator theory   is to understand the structure of various classes and   collections of operators.  The principal investigator plans   to approach this goal by continuing his work on   approximation (i.e., which - and how closely - operators   can be approximated by ones that are well understood),   reflexivity and hyperreflexivity (operators determined by   their invariant subspaces), and developing simple algebraic   techniques to solve difficult analysis problems in operator   theory.",
