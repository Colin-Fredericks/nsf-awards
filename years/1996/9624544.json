 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9624544    The goal of this career-development project is to facilitate  uncertainty management in geoenvironmental engineering  through both research and educational activities.  Uncertainty is significant in geoenvironmental engineering,  and its effective management is necessary to maximize  benefits and minimize costs.    The specific research objectives are:  1. Develop and teach fundamental principles and practical  tools for managing uncertainty in geoenvironmental design.  2. Gain and disseminate knowledge about the performance  (both technical and economic) of remedial actions at  contaminated sites.  3. Create innovative educational units based on experiential  learning for teaching uncertainty management principles.  4. Provide unique educational and research opportunities for  undergraduate and graduate students, such as interactions  with private industry in internship programs and through  research collaboration. A key element of the project is  interaction between academia and industry; it is essential  in meeting each one of the stated objectives.    The project consists of integrated research and educational  activities, including the compilation of a data base of  performance information for remedial actions at contaminated  sites. Focus is placed on obtaining high quality, detailed  information for ten to fifteen sites, with selected sites  being used for case studies, both in research and in  teaching. Following the incorporation of an existing  groundwater flow and transport model into a simulation tool  to create hypothetical sites with complex, heterogeneous,  and transient subsurface conditions, this simulation tool is  used to study site investigation strategies, and as part of  an interactive software package for students to learn about  designing site investigation programs. Theoretical analyses  are conducted to develop practical guidelines and tools for  evaluating the extent of contamination and for predicting  design performance.    The education componen t includes, (1) the development of a  new graduate-level course and a continuing education course  to teach about uncertainty management in geoenvironmental  engineering, and (2) the incorporation into an undergraduate  course of a laboratory program that allows students to  experiment with the fundamentals of probability and  statistics through numerical simulation. Opportunities will  be created for student interaction with private industry and  other disciplines through internship programs, guest  lectures and research collaboration.    This career development project addresses an important  problem in geoenvironmental engineering, namely uncertainty  management. In addition, it will advance uncertainty  management in other engineering disciplines. The ultimate  product will be engineering students and practitioners who  have the capability to manage uncertainty effectively.  ***",
