 "awd_abstract_narration": "Daub  9631375  The goal of this work is to characterize genes and defense mechanisms responsible for cellular resistance to singlet oxygen generating photosensitizers.  Photosensitizers are light-activated compounds which, in the activated state, react with oxygen through electron or energy transfer reactions to produce active oxygen species.  One of the most reactive of the oxygen species is the activated singlet state of oxygen (singlet oxygen or 1O2). 1O2 is highly toxic, destroying critical cellular components such as lipids, proteins, and DNA, and often leading to cell death.  This project focuses on the photosensitizer cercosporin which is produced by members of the fungal genus Cercospora and plays an important role in the ability of these organisms to parasitize plants.  Cercospora is toxic to plants, fungi, bacteria, mice, and cultured human tumor cells.  Cerospora species. however, are resistant to it.  In order to isolate genes which are responsible for resistance to cercosporin, two types of cercosporin-sensitive Cercospora mutants were isolated.  Two cercosporin resistance genes were then isolated by complementing the mutants with DNA from a genomic library of the wild type strain.  The goal of this project is to characterize these genes and to determine their cellular function.  First, the gene sequence and deduced amino acid sequence will be used to identify homology with other known genes and gene products.  Second, the regulation of the genes will be investigated.  Third, the location of the gene products in cells will be determined by immunolabeling and electron microscopy.  Finally, the ability of the genes to impart cercosporin and photosensitizer resistance in normally sensitive organisms (Escherichia coli and Aspergillus flavus) will be determined.  If time permits, a separated-surface-sensitizer system will be used to define if the genes are able to protect against 1O2 itself or if they function by altering the photosensitizer molecule.  These studies will lead to the iden tification and characterization of genes and defense mechanisms that control cellular resistance to 1O2 -generating photosensitizers.  Although oxygen is necessary for life on our planet, slightly modified forms of oxygen exist which are highly toxic to living organisms.  Toxic forms of oxygen, usually referred to as \"active oxygen\", have been implicated in aging and in diseases of plants.  This research focuses on characterizing genes which protect organisms against toxic forms of  oxygen and understanding how they work.  This work will advance our understanding how to protect organisms against the damaging effects of active oxygen and thus have the potential to lead to improvements in plant health.",
