(New Zealand).  The purpose  of this project is to build a Geographic Information System (GIS)  describing the of the Dry Valleys in Antarctica as it existed in  1993-95.  To ascertain recent natural changes in this  environment, the Principal Investigators will add to the GIS  environmental information on a decadal over the preceding forty  years.  The study region, consisting of the Wright Valley,  Victoria Valley, and Taylor Valley, will be mapped at a scale of  1:50,000.  Inside the study area, two \"supersites\" will be  studied at a scale of 1:10,000.    To support the environmental inventory for 1993-95, the framework  will be significantly enhanced.  SPOT panchromatic and Landsat  Thematic Mapper will be rectified and merged for the entire study  region.  Topographic data at the 1:50,000, currently referenced  to an outdated astronomic datum, will be updated to the current  WGS84 satellite datum.  Digital orthophotographic maps at  1:50,000 for the entire region and 1:10,000 for the supersites,  will be produced.  Numerous aerial photographs of the regions  will be computerized.  Digital basemaps of glacier and hydrologic  features will be derived from satellite imagery for the 1:50,000  analysis and from digital orthophotographic maps for the 1:10,000  analysis.    The geological inventory will use a genetic systems approach to  compile surface and subsurface data on unconsolidated sediments,  bedrock, and geomorphic features.  In the glacial//hydrological  meltwater summary, various lake stream and glacier attributes  will be compiled to quantify glacial meltwater production and  transportation.    To describe changes in the Dry Valleys, environmental data will  be compiled into the GIS  for 1983-85, 1972-74 and 1957-59.  Satellite imagery for 1973-74 and 1983-85 will be rectified and  used to provide basemaps of glacier and hydrologic features.  Pertinent aerial photography acquired during the latter intervals  and during 1957-59 will be inventoried and used to supplement the  characterization of glacier and hydrologic features.  Pertinent  aerial photography acquired during the latter intervals and  during 1957-59 will be inventoried and used to supplement the  characterization of glacier and hyrdologic features.  A  comparison of four time periods will reveal physical rates of  change in the study area over the past forty years.    This research will provide a foundation for long-term  environmental management of the Dry Valleys and short-term  environmental impact assessments.  This research will result in  the digital availability of enhanced framework data including  topography, satellite imagery, and aerial photography.  It will  establish an Antarctic scientific data repository that will  increase the availability of Antarctic scientific data for  scientists and for improved management of science.  Finally, the  quantification of recent change in the Dry Valleys constitutes a  contribution the study of Antarctic climate change.",
