 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  proposal requests funds to dramatically increase the  sensitivity  of calorimeters used to study biological systems. The ultimate goals in  this   calorimetry   includes  the  study  of  the  thermodynamics   of  protein-protein  and protein-DNA interactions, the  thermodynamics  and  kinetics  of  drug  binding  (both proteins and  DNA),  drug  occupancy  studies,  and  studies  of  protein  folding.  Dr.  Hellman  has   used  semiconductor-based     micromachining    technology     to     develop  microcalorimeters  for  measuring  the  specific  heat  of  thin   film  materials  of interest to solid state physics. These devices have  been  successfully used to measure a wide variety of materials, all less than  5000  A thick and weighing under 10 ,u g; it is not an exaggeration  to  say  that  these measurements could not be made anywhere  else  in  the  world. There is however one requirement to all the measurements made to  date  using  these  microcalorimeters: measurements  must  be  made  in  vacuum. This requirement is due to the excess thermal conductance  from  the sample area to the surrounding environment which would occur if the  measurements  were  attempted in a gas or in  water  vapor.  Biological  systems  however cannot be held in vacuum; they are typically based  in  an  aqueous solution which would evaporate. A proposed modification  of  Dr.  Hellman's work will allow use in xenon saturated with water  vapor  and   will   produce  calorimeters  capable  of  much  more   sensitive  measurements  than  is  presently  possible.  Because  many  of   these  biological systems are only available in minute quantities,  this  work  would be of great significance for basic research on macromolecules not  accessible to present methods .",
