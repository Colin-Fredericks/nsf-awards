 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9634786  Chen         This grant provides funding for research on an innovative approach to rapid modeling of flexible manufacturing systems (FMS).  The objectives are: (1) to develop an effective analytical modeling technique capable of capturing the effect of material handling devices and the impact of component reliability and maintainability on overall system performance and (2) to enhance the understanding of interactions among the components of FMS via rapid approximation of critical system parameters not presently attainable in existing analytical models.         This research, if successful, will have a significant impact on the manufacturing science base.  Its unique features include (1) elimination of sophisticated simulation modeling and lengthy modeler training, (2) reduction of project implementation costs, and (3) reduction of project implementation lead time.  This powerful approach to modeling automated manufacturing systems also has a potential to enhance the functionality of the emerging manufacturing execution system being pursued by many major US Corporations.    ***",
