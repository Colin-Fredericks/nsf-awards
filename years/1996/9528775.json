 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Preparation of Management Plans for Antarctic Specially Managed  Areas    Annex V to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic  Treaty provides a new  framework for protection and management of  areas in the Antarctic with special environmental, scientific,  historic, aesthetic, or wilderness values.  Sites of Special  Scientific Interest (SSSI)  and Specially Protected Areas (SPAs), old  categories used by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties, are  replaced in Annex V by Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPA).  The Protocol also includes provisions for the development of a  detailed management plan to protect the values for which the area was  designated. While the Protocol has not yet been formally adopted by  the United States, there has been agreement to voluntarily implement  as many of its provisions as practicable.  One of those provisions is  that the country which proposes a site for designation as an ASPA  prepare a proposed management plan for the site for submission to the  Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.    Several SPAs and SSSI in the Ross Sea area were proposed by the United  States.  One, Linnaeus Terrace, Asgaard Range, Victoria Land, has had  a management plan prepared using the Protocol guidelines and is in the  submittal process.  Six others still need to be prepared.  One new  area is being proposed for protection and must also have a management  plan prepared for submission to the Treaty Meeting.    Management plans are needed for the following  sites:         Cape Hallett (SPA 7) - designated in Treaty recommendation IV-7       Cape Royds, Ross Island (SSSI 1) - designated in Treaty  recommendation VIII-4       Arrival Heights, Ross Island (SSSI 2) - designated in Treaty  recommendation VIII-4       Barwick Valley, Victoria Land (SSSI 3) - designated in Treaty  recommendation VIII-4       Cape Crozier, Ross Island (SSSI 4) - designated in Treaty  recommendation VIII-4       NW White Island (SSSI 18) - designated in Treaty recommend ation  XIII-8       Cape Washington (to be proposed for designation)    The content of the management plans will follow the general format  proscribed in Article 5, Annex V of the Protocol on Environmental  Protection.",
