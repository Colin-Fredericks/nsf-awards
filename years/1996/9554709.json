 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is holding summer workshops to introduce college  mathematics instructors to the reform of business calculus using  materials developed by the NSF Harvard Calculus Consortium.  The  workshops feature the use of graphing calculators and computers,  visits by professors from business, alternative pedagogies such as  group learning, and concrete lessons and strategies for  participants to take home.  While the reform of engineering  calculus for scientists and engineers is making considerable  progress, the traditional business calculus has not gotten the same  attention. A regional consortium of faculty teaching these  materials is being formed to help enhance the teaching of busiless  calculus throughout the area.  Follow-up activities are occurring  at sectional MAA meetings. Two-year college faculty from Truckee  Meadows Community College are involved with the teaching and  organizing of the workshops.",
