 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600146  Hagstrom    This project's primary focus is on the development, analysis and   implementation of new and more efficient numerical methods for simulating   wave propagation in the presence of multiple temporal and spatial scales.   This includes the construction of efficient  discretization methods and   accurate radiation conditions for solving linear hyperbolic systems, the   development of adaptive spectral methods for problems requiring highly   accurate solutions, and the analysis of splitting schemes for the efficient   integration of multiple time scales problems for partial differential   equations. Specific physical applications to be considered include acoustic   and electromagnetic wave propagation and the challenging problem of   simulating dynamic combustion phenomena making use of detailed models   of the physics. Basic analyses of the governing systems of nonlinear partial   differential equations will also be undertaken.    Multiple scales problems are difficult because the uniform resolution of the   smallest scales present would lead to a prohibitively large computational   problem, even for the fastest machines likely to be available in the coming   decades. They are also a common feature of scientifically and   technologically important phenomena in a number of distinct physical   settings. They arise sometimes from the need to solve problems on large   spatial domains or over long time periods, and other times from the   appearance of very localized solution features, such as sharp wavefronts. In   the latter case they are generally associated with singular perturbations of   the governing equations. Singular perturbations may be thought of as small   changes in the equations which can lead to large qualitative and quantitative   changes in the solutions. Such problems can also often be analyzed by non-  numerical asymptotic techniques and in this work asymptotic analysis is   used in a number of ways to guide and complement numerical    computations. The translation  of theoretical advances into useful tools, and   the consideration of more complicated and comprehensive mathematical   models is emphasized so as to maximize the impact of the research on other   science and engineering disciplines.",
