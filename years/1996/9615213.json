It will  activate a new collaboration between Roger Bilham of the  University of Colorado and Vinod Gaur/ John Paul of the Centre  for Mathematical Modeling, Indian Institute of Sciences,  Bangalore.  The researchers have developed a large field program  to determine: the shift in latitude of the Indian subcontinent,  the deformation in southern India, the rate of convergence of  India and Tibet, and they will conduct measurements in Nepal that  will provide a measurement interval for the Nepal survey.  Their  measurements will permit characterization of future regions of  enhanced seismic potential, establish the rate of growth of the  Himalaya, and the recurrence interval for great earthquakes  there.   Scope:  The investigators seek funds to support travel to India  and minor expenses to supplement field research costs.  This  research will determine the renewal time for earthquakes in India  and Nepal and identify regions of potentially enhanced seismic  risk in Peninsular India.  Since the destructive Latur earthquake  of 1993, there is great urgency to accomplish the goals of this  research.      ***",
