 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bishop  9630739    This is an award the objective of which is to determine the  feasibility of using regenerated activated carbon, catalyst-  impregnated activated carbon and Portland cement to solidify and  stabilize contaminated soils and hazardous wastes containing  potential environmental contaminants.  The regenerated carbon is  derived from processes to remove contaminants from water but  which has become unsuitable for reuse in the process from which  it has been derived.  The research involves determination of the  extent to which the solidification process results in the  immobilization of the contaminants.  The proposal leading to this  award was submitted under guidelines contained in NSF 95-111,  Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison With Industry.  The  industrial partners in conduct of this project are the Calgon  Corporation and E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Company.    Results of this project are expected to provide the engineering  design basis for use of spent activated carbon that can no longer  be sufficiently reactivated for reuse in the process from which  they were derived to adsorb and immobilize contaminants in  sludges and soil.  The use of spent activated carbon in this  process provides a potential use for a large quantities of spent  activated carbon that would otherwise be managed by incineration  or placement in secure repositories for hazardous substances.",
