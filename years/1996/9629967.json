 "awd_abstract_narration": "9629967  Domijan  The objective of the proposed \"NSF Conference on Unbundled Power  Quality Services in the Power Industry,\" is to provide an open  forum for faculty, students, researchers, utility executives,  managers and practicing engineers, regulators and business  professionals to discuss the alternatives of providing unbundled  power quality services to customers.  This forum will include a  comparison of cost to benefit of alternative plans and also, to  review the basic state of technology and engineering in this  area.  It is planned that this will be a recurring annual meeting  rotated between the University of Florida and the Arizona State  University.  The first conference is tentatively scheduled on  November 10-12, 1996.  The methods to be employed in development of the NSF conference  will be the creation of a workshop atmosphere that will be used  to identify the main research areas in unbundled power quality  services, such as: industrial needs, technology, measurement and  billing, competition, and standards.  The topics to be discussed in the proposed conference are  significant to the electric utility industry, which is currently  undergoing revolutionary changes in the way it is structured and  the services it provides.  Unbundled power quality services are  at the heart of these changes to the power industry.  ***",
