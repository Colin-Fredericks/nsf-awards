 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project introduces electronic measurement and manipulation of data through the construction and implementation of a measurement network in freshman chemistry laboratory programs for science and engineering majors. The result is a major revision of the laboratory curriculum that takes advantage of the capabilities of the network. The connectivity it provides facilitates cooperative learning activities. Learning groups of students function in a true team mode, sharing their efforts in experimental measurement and, most significantly, in the preliminary interpretation of data while still in the laboratory. Occasional multi-session projects can be undertaken, in which the members of learning groups study related aspects of a problem and combine their efforts to produce more meaningful results and conclusions. The students learn, through concrete examples, that today's chemists carry out measurements and data manipulation electronically, work cooperatively on extended projects as members of a team, and spend a great deal of time interpreting data.   A small prototype network system has been constructed and tested with students. This project will finalize the design of this prototype and construct and install it in the laboratories, concurrent with revision of the laboratory curriculum. Installation and implementation of the system in stages over a 1-year period allows direct comparison of student learning with and without the network. This can be assessed through common laboratory examinations. The clientele in the laboratory program are being carefully monitored and their attitudes and perceptions assessed through regular surveys.",
