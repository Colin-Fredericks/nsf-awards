Haber  National Bureau of Economic Research  SBR-9515222    The research will study how the relationships between political  economy, economic institutions, and growth evolved and were  manifested among the economies of the New World since settlement  by the Europeans.  Studies of modern expansion or economic growth  in western Europe and certain overseas offshoots have argued that  political democracy and economic growth tended to emerge  together.  This research will attempt to determine if this is  true in North and South America.  The economies of North and  South America followed very different paths of economic and  political development even though all enjoyed extraordinarily  favorable environments with respect to natural resources per  person, were established by the same small set of countries and  were peopled by individuals from the same economic classes of the  same populations.  Despite these similarities at the time of  settlement, they came to differ enormously with respect to the  degree of inequality in political power, human capital, and  wealth within their societies, the nature and structure of their  economic institutions, as well as their realization of growth.    Another reason why New World economies provide an attractive  natural laboratory for the study of democracy, institutions and  growth, is that they experienced a number of major alterations in  political regime, like the achievement of independence, with  associated changes (or failures to change) in economic  institutions.  This research will also examine in detail the  impacts of changes in institutions due to such events, with a  rigorous application of the comparative approach across  economies, to improve the understanding of the role of  institutions in economic growth.",
