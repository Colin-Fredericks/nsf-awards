 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623438  Bauman     The principal investigator will study elliptic and parabolic  systems  of partial differential equations (with physically realistic  initial   and boundary conditions) from physical models in two and three  space  dimensions.  In particular, the Ginzburg-Landau system describing  the current and magnetic field in a superconducting material  subject  to an external magnetic field will be studied.  The principal  investigator will also study nonlinear systems describing  hyperelastic  materials based on models developed by materials scientists.  %%%     The above problems concern realistic mathematical models for  the  behavior of materials which are of practical interest in  materials  engineering, materials science, mechanical engineering, and  physics.  Issues to be studied include how the modulus of the external  field  affects current and magnetic field in a superconducting material,  and  how defects and inhomogeneities in a material affect its  superconductivity.  Problems of this nature are important in applications such as in  the  use of superconducting materials for power transmission and the  use of  liquid crystals for displaying complex internal information.  ***",
