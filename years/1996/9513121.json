 "awd_abstract_narration": "9513121  Cohen    This award supports the participation of nine U.S.  scientists in a U.S.-Japan seminar on the Surface Dynamics  and Structures in Epitaxial Growth, to be held in Nagoya,  Japan, from March 24-27, 1997.  The co-organizers are  Professors Philip I. Cohen of the University of Minnesota  and Ayahiko Ichimiya of Nagoya University.  The meeting will  last four days and its proceedings will be published as a  regularly refereed, special issue of \"Surface Review and  Letters.\"  This meeting will further the increasing  interactions between U.S. and Japanese scientists  investigating epitaxy; in particular a special symposium of  the Japanese Physical Society has been scheduled immediately  following the seminar in the same city.  This U.S.-Japan  seminar should significantly enhance the interactions and  contacts between U.S. and Japanese scientists who are  developing theories of surface processes and who are using  new electron probes to characterize surfaces; the conference  will improve our understanding of these probes, and it will  help develop the technology for the growth of new, thin,  film materials.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills the  objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of  scientific knowledge through international collaboration.  ***",
