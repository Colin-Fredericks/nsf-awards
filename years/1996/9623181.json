 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623181  Sachdev  The primary objective in this grant is to undertake a  systematic theoretical study of the finite temperate  properties of quantum spin systems.  The project brings  together a wide variety of problems from apparently diverse  systems.  For example the cuprate compounds, also known as  high Tc superconductors, at low doping levels manifest  complicated interplay between antiferromagnetic fluctuations  and quenched disorder.  NMR in Quantum Hall effect systems  shows novel spin correlations.  Apart from these principal  examples, there are properties of rare earth intermetallics  where the magnetic ground states are critically influenced  by disorder or competing energy scales.  Finally there are  anisotropic materials where spin exchange and conduction  occur primarily along one direction.  All of this work will  be carried out in the framework of a quantum field theory,  derived from a continuum description of the spins.  %%%  The storm generated by the discovery of  high Tc  superconductivity led, rather early, to the solution of an  old problem, that of quantum antiferromagnets.  The PI was  responsible for some of the major developments and is now  proposing to extend that work to a variety of other  problems, specifically involving finite temperature effects.  The applications are in lightly doped compounds (which show  how magnetism is destroyed by doping) and their temperature  dependent properties.  ***",
