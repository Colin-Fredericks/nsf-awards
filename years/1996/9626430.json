 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626430  Eliashberg       This project will concentrate on several areas of symplectic and   contact geometry and topology in interaction with other areas of   mathematics.  In particular, there will be continuing study of   3-dimensional contact structures and the relationship between contact   geometry and the theory of codimension-1 foliations.  The theory of   confoliations initiated in joint work with W. P. Thurston should help   to clarify this relationship.  Another important part of the project   will be devoted to symplectic geometry of Stein manifolds, where one of   the main tools should be an analog of Morse-Smale theory for   plurisubharmonic functions on Stein manifolds.  Yet another focus   (joint with H. Hofer) will be contact homology theory, which should   deliver new invariants of contact manifolds in dimension 3 and higher.  Finally, a significant part of the project (joint with M. Gromov) will   involve the symplectization of Morse theory.  The results here should   help in understanding which part of stable Morse theory can be generalized   to the problems of Lagrangian intersections.       Symplectic geometry and topology have played an important role in        such different areas of mathematics as low-dimensional topology, Hamiltonian   dynamics, foliation theory, sub-Riemannian geometry, complex geometry and  the theory of functions of several complex variables.  Despite much recent    progress, many basic questions remain unanswered.  Moreover, the discovery   of new interactions with these other fields creates new demands for the   interior development of symplectic geometry and topology.  The research under  this project should answer some of the old problems of the field and   discover further applications.  ***",
