 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Laura Carlson-Radvansky and her collaborators will purchase a Fourward Optical Technologies dual Purkinje image eye tracker and supporting devices. The eye tracker operates by comparing two of the four reflections that are produced when light strikes the eye and through noting the position of them the tracker records changes in eye position. This instrument has high temporal precision and accurate spatial resolution. Response time of the eye tracker is 1 millisecond and spatial resolution is accurate to 1 minute of arc. Visual fields of greater than 20 degrees may be tracked. The investigators currently use a limbus reflectance eyelid eye tracker and the more accurate Purkinje tracker supplied under this grant will increase the range of experiments which can be performed.  Cognitive psychologists are concerned with what happens inside the head when humans think, remember, talk and look around at the world. Because these events are not directly observable, equipment and methods are needed that allow inferences to be made about the nature of the processes, representations and structures that govern mental life.  The research projects that will use the eye tracker are unified in their assumption that cognitive processes are dynamic and best understood by sampling behavior continuously across space and time, although the specific research questions are quite diverse, spanning the domains of visual perception, spatial cognition, memory and attention. The research will not only enable the investigation of important issues within each area, but may also enable the identification of commonalties across areas. The specific research questions address issues including the achievement of perceptual stability in visual perception, the coordination of multiple reference frames in spatial cognition and the spatial versus temporal nature of map learning.  The cognitive science program at the University of Notre Dame is relatively new and growing rapidly. It is attracting increasing numbers of undergraduate and graduate students and the acquisition of the dual Purkinje image eye tracker will further both undergraduate teaching and graduate teaching and research.",
