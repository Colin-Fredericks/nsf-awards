 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic  Chemistry Program will support the continuation of studies of transition   metal polymerization catalysts by Professor J.  Boncella of the   University of Florida.  Studies of transition metal complexes of   polydentate, polyanionic ligands will be undertaken with the following   objectives: 1) continued development of catalysts for olefin metathesis   polymerization and depolymerization with emphasis on the mechanism of   action of a recently developed tungsten-based catalyst of   N,N'-bis(trimethylsilyl)-o-phenylenediamide, 2) possible applications for  C-H bond activation reactions that are observed  with this tungsten   compound, 3) development of catalysts that will perform both metathesis   polymerization and Zeigler-Natta type polymerizations at the same metal   center, and 4) the synthesis of a new class of polyanionic ligands based   upon the pyrrolide ligand, including some that carry more charge than   ligating atoms.  This new class of ligands is expected to lead to the   synthesis of high oxidation state early transition metal complexes that   have unusually low coordination numbers and which may have enhanced   reactivity.  The properties of transition metal catalysts are critically dependent   upon the type and number of groups (ligands) that are attached to the   active metal center.  This project involves the synthesis and study of   several new catalysts.  Among objectives of this research are 1) the   development of new types of polymerization catalysts that are thermally   robust and allow for the polymerization of monomers that cannot currently   be polymerized because  of catalyst instability, and 2) the development of dual function   catalysts that can be used to co-polymerize two monomers that undergo   polymerization by different mechanisms.",
