 "awd_abstract_narration": "9560344  Lee         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will examine the feasibility of developing an innovative motion video-based Photogrammetry Data Acquisition and Processing System for special areas of highway design and maintenance.  To design and maintain transportation systems, three-dimensional data on specific areas are collected usually by means of aerial photography, manual surveys, and labor intensive data processing.  The current aerial photography methods cannot effectively collect data on areas that may not be seen readily from an aerial position.  These areas include bridges, rock face slopes, river banks, and tunnels.  The goal of this project is to develop a portable, easy-to-use, motion video based system that uses close-range terrestrial photogrammetry techniques to accurately model areas not covered by aerial methods.  In addition to a motion video camera, the hardware of the data acquisition system will consist of a Global Positioning System (GPS), encoders, and a laptop computer.  A novel feature of the method is that the system will be tailored to the accuracy desired for different applications through the use of a mathematical model.  The main research objectives focus on developing  methods to obtain accurate camera position and orientation data, and to automatically identify and correspond 2D points between video images.       The new system will offer significant labor and time savings in gathering photogrammetry, ground survey, and surface description data.  CamSys, Inc. has extensive experience in producing and marketing automated measurement equipment for acquiring photogrammetry data, and has distinct capabilities needed to develop the proposed new system.  Benefits of this new system will include innovative hardware-software methods to acquire and process video data to produce photogrammetry and surface description information for assessing the condition of bridges and tunnels, and modeling rock face slopes and river banks.  The system will  make the process of designing and maintaining transportation related systems more efficient and reliable.  Additional commercial applications exist in industries such as transportation, construction, architecture, education, and entertainment.",
