Preliminary work was `egun on a study of that subject in a few area colleges.  However, the investigator proposes to study the relationships that might be made from existing study sources such as the NELS:88 survey of 8th grade students in 1988 who have been followed up until they reached college in 1993.  The investigator also suggests that he will analyze data from the new study of international comparisons which has a sample of high school physics courses.",
