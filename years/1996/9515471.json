 "awd_abstract_narration": "9515471  Hawley      This award supports the participation of ten American  astronomers at a workshop entitled \"Accretion Phenomena and   Associated Outflows\" to be held at Port Douglas, Queensland,  Australia, July 15 through 19, 1996.  The American organizer is   Prof. John Hawley from the Astronomy Department of the University  of Virginia.  The Australian principal organizer is  Dr. Lilia Ferrario of the Astrophysical Theory Center of the  Australian National University.    The subject of the workshop is accretion disk systems.  These  systems are found in such diverse locations as protostellar  systems, binary systems containing black holes, white dwarfs or  neutron stars, and the centers of active galaxies.  The workshop  brings together researchers conducting observations and  theoretical calculations pertaining to basic physical mechanisms   involving these diverse systems.  The workshop provides the  Australian investigators the opportunity to interact with top  American and a few third country astrophysicists, while  acquainting the American participants with recent observational  and theoretical research in Australia.  It is anticipated that  considerable new collaborative investigations will emanate from  this workshop in the area of magnetohydrodynamical and fluid  dynamical codes which find application to modelling the physics  of accretion disks, jets and winds.    Astrophysics is one of the major fundamental sciences supported  by the Australian government.  The Australian support for the  workshop is primarily provided by the Australian Department of  Industry, Science and Technology (DIST).  The proceedings of the   workshop will be published by through the Astronomical Society of  the Pacific.",
