 "awd_abstract_narration": "North Central Collaboration for Advanced Engineering Technology Education in NDE/NDT    Increased requirements for improved reliability of machines and structures in a wide spectrum of industries have created a growing demand for educational and training opportunities in non-destructive evaluation and non-destructive testing (NDE/NDT).  NDT technician programs have developed in various parts of the country, largely in response to specific and urgent technical requirements of local industries.  The Center for Non-Destructive Evaluation at Iowa State University in collaboration with five community colleges, together with industrial partners, is developing materials and providing professional development for faculty to improve the education of technicians with specialization in NDE/NDT.  The primary activities include the development and dissemination of new curriculum materials for use in new and existing courses as well as the redevelopment of existing materials to increase their mathematics, science, and engineering content. Simulation of ultrasonic, radiographic and eddy current NDE techniques, previously developed at Iowa State University, are being transferred to personal computers for use in technician programs to allow students to develop a physical feel for how parameters of interest influence inspection results.  Community college faculty are being provided enhancement opportunities to enable them to better implement the new industrial and research developments in NDE.  Workshops provide professional development for two year college faculty in development of frameworks, assessment, and upgrading the mathematics, science and engineering.  Industrial partners are participating in the workshops and providing guidance to the project.",
