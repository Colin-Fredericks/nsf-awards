 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626589  Jacobson   The Palona, Orocopia and Rand Schists are Late Cretaceous-early Tertiary subduction zone rocks in southern California and southwestern most Arizona.  These rocks were emplaced beneath the mesozoic arc of western North America along the vicent-chocolate mountain thrust, according to one model, originating during low-angle, east-dipping subduction.  Thus the model implies top to the west sense of movement.  However, many studies have documented top to the east movement on many exposures of the fault, which due to subduction, would reverse subduction polarity and create several geometric problems for Loramide tectonics.  Recent work has indicated that many of these \"wrong way\" kinetic indicators may be due to later, normal faulting reactivation of  the thrust surface.  This project will focus on this possible reactivation and will attempt to date the movement.  Successful results will help finally resolve one of  the main controversies of  the Cretaceous tectonic geometry of  the southwest margin of North America, and illuminate the  younger extensional event.",
