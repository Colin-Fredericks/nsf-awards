 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632820  Dahleh         Precision machining is an important emerging technology with  manufacturing applications in diverse fields such as optics,  microelectronics, magnetic and optical recording as well as  sensors and actuators.  With trends in miniaturization, the need  to develop tools to shape materials as micrometer and nanometer  scales is expected to keep increasing. In view of this, we  propose to design, fabricate and use a machine tool which is  based on the concept of the atomic force microscope (AFM).  The  AFM is a recent invention which has so far been used to image  surfaces with atomic scale lateral and vertical resolution.  It  scans a sharp stylus probe across a sample surface while  maintaining a constant contact force between the probe tip and  the sample surface through a feedback control system.  We propose  to use the stylus probe as a cutting tool with the system having  the following features--(1) depths-of-cut will range from 1nm -  10um with surface finishes ranging from 0.1 nm -1 nm; (2) normal  and tangential forces on the tool will be simultaneously measured  with 10 nN to 1 uN resolution; (3) tool-workpiece relative motion  can be rotational and/or translational; (4) closed loop robust  control will maintain constant either the tool-sample force or  the tool-sample distance; (5) workpiece surface can be imaged  with spatial and vertical resolution in 1nm range; (6) workpiece  surface can be patterned to any desired shape - rotationally  symmetric or non-symmetric; (7) machining can be done with  lateral resolution in the 30 nm - 10 um range.  These features  will make the proposed design superior to existing precision  machining tools. The objectives of this project are two-fold --  (1) to develop an automated and versatile precision machining and  imaging tool; (2) to build a prototype device for the study and  validation of control methodologies, identification methods, and  the interface of control and the mechanics of machining at a  nano-scale.  ***",
