 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632166 Pearsall  This multidisciplinary research project addresses basic materials synthesis and processing research on the epitaxial deposition of a compound semiconductor mixed crystal system, GaAsN, having intrinsic strong immiscibility.  A novel approach based on conditions far from equilibrium involving atomic layer growth techniques demonstrated by the PIs in earlier research will be pursued; detailed structural, optical and electrical characterization will be an integral part of the project. The proposal addresses two controversial topics, the realization of GaAsN alloys, and the heteroepitaxial growth of such low defect density III-V alloy films on silicon substrates, and strives for greater understanding and experimental demonstration of progress in both areas in a phased approach. %%% The project combines fundamental materials chemistry/solid state physics and materials processing studies with advanced characterization tools and analysis methods to address forefront issues in a topical area of high scientific value and potential technological benefits.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to several aspects of advanced compound semiconductor materials and structures appropriate for device assessments.  The knowledge and understanding gained from this research project is expected to contribute in a general way to improving the performance of advanced microelectronic and photonic devices by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved materials, and materials processing routes.  An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***",
