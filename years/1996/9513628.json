Phagocytosis, a specialized form of receptor-mediated endocytosis, is the dominant host defense mechanism in vertebrates and in invertebrates as well as a feeding mechanism in most primitive organisms. The long term goals of this project are to understand how phagocytosis receptors are linked to the cytoskeleton in Dictyostelium discoideum in order to gain insights into the membrane-cytoskeletal interactions that occur during phagocytosis. A 150 kilodalton, plasma membrane glycoprotein, gp150, is a putative phagocytosis receptor in D. discoideum. When cells are grown in the presence of bacteria, gp150 is associated with detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton and is found in phagosome vesicles. In contrast, in axenically-grown cells, gp150 is largely detergent-soluble. To gain insights into the role of gp150 in phagocytosis, the gene that encode for gp150 will be cloned and sequenced and molecules that link gp150 to the cytoskeleton will be identified. Antibodies directed against gp150 will be generated and used to localize gp150 in situ in axenically- and bacterially-grown cells. Using established gene disruption techniques, the gene encoding gp150 will be disrupted to generate cell lines deficient in gp150. The phenotypes of the mutant cells will be characterized. The primary structure of gp150 will provide insights into putative functional domains that will guide future experiments that will be focused on the signaling mechanisms of endocytosis and of phagocytosis. To detect molecules that link gp150 to the cytoskeleton, antibodies against gp150 will be used in immunoprecipitation and in crosslinking studies with whole cells and with phagosomes isolated from cells fed latex beads. These studies will be conducted with axenically- and with bacterially-grown cells. These studies should provide insights into the role  of gp150 in phagocytosis as well as providing a contribution toward understanding the regulation of cytoskeletal-based activities such as cell motility, cell-cell adhesion and cell substrate adhesion, activities that are fundamental to tissue and organ development.  %%%  A major goal in cell biology is to understand how transmembrane signaling events trigger restructuring of the cytoskeleton which in turn effect cell movement as well as cell morphology. Phagocytosis, a specialized form of receptor-mediated endocytosis, acts as a host defense mechanism in vertebrates and in invertebrates as well as a feeding mechanism in most primitive organisms. Little is known about how receptors that are involved in phagocytosis are linked to the cytoskeleton. This project aims at identifying molecules that link plasma membrane receptors to the cytoskeleton.  ***",
