 "awd_abstract_narration": "One goal of this research is to study model selection in ARMA  models by utilizing parametric and non-parametric fits of the  spectral density function.  A measure of discrepancy is to be  developed which compares directly the parametric estimate in the  ARMA model with a kernel non-parametric estimator of the spectral  density,  as opposed to fitting the model and then looking at  spectrum estimates involving the residuals.  The particular  nonparametric estimator to be used is a Gasser-Muller   estimator which applies kernel weights to the periodogram and  utilizes a local bandwidth choice.  Optimal bandwidth choices for  this estimator will be addressed. Theoretical properties will  be obtained for the selection method, and performance of this  criteria will be assessed by comparisons with current methods as  well as extensive simulation studies.    Another goal is the collaboration with a colleague, Jeping He, in  the Bioengineering Department at Arizona State University.  He  has a significant amount of data on a project entitled:  \"Adaptation in Posture and Muscle Tone in Anticipation of  Perturbation\" which appears to be nonstationary time series data  but shows segments of stationarity.  We then have the opportunity  to use standard techniques in analyzing the segments including  those developed in the previous paragraph.  In addition we hope  to develop new techniques for analyzing similar nonstationary  data using, for example, the evolutionary spectrum.",
