 "awd_abstract_narration": "9616145  Leasure    Computers and software are often proposed as a solution for weakness in science  and mathematics education in K-12, but without a theoretical and experimental basis for the application of technology, funds may be mis-spent and education weakened. Unfortunately, the body of theoretical and experimental results is difficult to apprehend due to its cross-disciplinary nature, small publication base, rapidity of change, overburden of market-motivated and anecdotal results, and cost of experimentation.    This project gains access to the most relevant research to explore alternatives for the computer-based   realization of the situational mathematics process, a learning approach used to improve mathematics education among the predominantly Hispanic 6-12 grade students of South Texas. The use of funds will allow visitation to leading-edge research sites, visits by other leading researchers to the university, and funds to purchase equipment and software for technological  exploration. The use of project funds will be guided by an oversight committee made up of the leading researchers in mathematics education.  ***",
