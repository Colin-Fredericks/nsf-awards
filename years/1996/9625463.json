 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators study fundamental groups of algebraic varieties.  Particular attention is given to the fundamental groups of complements of discriminant loci.  These complements parametrize smooth hypersurfaces in projective space.  They are studied by means of the period mappings associated to the variation of Hodge structure of the hypersurfaces and of varieties naturally associated to the hypersurfaces.  The corresponding monodromy representations are also important in this study.  Zariski studied the case of zero-dimensional hypersurfaces (points on the projective line), where the fundamental group is the braid group of the sphere and the corresponding representations include the permutation and  Burau representations.  The investigators are making progress on corresponding questions for higher-dimensional hypersurfaces.  Particularly precise results are being obtained for curves and surfaces of low degree.   As one application, the investigators use this knowledge to construct  examples of projective and quasi-projective varieties with interesting fundamental groups.   This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, which is one of the oldest fields in mathematics as well as one of the most active at present.  Originally it treated the geometry of curves in the plane defined by polynomial equations.  Now it treats similar questions in many dimensions, uses techniques from many branches of mathematics and theoretical physics, and it turn it influences these branches, and other subjects.   This research is concerned with specific interactions between algebraic geometry and topology that have been developed not only  by mathematicians but also by physicists studying Feynman integrals.  The present research also concerns the study of braids.  Braids have been central to several branches of mathematics since their mathematical introduction by Emil Artin in 1925, and their influence continues to expand in mathematics and physics.",
