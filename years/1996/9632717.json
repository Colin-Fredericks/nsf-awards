 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632717  Stoltman  In order to extend the International Scientific Union's (ICSU)  Education in Global Change Project into Latin America, this  workshop has been proposed to bring together scientists from Latin  America to identify topics or sections of \"Science for  understanding tomorrow's world:  Global Change;\" (student  activities and teachers' guide for courses in biology, chemistry,  earth sciences, physics and general studies) that may be redesigned  into a Latin American context.  Using data and research reports  from their regions, participants of this workshop, two from each  Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) member  country, and IAI non-member countries (funded from other sources),  will develop local context extensions of activities in \"Global  Change.\"    The workshop will provide participants with necessary background  information about \"Global Change;\" will devote three days to  supplement units in Global Change for use by teaches/students of  Latin America; and will conclude with a day to finalize the  supplements to the Latin American version of \"Global Change.\"  This workshop will contribute to ICSU's Education in Global Change  Project by providing a final Spanish language version of \"Global  Change\" which will include a series of vignettes that will have  been developed during the workshop.  %%%  This workshop will provide an excellent opportunity for educators  in Latin America to convene in order to evaluate their global  change educational resources needs and to incorporate these needs  into a version of \"Global Change,\" specifically for Latin America.   Additionally, this workshop contributes to the IAI scientific goal  of increasing capacity building in the Americas.  This workshop is  being co-cponsored ICSU, Pro-Clim, the Organization for American  States (OAS), and the United States National Science Foundation  (NSF) on behalf of IAI.  The IAI is a U.S. initiative to stimulate  cooperative research on global change issues among the scientific   institutions of the Americas.  The National Science Foundation is  the U.S. Government agency designated by the White House to carry  out U.S. responsibilities within the IAI.  ***",
