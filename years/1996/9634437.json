 "awd_abstract_narration": "The successful federal HPCC program is in its last phase, establishing the basis for Teraflops scale computing systems and applications.  An important finding of this historical collaborative program is that many mission critical objectives of key Federal agencies require computing capability well beyond even that provided by the Teraflops systems of the near future.  Furthermore, the challenges to programming and resource management of the largest contemporary MPPs has revealed the need for alternative system structures and methodologies if very high performance computing is to become an important and wide spread enabler of industrial, commercial, government and science objectives.  In preparation to establishing future policy and planning directions for next generation research programs in advanced computing, a number of Federal agencies with compute critical requirements have joined to initiate a set of preliminary inquires in the form of workshops, panels, and studies.  This grant, made in cooperation with ARPA, DOE, DOD, and NASA, will provide funding for two workshops on Petaflop-scale computing.  The first workshop will focus on architectures, the second on system software issues.  Both will be held in California in summer 1996.",
