 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615772  Paerl    Productivity in estuaries is often controlled by nitrogen(N)  availability,even  though  there  is  a  vast  reservoir  of  gaseous N2 in the atmosphere. N2 fixation, the conversion of  atmospheric  N2 into cellular nitrogen, can  occur  at  high  rates in the plankton of freshwater ecosystems, due to dense  blooms of N2 fixing cyanobacteria. These blooms can be toxic  and  cause  water taste and odor problems. Such  blooms  are  scarce    in   marine   systems,   even   those   undergoing  eutrophication  (becoming more productive  as  a  result  of  increased   nutrient  inputs).  The  contrast  between   the  predominance  of N2 fixing organisms in freshwater  and  the  apparent  dearth  of N2 fixing organisms  in  estuaries  and  oceans,  provides  the  basis  for  the  proposed  research.  Estuaries  define  the  transition from  freshwater  to  the  marine   environment,   and  thus  provide   a   basis   for  investigating the factors that control N2 fixing  blooms  in  both  freshwater and marine environments. This objective  of  this  research  is  to  define how N2 fixing  organisms  are  distributed  spatially  and temporally  in  the  freshwater,  mesohaline and euhaline reaches of the Neuse River  estuary.  The  conceptual framework developed in this research project  will provide a new perspective for understanding N2 fixation  potentials in marine, estuarine and freshwater environments,  which will help to understand when and where nitrogen-fixing  blooms  are  likely to occur in response to  the  threat  of  cultural eutrophication. A particularly novel aspect of this  investigation  is  that experimental manipulations  will  be  used  to  determine  how salinity and nutrients  affect  the  distribution,  growth  and activity of  specific  N2  fixing  populations using a molecular biology approach. The  results  of  these  experiments will provide new information  on  the  regulation  of  productivity and  algal  bloom-formation  in  estuaries, freshwaters, and  the marine environment.",
