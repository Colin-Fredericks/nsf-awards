 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jiri Jonas is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and Computational   Chemistry Program to continue his research in experimental studies of the   dynamic structure of liquids using NMR and laser Raman spectroscopy.  The   major thrust of the research is to study liquids at high pressures and in   confined regions.  High resolution NMR of liquids under high pressures is   being used to separate the effects of density and temperature on   dynamical processes such as self-diffusion and shear viscosities.  Recent   work on the preparation of porous silica glasses by sol-gel processes   have led to studies of both NMR and Raman spectra of liquids confined in   glasses with well defined pore sizes from 10 A to 200 A.  The main   research directions to be explored include: 1) NMR studies of the   applicability of the hydrodynamic Stokes-Einstein and Debye equations at   the molecular level in liquids near their glass transition temperature;   2) NMR experiments dealing with confinement effects on angular momentum   behavior in liquids; 3) NMR study of conformational isomerization in   confined liquids; 4) Raman studies of confinement effects on vibrational   and reorientational relaxation in liquids; and 5) NMR study of the   pressure effects on hydrogen exchange in aqueous solutions of amides and   polyamides.  New information on liquids at the atomic and molecular level obtained   through NMR studies of liquids at high pressure will help in   understanding the function of lubricants.  The studies of liquids in   confined geometries has technological applications in many fields   including catalysis, chromatography, membrane separations, and liquid   permeability in geological formations.",
