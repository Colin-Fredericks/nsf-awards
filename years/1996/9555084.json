 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical foundations provide the basis for computer  science, yet many undergraduates obtain a superficial  understanding of these concepts due to the pencil and paper  environment in which these concepts are currently taught.  The main objective of this proposal is to provide an  environment for presenting and communicating abstract  computer science concepts in a more efficient, visual and  interactive manner. It is crucial that students understand  this material early on, at the sophomore or junior level, as  they will continue to build on this material in courses on  programming languages, algorithms, and compilers. For the  past five years, the PI  has been designing and developing  interactive and visual software tools (FLAP. LLparse,  LRparse) that allow students to experiment with concepts in  formal languages and automata, receiving immediate feedback.  The PI is currently using these tools in the classroom in an  interactive lecture format with a projector displaying the  computer screen. In this lecture style we solve problems  during class on the computer with input from students, and  answer questions by showing the answer. The PI  plans to  continue to shift the format of this class away from  lectures to an all lab (no lecture) format to provide the  maximum interaction. Each lab period will introduce a  concept and give students time to think and experiment with  this concept. The material to be developed includes  manuscripts for the lecture and lab presentation formats,  problem sets, and software tools. This material will be  disseminated through computer science education conferences  and journals, and news groups and web pages on the Internet.",
