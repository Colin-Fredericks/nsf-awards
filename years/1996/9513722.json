 "awd_abstract_narration": "9513722  Macher  Human alpha-l,3 fucosyltransferases (alpha-l,3FTs) are biologically important enzymes which catalyze the final step in the synthesis of adhesion molecules and important antigens. In spite of their important functions, very little biochemical information exists on these proteins beyond a predicted amino acid sequence and the identification of a limited set of naturally occurring mutants. The goal of the proposed research is to obtain information on the biochemistry of this class of enzymes, with the ultimate aim of identifying amino acids within these proteins that are involved in substrate binding and catalysis. This proposal focusses on the features of these proteins that lead to the strict acceptor specificity of each individual alpha-l,3FT. Preliminary results with FucT III and V demonstrate that truncated forms of these proteins, differing at 21/300 amino acids, maintain their unique substrate specificities. Domain swapping experiments have been done to obtain a better definition of which of the 21 amino acids are involved in defining the distinct specificity of these two enzymes. Additional domain swap and site-directed mutagenesis experiments are proposed to more precisely define the amino acids that are involved in acceptor substrate recognition.  An analysis of the disulfide bonding pattern of the FucTs will be done by mass spectrometric analysis. These studies will provide information on the spatial relationships of different portions of the coding regions of these enzymes. The information obtained from the combination of molecular biology, biochemistry and protein analysis will provide detailed information on this family of glycosyltransferases and this information will generate a model which can be utilized to design future studies of these important proteins. It is clear from studies of other enzymes (e.g., proteases) that the fundamental biochemical information obtained from the proposed experiments in this application is necessary to answer basic questions about al pha-l,3FTs and glycosyltransferases in general.  %%%  Proteins are one of the many important biological molecules that are produced by cells of all organisms. Some proteins are important as structural components, whereas others function as biological catalysts. In this project the objective is to obtain detailed information about a protein that is a member of a class of enzymes involved in the synthesis of complex carbohydrate molecules. All enzymes bind substrates, or reactants, and increase the rate of a chemical reaction. In addition, enzymes provide the information for the specificity of the chemical reaction. A major goal of scientific investigation is to understand how proteins bind specific compounds and catalyze reactions. This research will use biochemical and molecular biological approaches to investigate these aspects of a family of enzymes known as alpha-1,3 fucosyltransferases. The results of these studies will provide important, new information on these proteins. Since these proteins are members of a much larger group (i.e.approximately 100 proteins), the information obtained will add to the knowledge base for this entire family of enzymes.  ***",
