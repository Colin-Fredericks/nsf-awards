 "awd_abstract_narration": "The UCLA-CSUF-Community College Alliance (24 area community colleges that have worked together for more than 15 years) proposes a sweeping restructuring of the lower division chemistry curriculum and the auxiliary learning and assessment processes. In forming our new curriculum, we reject the positivist approach to science education in favor of a constructivist approach that emphasizes problem solving and exploratory learning.  We make this change in order to focus on the developing key skills, traits, and abilities of our students.  Our new curriculum, the Molecular Science Curriculum, cuts across departmental and disciplines to embrace all activities that involve the study of atoms and molecules.  In particular, environmental science, materials science, and molecular life science, have important positions in the lower-division chemistry curriculum.  The new curriculum reflects accurately current practice in research and the chemical industry where growth in occurring in these new fields.  Today information-technology-based learning enables a practical approach to discovery learning, which educational theorists have long favored.  Students can learn science by doing science.  In particular, we will produce problem-based modular learning units that define the molecular science curriculum; data sets organized for exploratory learning; prepackaged molecular, mathematical, and schematic models illustrating important principles and phenomena; and a client/server system that manages education.  Client/server technology enables individualized courses and frees students from rigid time constraints.  The learning units will be used immediately by several of the community colleges in technology programs, such as those for science technicians and hazardous materials technicians at Mount San Antonio CC.  New assessment vehicles including cumulative electronic portfolios of group and individual work provide new insight into student development and potential.    The project also addresses the preparation of  primary and secondary science teachers by involving them as active participants in the lower division courses of molecular science curriculum.  At both UCLA and CSUF, these students will gain experience with the modules, associated learning methods, and electronic delivery system.  These experiences should result in teachers with a practical perspective on science teaching as well as the ability to utilize current technology to direct learning activities.  The electronic delivery system will allow students at UCLA to work with the science education faculty at CSUF to obtain certification.  Since 1990 two high schools (Aliso Niguel and Crossroads) have become members of the Alliance.  These schools have the facilities to expose students, experienced teachers, and future teachers to both the content and learning methods of the molecular science curriculum.",
