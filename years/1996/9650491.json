 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering is purchasing equipment to develop an undergraduate process safety laboratory. Specifically, this project supports the purchase of:  a mini flash-point tester, a flammability testing apparatus, corrosion studies equipment, a reactive system screening tool, vent sizing software, and supporting accessories. These items can be used in laboratory experiments that expand upon and supplement the required process safety course. This process safety course and the laboratory are providing a model for developing similar courses and laboratories in other chemical engineering programs and therefore may contribute to what should be the ultimate goal of having process safety a required component of all chemical engineering curricula in the United States. The results can be disseminated through articles published in the SACHE newsletter and Chemical Engineering Education, both of which now enjoy a wide readership among Chemical Engineering faculty.",
