 "awd_abstract_narration": "9509562  Liu  The proposed project involves the development of an engineering  system of Artificial Upwelling and MIXing (AUMIX) which can draw  nutrient-rich deep ocean water (DOW) to the ocean surface as a  precursor to commercially-viable, open-ocean mariculture.  This  project will be accomplished in two phases.  The first phase,  presently being conducted with NSF support, involves the  development of a wave-driven artificial upwelling device which  brings nutrient-rich deep ocean water to the surface in a cost  effective manner.  Physical and mathematical models of the device  have been developed and tested.  Results of the Phase I research  indicated that a single device with a buoy of 4.0 m in diameter  with a tail pipe of 300 m in length and 1.2 m in diameter, can  generate an upwelling flow of 0.95 m3/sec in random Hawaiian  waves.    The second phase, as now proposed, will investigate the discharge  of the artificially upwelled DOW and its subsequent mixing in  open ocean.  The objective is to establish a nutrient-rich plume  that can support an open ocean mariculture.  To achieve this  objective, the mixing must be controlled such that the dilution  is small and the settling depth does not go below the euphotic  zone.  ***",
