 "awd_abstract_narration": "9560978  Lavid   This SBIR Phase I project offers a novel reductive photothermal process for environmentally safe destruction of chlorinated aromatic compounds such as Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs).  It utilizes UV light to photo-initiate hydrodechlorination of PCBs at moderate temperature, leading to their complete conversion into valuable hydrocarbons and HCl.  The process is conducted in a reducing atmosphere of hydrogen, providing the necessary radical chain-carriers and circumventing production of soot and toxic oxychlorinated species.  A large number of sites are contaminated with chlorinated hazardous wastes such as TCA, TCE, PCE, PCB, etc.  These compounds have been widely used and their presence entails severe environmental concerns.  All current remedial technologies are inadequate.  They suffer from high cost, incomplete destruction, emission of toxic products, and disposal/liability problems.  Consequently, there is a clear need for the proposed new process for the treatment of these compounds.  The main objective of Phase I is to experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of converting PCBs into environmentally benign products.  This objective will be met by a five-stage work plan. .Unique UV light sources will be employed and two proprietary options pursued, single-stage and two-stage processes.  A detailed kinetic model for a representative PCB will be developed, and computer predictions will provide guidance to the experimental effort.  Experiments with two representative PCBs will be performed in a bench-scale photo-thermal flow reactor.  Successful completion of Phase I will provide the technical foundation for a comprehensive Phase II, in which a prototype demonstration unit will be designed, constructed, and tested.   This novel reductive photothermal process will lead to a \"green\" technology for environmentally safe conversion of aromatic chlorohydrocarbons (e.g., PCBs).  It will provide a unique and cost-effective clean-up technology circumventing all the problems associ ated with current methods, such as high cost and emission of soot and other toxic products.  Consequently, it will be of great benefit to Federal and State governments and to the private sector in their remediation efforts.",
