 "awd_abstract_narration": "9634750  Daskin  This research involves the development of integrated models of production and distribution for perishable products.  Determining inventory levels and delivery schedules for products that deteriorate physically (such as fresh foods and certain blood products) or whose economic value decays rapidly (such as newspapers) present a number of problems for decision makers.  The investigators will develop and analyze models that address the timing and reliability of product distribution, location of product distribution centers, trade-offs between large production facilities where economies of scales may be gained and multiple plants that may be closer to customers, and routing product from distribution centers under time-window constraints.  These models will include uncertainty in both supply and demand of product.  The investigators will work closely with a large blood products supplier to ensure relevancy to industry needs.  In many industries, the economic value of goods is substantially reduced if their production and distribution is not timely and reliable.  Moreover, the production and distribution systems must be integrated in order to be most effective.  This research should lead to better tactical and operational models in highly competitive industries, and ultimately to better decisions regarding trade-offs between investments, operations, and customer service.",
