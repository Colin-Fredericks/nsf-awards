 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary purpose of this research is to investigate empirically the impact of recent federal reform initiatives legislated by Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act on the narrowing of the achievement gap between educationally at-risk students and their more advantaged peers.  These reform initiatives have encouraged schools to:  reconcile fragmentation between their Title I and regular services; foster effective school decision-making and organizational structure; develop effective parent involvement activities, and; promote stronger school-community partnerships.  This project makes use of the comprehensive, Congressionally mandated Prospects data files, which consist of standardized reading and math achievement scores for a nationally-representative sample of nearly 40,000 students, and detailed information regarding the students themselves, and their schools, classrooms, and families.  The investigators' analyses will generate national estimates of the extent and intensity of these reform activities, and will produce empirically-based paradigms for the improvement of federal Title I programs and the schools that serve at-risk students.  This information will guide stakeholders from all levels of the educational system to develop policies and activities that promote equitable educational outcomes.",
