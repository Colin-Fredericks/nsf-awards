Therefore, this system is   the starting point for any prediction about the microscopic properties of a   plasma.  The Vlasov-Poisson equations also play another very important   role. Recent research which involved the proposer demonstrated a close   relationship between the Vlasov-Poisson equations and the two dimensional   Euler equations in vorticity form.  The Vlasov-Poisson equations have a   simpler mathematical structure than the Euler equations which makes the   Vlasov-Poisson equations easier to analyze and solve numerically, and leads   to many explicit solutions.  Consequently, the Vlasov-Poisson equations   form an excellent system of model equations to study before considering   any open problems for the two dimensional Euler equations.  The proposer   will consider some fundamental problems for the Vlasov-Poisson equations   pertaining to the lack of uniqueness and singularity formation for weak   solutions and to the theory of statistical equilibrium solutions.  Many (but   not all) of these problems are related to unsolved problems for the Euler   equations.  The proposer will also study some fundamental open problems   for the Euler equations with vortex sheet initial data, using Vlasov-Poisson   results to motivate and guide this work.  Finally, the proposer will study   some interesting issues regarding the numerical solution of both the Vlasov-  Poisson and Euler equations.    Fluid dynamics is the study of continuous media like air and water.    Scientists formulate problems in this field by applying the fundamental laws   of physics such as the conservation of mass, momentum and energy.  For   most problems this procedure leads to sets of mathematical equations which   are too complicated to solve.  Based on physical  and/or mathematical   intuition the scientist then tries to find a simplified formulation of the   original problem  which is simple enough to solve and sufficiently   complicated to  describe the essential features of the original problem.  The   mixing process between layers of fluid which have different densities, like   air and water, or layers of fluid moving at different velocities is very   complicated and occurs in a wide variety of important applications in fields   including aerodynamics, meteorology and oceanography.  For example, the   flow of air over an airplane is very complicated.  In order to predict the   trailing wake behind an airplane, or the mixing process in a fluid, scientists   often use a simplified model of a fluid called a vortex sheet.  This is the   simplest realistic description of this and many other problems.    Unfortunately, despite the wide-spread use of vortex sheet models in many   problems in fluid dynamics, many mathematical properties of vortex sheets   remain poorly understood.  The goal of this proposal is to provide  answers   to many of the fundamental questions about the mathematical properties of   vortex sheets.  Successful completion of the proposed work will lead to an   increased understanding of the strengths and limitations when using vortex   sheets to model complicated flows.  The starting point for this work is the   simplest set of equations which describe a plasma, a fluid in which the   microscopic properties of charged particles are modeled.  Therefore, this   study should also lead to an increased understanding of the properties of a   plasma containing a concentrated beam of electrons.",
