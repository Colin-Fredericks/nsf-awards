 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this  project is to continue the development of  the computerized database of linguistic errors (slips of the  tongue) initiated in 1992. The interest in speech errors has  grown enormously among linguists, psychologists, and  neuropsychologists in their attempts to understand how linguistic  knowledge is represented in the mind, how it is accessed in  behavior, and the neurological basis for such representation and  processing. Many individual collections are now in existence  consisting of over 40,000 errors. Except for published examples,  there has been no way of sharing these data; this project hopes  to correct this problem by developing a database with the UCLA  Speech Error Corpus and the corpora collected by Merrill Garrett  (University of Arizona), Stefanie Shattuck-Hufnagle (MIT) and the  late W.H.N. Hotopf (of the London School of Economics). The  program which has been written and the errors entered to date  have already been made available to a number of other  investigators. When finally established, both the software and  the database (on CD-ROM or via ftp site) will be widely  distributed among all researchers interested in working with such  data . The program will be further updated to permit the  inclusion of crosslinguistic speech errors; entering of Spanish,  Italian, French, Thai, and Japanese errors has already begun. In  addition, the special kinds of coding needed to build a database  of errors and disordered speech of aphasic individuals following  focal brain damage will be explored.",
