 "awd_abstract_narration": "For the past three decades, the mainstream of linguistics  has focused its research agenda on the formal aspects of  language, primarily syntax. By contrast, the more recent  tradition of cognitive linguistics centers its research directly  within the semantic stratum of language in order to observe how  languages organize meaning and structure conception; and it  examines the more formal stratum of language for its role in  supporting these semantic functions.        The main goal of this project will be to outline the  fundamental conceptual structuring system of language. Language  has a formally distinct component - that of closed-class forms    whose specific role is to serve a structuring function: for  example, schematizing the spatial relations between entities and  the temporal relations between events. In this regard, language  is perhaps unique within the range of cognitive systems such as  perception, reasoning, and affect, so that mapping out the  conceptual structuring system of language may serve as a model  for comparable undertakings in the other cognitive systems.       In the book that will result from the research project, the  investigator's work in cognitive linguistics will be extended and  integrated. The analysis of language as a cognitive system will  be developed further, and it will be placed within a theoretical  matrix that includes the relation of language to other cognitive  systems.",
