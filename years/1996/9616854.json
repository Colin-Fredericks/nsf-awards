 "awd_abstract_narration": "9616854    The traditional advection-dispersion theory for miscible  contaminant  (solute) migration through soil in reality represents a  limiting case of  the more general coupled-flow theory in which the coupling  terms (e.g.  water flow due to chemico-osmosis) are assumed to be zero.  While this  assumption is generally acceptable in the case of miscible  contaminant  migration through relatively high permeability materials,  the accuracy of  this assumption in terms of the relatively low-permeability,  fine-grained  materials typical of pollutant barriers has not been  formally evaluated.    The goal of this study is to evaluate the significance of  chemico-osmosis  and electro-osmosis on the migration of miscible  contaminants through  engineered clay barriers used for waste containment and in  situ  remediation.  The following objectives will be addressed:    * coupled flow parameters (e.g. hydraulic, chemico-  osmotic, and  electro-osmotic conductivity; electrical conductance; and  osmotic  efficiency coefficient) for clay soils will be measured  under several  different test conditions (stress, compaction, solute  concentration and  type);    * parameters expected to dominate solute transport under  low-flow  conditions will be measured independently for the same  soils, solutes, and  test conditions;    * measured migration rates of the solutes through  laboratory soil columns  will be compared with predicted rates using analytical  models based on both  the coupled flow and the advective-diffusive modeling  approaches; and    * a finite difference model will be developed and used to  evaluate the  potential effect of volume change on solute mass flux for  both coupled flow  and the advective-diffusive modeling approaches.  ***",
