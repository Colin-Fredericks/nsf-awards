 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scott  9631093  Biophysical and biochemical methods will be employed to study the structure and assembly of protein and DNA components of the transcription pre-initiation complex of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus. The single archaeal transcription system exhibits more homology to the eucaryal than the bacterial transcription apparatus, suggesting that an ancestral archaeal system evolved into the three eucaryal transcription complexes that synthesize rRNA, mRNA, and tRNA, using RNA polymerase (RNAP)I, II, and III, respectively. The resulting understanding of the molecular topology and mechanism of archaeal basal transcription is expected to shed light on eucaryal transcription as well as providing evolutionary information related to the divergence of the three eucaryal systems. The P. furiosus transcription system was chosen for study because: (a) little is known about archaeal transcription and its regulation; (b) the archaeal system is expected to be less complex than the eucaryal descendants; (c) the transcription complex components and their interactions are expected to be more robust given their hyperthermophilic source.  In eucaryal basal transcription of protein-coding genes using RNAPII, the assembly of the PIC starts with recognition by the TATA-binding protein (TBP) of TATA-containing promoter sequences ca. 25 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Then, transcription factor (TF)IIB binds to the TBP/promoter complexes and recruits RNAPII and other transcription factors to the complex to initiate transcription. This proposal focuses on archaeal homologs of TBP and TFIIB. Structural data are available on the interaction of eucaryal TFIIB with TBP/promoter; they indicate that the ca. 200 residue C-terminal core of TFIIB binds to TBP and DNA sequences both up- and downstream of the TATA box, which interacts with TBP. No structural information is available on the disposition of the N-terminal ca 100 residues of eucaryal TFIIB . Our work has elucidated the NMR solut ion structure of a 50 residue N-terminal fragment of P. furiosus TFB (homologous to eucaryal TFIIB), which is shown to adopt a \"zinc ribbon\" structure very similar to that displayed by the C-terminal domain of human TFIIS, a transcription elongation factor. The DNA-binding ability of the C-terminal portion of TFIIB suggests that the N-terminal domain of TFIIB may interact with the DNA downstream of the TATA--box, perhaps near the transcription start site. Point mutations in the N-terminal domain of eucaryal TFIIB are known to affect the location of the transcription start site.  This unique structural information will be put to use in studies designed to probe the structure, interactions, and function of the N-terminal portion of TFIIB. NMR will be used to characterize structurally a larger (125 residue) N-terminal fragment of P. furiosus TFB, to provide the context to assemble a structural model for the full-length protein. NMR will also be used to solve the solution structure of the N-terminal fragment of human TFIIB for comparison with that of P. furiosus TFB. This is important since higher eucarya have putative (Cys, His, Cys, Cys) zinc binding residues compared to four Cys in archaea (and yeast). A sensitive method will be developed using tethered Fe(EDTA) as a local artificial nuclease to probe the region of DNA contacted by the N(and C-)terminal regions of P. furiosus TFB. A functional transcription assay will be developed using an established hybrid cell-free system from Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus transcription components. This and the nuclease-probe method will be used to study the effects of targeted mutations in the N-terminal domain of P. furiosus TFB. Of particular interest is the requirement of zinc binding for proper functioning of TF(II)B in transcription initiation.  Finally, several strategies will be used to identify other required components of the P. furiosus transcription apparatus, including the RNA polymerase. Ultimately, a functioning in vitro basal transcription  complex will allow the study of transcriptional regulation in P. furiosus.  %%%  Production of  proteins from the genes that encode them consists of transcription of the DNA (gene) to messenger RNA, then translation of the mRNA into protein.  A detailed picture of the proteins involved in transcription and the regulation of this process is expected to provide, for example, targets for therapy of genetic diseases.  The archaeal domain of life was discovered in the past decade as a separate group of microorganisms distinct from bacteria as well as from eukaryotes. The transcription system of archaea appears to be more closely related to that of eukaryotes, rather than that of bacteria.  This project will study the topology (arrangement of protein and nucleic acid components ) of the archaeal transcription complex to discover: (a) more details of the functioning of  the archaeal complex, about which little is known; (b) whether the archaeal transcription complex is unique in being able to produce all three types of RNA, (mRNA, rRNA, tRNA); and (c) how the transcription system of he hyperthermophilic marine archaeal Pyrococcus furiosus can carry out its function at the optimal growth temperature of 100 degreeC.  We will build on structural work already available on components of the eukaryotic transcription complex to study the arterial components.  Of particular interest is the possible interaction of the N-terminal domain of transcription factor IIB with promoter DNA near the transcription start site and several sets of experiments are targeted at elucidating  these interactions.  ***  ??",
