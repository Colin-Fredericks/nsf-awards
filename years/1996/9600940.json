 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600940  Budil  This project is directed towards characterizing the  structural features governing the primary light reaction in  photosynthetic organisms using novel high-field electron  magnetic resonance methods.  The excellent spectral  resolution at high field provides a new means of probing the  structure of the primary reactant radicals.  Orientation  selectivity at high frequency will be exploited to carry out  \"g-magnetophotoselection\" experiments that will relate  magnetic properties to the optical properties of the primary  reactants.  Where possible, single crystal studies will be  undertaken in order to correlate the magnetic tensors of the  reactants directly with the ground state structure of the  RC. Structural influences will also be investigated by a  novel \"electrostatic mapping\" approach in which nitroxide  spin labels are introduced at specific amino acid residues  of the protein using site-directed mutagenesis.  The  electric field sensitivity of high-frequency nitroxide  spectra will enable direct exploration of local  electrostatics at selected sites in the reaction center,  providing significant new information about the protein  microenvironment that guides the primary photochemistry. %%%  The broader research goal of this project is to develop new  magnetic resonance techniques for probing dynamic  macromolecular structures, with an immediate focus on the  structure and function of the photochemical reaction centers  in photosynthetic organisms.  High-frequency electron  magnetic resonance will be used to probe the microscopic  structure of the primary reactants and the surrounding  protein, as well as the photochemical reaction dynamics. The  educational goals of this program will integrate advanced  physical concepts, with an emphasis on magnetic resonance  methods, into training in molecular biology.  New  opportunities will be created for students to augment their  cooperative education experience at Northeastern University  by engaging directly in the development  of new biophysical  methodologies in collaboration with local entrepreneurial  companies.  ***",
