 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cornell School of Civil and Environmental Engineering is recognized as one of the top ten national programs in the training of environmental scientists and engineers. The orientation of study in the Environmental Engineering program is toward understanding the principles, phenomena, and engineering techniques that are applicable to the maintenance of environmental quality.  Research in the program focuses on pertinent biological, chemical, physical and engineering knowledge.  This scientific and engineering knowledge is used in conjunction with analytical, computational, and laboratory skills, in the planning, analysis and design of processes, facilities and systems that are essential to advancing environmental quality objectives.  Environmental Engineering research and training facilities are housed in Hollister Hall, which was constructed in the early 1950's. Existing conditions of laboratories in Hollister have become major impediments in the Department's research and training efforts. All fume hoods fail to meet current safety standards and none of the rooms have adequate ventilation, and are poorly designed.   As a part of its continuing commitment to research training in environmental engineering, Cornell University, with assistance from the National Science Foundation, will modernize a laboratory to house equipment and serve as a graduate research analytical facility.  The renovated facility will also be used as the site for a new undergraduate research training course.  In addition to resolving  utility, space, and fume hood inadequacies, the department will create an innovative research training facility that will serve as a national model for integration of faculty research with the training of students in research methods once renovations are completed.",
