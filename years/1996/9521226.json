 "awd_abstract_narration": "Szyld  This award will support collaborative research between Daniel Szyld of Temple University, and Rafael Bru, Polytechnic University of Valencia, Spain.  The proposed study will focus on the parallel solution of large systems of linear algebraic equations.  In particular, asynchronous iterative methods and preconditioned Krylov-type methods, for both singular and nonsingular systems, will be studied.  The primary benefit of the collaboration is the joining of complementary skills and compatible research views.  Professor Bru's work on the convergence of the product of nonnegative matrices is relevant to Szyld's work on analyzing the convergence of two-stage iterative methods and on asynchronous methods, and has already led to joint publications by the collaborators or their students.  The proposed research includes theoretical, algorithmic, and experimental elements.  It will explore convergence properties and implementation details of parallel block and asynchronous iterative methods.  Numerical experiments will be performed.",
