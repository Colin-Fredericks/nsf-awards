 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. George Richter-Addo, Department of Chemistry, University of Oklahoma,   is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program   of the Chemistry Division under a Faculty Early Career Development Award    for studies of nitrosyl- and nitroso-metalloporphyrins.  Nitric oxide is   an atmospheric pollutant and it plays an important role in some   biosynthetic pathways.  Organic nitroso compounds may play a role as   physiological mediators in reactions of nitric oxide.  Metalloporphyrin   complexes will be synthesized, and the chemical reactions and modes of   interaction with the metal centers will be investigated.  The education   plan is aimed at involving undergraduate students in research, designing   laboratory experiments involving metalloporphyrin synthesis, and   developing an undergraduate bioinorganic course.  The overall goal of this research is to examine the reactions of   synthetic analogues of biologically important molecules known as   metalloporphyrins.  These molecules, which consist of a metal ion   surrounded by a ring of nitrogen and carbon atoms, are ubiquitous in   biological systems and have been found to react with nitric oxide and its   derivatives.  Nitric oxide is an atmospheric pollutant, and organic   nitroso compounds are carcinogens found in some food and in cigarette   smoke.  This chemistry has the potential to provide a better   understanding of the role of the interactions of metalloporphyrins with   nitric oxides in physiological systems. The education plan focuses on   undergraduate research and the development of new laboratory experiments   and courses which emphasize the biological significance of inorganic   chemistry.",
