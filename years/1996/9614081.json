 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1993, Washington University, with funding from ARPA and NSF, began a  research program to create networking technology and a gigabit testbed  based on this technology. The Washington University is interested in making  the technology available to the networking and HPCC research communities,  to enable others to pursue more effectively their own research agendas in  high performance computing and communications.  This effort will fund a  workshop that would serve three purposes.  The first is to describe the  proposed program and the gigabit ATM technology on which it is based in  sufficient detail that the participants can determine its potential value  to them in their research programs.  The second purpose is to determine  what level of interest there may be in such a program, to help  representatives from NSF and possibly other agencies to decide if such a  program would merit their support.  The third purpose is to obtain input  from the attendees as to how the program might be shaped to suit their  particular needs.  The workshop will be held July 10 11, 1996 on the  Washington University campus.",
