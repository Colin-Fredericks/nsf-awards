 "awd_abstract_narration": "9525805  Arrigo  This proposal describes modeling studies of primary production in  the water column and sea ice for an NSF-funded field program to  take place in the southwest Ross Sea between October and March of  1996-97 and 1997-98.  The focus of the initial modeling studies  will be to derive initial estimates of primary productivity for  the Southern Ocean.  These initial estimates will be based on:   1) current understanding of the physiology, biochemistry and  ecology of Southern Ocean phytoplankton and sea ice algae; 2)  climatologies for sea ice cover, cloud cover, sea surface  temperature and algal pigments; and 3) existing modeling  approaches for depth-dependent (1-D) primary production in sea  ice and water column.  One of the primary goals is to make the  first determination of the relative amounts of primary production  in the water column and in the sea ice using a consistent, modern  estimation method (bio-optical modeling) for both systems.   Sensitivity analyses will then be performed to guide planning of  the ROAVERRS Project; these analyses will be directly applicable  to planning for JGOFS and GLOBEC activities related to the  question of estimating primary production in the Southern Ocean.   Specifically, they will study model sensitivity to sampling  scales (temporal and spatial) in the ROAVERRS study region and to  variation in the variables proposed for measurement during  ROAVERRS (e.g., algal bio-optics, photosynthetic parameters,  spectral quality of light, nutrient concentration, sea ice  thickness, snow cover, water column mixing rates, temperature).   Following completion of this modeling study, the ROAVERRS Project  will make improvements to the models based on an expanded data  base (e.g., tuning the model for different types of sea ice  habitat or phytoplankton blooms) and carry out testing of these  models against field observations.",
