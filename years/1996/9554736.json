 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematics is undergoing remarkable advances, the scope of  mathematical applications is broadening into new disciplines,  reaching a more diverse student population.  Courses and other  educational experiences for prospective mathematics teachers at all  levels provide an important wedge that will help bring about this  revolution in the undergraduate curriculum.  Just as many current  college faculty are not in a position to infuse contemporary  mathematics and its applications into their teaching, many  undergraduates who are currently preparing to teach at the  elementary and secondary levels are also not sufficiently aware of  important current mathematics.  It is important that the presence  of contemporary applications of mathematics be increased in the  undergraduate preparation of those who will teach at all levels.   To address this opportunity and challenge, workshops are scheduled  for the summers of 1996 and 1997.  These workshops will each be of  two-week duration, with 25 participants per workshop.  The  workshops in 1996 will be held at Virginia Commonwealth University  and the United States Military Academy.  The focus of each workshop  will be contemporary applications of mathematics in the broadly  defined areas of mathematical modeling, discrete mathematics, and  geometry.  They will feature mathematical topics of increasing  emphasis and importance.",
