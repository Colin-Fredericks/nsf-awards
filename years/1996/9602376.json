 "awd_abstract_narration": "TITLE:   Advancing Scientific and Technological Education in American Indian Communities    This is a conference project which proposes to help promote increased involvement of Indian people in scientific and technological areas so as to improve the lives of native individuals and communities while also promoting their latent creativity in scientific fields and society at large.  The intensive conference on this topic will involve national Indian organizations, Native American community leaders and members, leading Indian scientists and educators, and some representatives of main-stream (i.e. non-Indian) science and technology organizations.  Focused, prepared  presentations at the conference will serve to stimulate deliberations and planning by small breakout groups.  Indian college students trained in facilitating group discussions will help catalyze those deliberations.  A final plenary session will consider and integrate the work of the small groups generating plans for partnerships of communities, national Indian organizations, higher educational institutions, and industry.  There will be a document of the proceedings of the conference with all of the recommendations and summaries of the presentations.  The conference is expected to be held in the fall of 1996 or spring of 1997.",
