 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Randal A. Seburg has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research   Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Seburg received the doctoral degree from   the University of Wisconsin at Madison under the supervision of Professor   Robert J. McMahon.  Dr. Seburg will continue research at Purdue   University under the sponsorship of Professor Robert R. Squires.  The   postdoctoral research will focus on the investigation of reactive   intermediates using a flowing afterglow apparatus equipped with a   triple-qualrupole mass analyzer.  Such gas phase investigations probe the   intrinsic properties of molecules, providing data that is free of solvent   and counter-ion effects and directly relevant for comparison with theory.    Studies include the thermochemistry of carbynes using both theoretical   computations and experimental results, as well as the gas phase reactions   of charged biomolecules such as oligopeptides and oligonucleotides   generated using the electrospray ion technique.  The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as   an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge   and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in   contemporary chemical research and teaching.",
