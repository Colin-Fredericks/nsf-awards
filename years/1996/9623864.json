The method used will be the computational-fluid-dynamics (CFD)  technique with a two-layer turbulence mode.  The CFD code will be  validated by detailed flow and thermal measurements in a full-  scale test chamber and by emission data obtained from a small-  scale and a full-scale test chamber of stainless steel.    The research will investigate material emission, indoor air  quality, thermal comfort and energy consumption of buildings  simultaneously for the first time.  The results of this project  will provide the basis for the development or improvement of  industrial standards for material testing for obtaining reliable  emission data.  This will help building designers and owners to  select various types of building materials for better indoor air  quality.    This education will strengthen the Building Technology Program at  MIT.  This provides a unique opportunity for engineering and  architectural students to obtain experienced work with colleagues  in the complementary field in the design of healthy buildings  with energy efficiency.  The curriculums to be developed can also  be used by other schools and organizations.  ***",
