 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a new, multidisciplinary  research training program focused on the structural  biology of macromolecular assemblies.  A group of 15  faculty drawn from the Departments of Biological  Science, Chemistry and Physics have developed a  comprehensive and challenging program to train  undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students in  a wide range of state-of-the-art experimental and  theoretical approaches to structure and function.  Research areas to be emphasized include study of  filamentous  macromolecular assemblies responsible  for membrane structure and cell structure and  motility.   Participating undergraduate students  from Florida State University and Florida A& M will  gain research experience during the academic year  and summer term.  Graduate students will complete a  required set of new courses in macromolecular  assembly structure, dynamics, and computational  optimization.  Short, intense workshops will provide  hands-on training in a variety of techniques, and  there will be an annual symposium coupled with a  program review by external experts.   An unusual and  important aspect of the training at both graduate  and postdoctoral levels will be an emphasis on  development of new methodology.  Another is that  trainees at all levels will be able to use the  unique facilities of  the National High Magnetic  Field Laboratory, whose staff includes several of  the participating faculty.  The students trained  through this program are expected to have a critical  understanding of important biological phenomena of  cellular structure and motility, and of the powerful  new biophysical techniques needed to investigate  them successfully.",
