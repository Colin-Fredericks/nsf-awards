 "awd_abstract_narration": "9530526  Mason      This project is proposed as part of Intergovernmental  Oceanographic Commission (IOC) Baseline Trace Metal Study of  the  oceans.  The primary objective is to obtain needed data for  the  distribution, speciation and biogeochemcial cycling of Hg in  the  waters and atmosphere of the equatorial and South Atlantic  Ocean.  The field program will be conducted on the IOC cruise of the  R.V.  Knorr to these regions in the western Atlantic during  may/June  1996.  The research involves shipboard collections for total  Hg,  particulate and Hg species (i.e., reactive, elemental and  methylated Hg) in air and water, on-board Hg analyses, and  incubation experiments designed to study the biotic and  abiotic  sources of elemental and methylated Hg in the open ocean  waters.  Post cruise activities will include analyses of stored  samples  and additional incubation experiments.  This research is  designed  to complement and extend recent investigations of Hg in the  North  Atlantic Ocean (August, 1993) that were part of the IOC  Baseline  Trace Metal Study, and earlier Hg studies in the Pacific  Ocean.  ***",
