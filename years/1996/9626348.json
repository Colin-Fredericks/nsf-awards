 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS 9626348  Samarov  This research addresses the question of how intuitive and concise  linear model concepts and techniques can be extended to  nonparametric settings.  Nonparametric counterparts of such  commonly used linear model ideas as regression  coefficients,  correlation coefficients, coefficient of determination, and  principal components are considered.  The research also studies  nonparametric techniques for model diagnostics that can be used  for dimensionality reduction and to address the question of  adequacy of particular models.  Both asymptotic and finite sample  properties are studied, and the problem of developing reliable  data-based methods for smoothing parameter selection for  functionals and curves is addressed.  With the advent of computer data bases of unprecedented size and  complexity and with the dramatic increase in computer power, it  as become increasingly more desirable and possible to develop  more flexible models, concepts, and procedures that can be used  to study relationships between variables and to construct models  without relying on rigid global assumptions.  Much of the recent  work in statistics have addressed this need for more general and  flexible methods.  This research further extends this work with a  special focus on procedures that are counterparts of many  commonly used linear model concepts and that expose important  features in the data using intuitive and familiar ideas.",
