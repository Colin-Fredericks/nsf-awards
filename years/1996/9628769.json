 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Steven H. Strauss, Department of Chemistry, Colorado State   University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division for research into the   use of fluorinated closo-heteroborane anions as weakly coordinating   anions (WCAs) and for investigations into nonclassical metal  carbonyls.   Fluorinated closo-heteroborane anions will be developed as a new set of   WCAs that are stable under a wide variety of conditions, including high   temperatures and in aqueous acid and base solutions. These anions will be   relatively inexpensive and easy to prepare and will be applied to a   variety of problems involving structure and bonding, materials science,   and catalysis. The WCAs will be used as counterions with cationic metal   carbonyls that possess little or no metal-ligand pi backbonding. The   structure, bonding, and chemical reactivity of these complexes will be   studied and applications, including Diels-Alder and Michael addition   catalysis and lithium ion conductivity in polymer blends, will be   developed.  Many important laboratory and industrial processes are facilitated by   metal catalysts. This research centers about a class of compounds in   which a positively charged metal containing fragment (called a cation) is   counterbalanced by a large negatively charged species that does not   interact strongly with the metal (These are termed weakly coordinating   anions or WCAs.). Since cationic metal-WCA complexes are known to be good   catalysts for a variety of reactions, the new WCAs, to be studied in this   project, are important because they will be inexpensive and stable under   the harsh conditions encountered in real world application. Some of the   important industrial processes in which these compounds may be used   include gas purification, water gas shift catalysis, and methanol   synthesis catalysis. A particular application that will be studied is the   Cu(I)-catalyzed carbonylation of organic compounds in homogeneous   solution.",
