 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the widespread use of distributed and concurrent  systems and with the increase in the complexity of software  for such systems, it becomes important to develop various  methods for ensuring the quality of concurrent software  systems. This project explores various methods for automated  and semi-automated analysis and verification of concurrent  and distributed systems. In particular, the research seeks  methods based on temporal logic model checking for  verification of concurrent systems.    Although model checking has been applied fairly successfully  for verification of quite a few real-life systems, its  applicability to a wider class of practical systems has been  hampered by the state explosion problem (i.e. the enormous  increase in the size of the state space). In this research,  symmetry based techniques are used to overcome the state  explosion problem. In particular, symmetry is exploited for  verification of liveness properties of real-life concurrent  and distributed software systems. The effectiveness of  symmetry-based methods for model checking requires efficient  solutions to the orbit problem. A solution to the orbit  requires checking if two given global states are equivalent  under the symmetry. An efficient solution to this problem  facilitates the construction of the quotient structure by  collapsing each set of equivalent states into a single  state. The project investigates various efficient algorithms  for the orbit problem for many of the symmetries that occur  in practical systems. It is implementing an on-line model  checking system that exploits symmetry by simultaneously  constructing reduced global state graph (i.e. the quotient  structure) and exploring the partially generated quotient  structure for existence of certain fair strongly connected  components containing an incorrect computation.  ***",
