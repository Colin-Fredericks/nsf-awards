The triennial IUCr Congresses are the accepted international forum for the discussion and dissemination of new results and theoretical and experimental advances in crystallography.  Crystallography, through its primary tools, the diffraction of X-rays, neutrons and electrons by crystalline solids, is the principal method of obtaining accurate information on the three-dimensional structures of molecules and materials.  Such information is of fundamental importance in the development of many different branches of science, including chemistry, molecular biology, condensed matter physics, mineralogy and materials science.    The invited speakers and session leaders at the Congress are the acknowledged leaders in their specialties.  Because this will be the first IUCr Congress to be held in the United States since 1969, it provides an unusually valuable opportunity for large numbers of US scientists to meet with and learn from these distinguished colleagues from overseas.    Funds provided by the Foundation will be combined with matching contributions from the IUCr itself, to provide needed support of travel costs.  ***",
