 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this GOALI award the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and the   Synthetic Organic Program are supporting the educational efforts of Dr.   Brian P. Coppola and Christine E. Evans of the Department of Chemistry at   the University of Michigan and Dr. Anthony W. Czarnik, Director of   Biochemistry for the Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research headquarters of   the Warner-Lambert Company.  This team of academic and industrial   chemists will formally extend the integrated architecture that is being   created for the professional development stream in the undergraduate   program at the University of Michigan chemistry department.  This novel conceptual design will have two parallel outcomes.  The first   result is a new undergraduate course,  Professional Development in the   Chemical Sciences, taken during the Junior year.  The subject matter of   the course will include critical analysis of written and oral   presentations, written and oral technical communication proficiency, and   an introduction to the multi-faceted features of professional life   including professional ethics.  The creation of this course is a unique   educational bridge between the traditional content of undergraduate   programs and the needs of beginning a professional life in chemistry.    Second, it is proposed to strengthen this bridge further by creating a   parallel set of course materials and objectives, through an   academic-industrial partnership, that also address the needs of   post-baccalaureate chemists who are already in practice.  In addition to   the traditional undergraduate course structure, the team will explore   alternative modes of delivery that might better address the needs of the   post-baccalaureate population.",
