 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gelfand    Recent computational advances have made it feasible to fit   hierarchical models in a wide range of serious applications.  With   this capacity various issues in model determination arise.  This   research studies the selection of a best model within a collection of   such models.  It concerns itself with the trade-off between goodness   of fit and parsimony and the inappropriateness or shortcomings of   customary criteria.  The research also addresses the matter of model   adequacy.  With hierarchical models, model failures can occur at each   stage.  Approaches for identifying the existence of such failures and   their nature are examined by the investigator.  Finally, for   hierarchical models hyperprior specification is often vague.  This   work considers conditions under which the resultant posterior is a   proper distribution.    The modern intellectual contribution of statistics is modeling and   inference.  In working with scientists from other fields, the   statistician helps to formulate appropriate models for the   scientists' problems and data as well as to indicate how inference can   be developed which provides answers to the questions which motivated   the scientists' investigations.  With the wide availability of high   speed computing, increasingly sophisticated models are being   considered permitting the research effort to focus on the   determination of the most appropriate model for the application   rather than having to settle for an obviously inadequate one.    Nonetheless, models must offer some simplification or else they are   no easier to understand than the complex phenomenon they are   modeling.  This research addresses several important issues in the   process of determining a satisfying model.",
