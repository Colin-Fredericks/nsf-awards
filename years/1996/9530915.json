In doing so, it investigates the relevance of two  ideas to integration of planning and control.  First, it studies  the relationship between a plan element (or action or behavior)  and the concept of a reference model in control theory.  This, in  conjunction with the arsenal of tools available in control theory  for the synthesis and analysis of controllers that guarantee  reference model following, may then be used to formally specify  the control performance of each action.  The second aspect of  this research deals with the existence of multiple actions in a  plan, connected together through some relationships, and having  some ordering.  To address this, the use of multiple reference  models (in a control system) and means to switch between them in  a stable fashion is investigated.  By studying these problems, an  integrated view of certain elements of planning and control may  be derived, where reference models are related to actions,  switching rules to the initiation and termination of actions,  switching sequences to the admissible output of plan executors in  deliberative systems, etc.  In this manner, the planned work  would complement ongoing planning research in AI by providing the  control oriented knowledge necessary for robust design.  The  theoretical results developed in this effort will be applied to  quadruped locomotion (as an example problem), and a kernel of  gait controllers, and the set of admissible rules for gait  switching and tuning that guarantee stable locomotion will be  formally derived.",
