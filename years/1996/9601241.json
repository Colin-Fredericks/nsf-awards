It requests funds for participation by a graduate student  and for travel to Taiwan.  The primary objective of this  project is to produce a tsunami inundation map for the  entire Taiwan coastline.  The tasks include validation of  the numerical model and use of the numerical model to  predict the effect of tsunami inundation along the Taiwan  coastline.  An educational videotape will be produced to  illustrate the generation, propagation, and the coastal  effect of tsunami. Tsunami are among the most disastrous  natural calamities on the shore of  the Pacific.  Recent and  older observations have demonstrated the suddenness of  tsunami occurrence along the Taiwan coast.  This is a very  practical and important project, which not only can validate  the P.I.'s tsunami inundation model, but also provide a tool  for future land use planning  and for reducing potential  damage from these natural hazards.  Furthermore, this  project provides an excellent opportunity for a graduate  student to have a hands-on experience to carry out a project  in an environment significantly different from the U.S.  The  project is jointly supported by the Taiwan National Science  Council and the NSF.",
