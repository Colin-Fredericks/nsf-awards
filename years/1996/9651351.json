 "awd_abstract_narration": "The undergraduate teaching laboratory serves to expand upon the concepts taught in the classroom and demonstrates that science is a dynamic process of learning. In order to provide a research environment in its undergraduate biochemistry teaching laboratory, the Department of Chemistry has developed a curriculum based on investigative learning. The laboratory is based on a bioluminescent enzyme known as luciferase. The major objective is to clone the luciferase gene and ultimately purify and characterize the enzyme. Thus, the student is confronted by a real research problem: how to isolate an enzyme with a known function and characterize it. Not only can students learn the strategies and techniques used in research, but they can also develop necessary critical thinking skills.   The complete development of this laboratory curriculum is dependent upon the addition of two luminometers. The luminometer, an instrument for detecting photons, is the instrument of choice for the measurement of luciferase activity. Quick, reliable measurements of enzyme activity are crucial for the purification and subsequent characterization of luciferase. The addition of luminometers to the biochemistry laboratory can increase the quality of the experiments presented in this course.",
