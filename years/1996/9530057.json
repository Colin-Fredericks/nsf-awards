 "awd_abstract_narration": "9530057  Coffroth            Symbioses  between  cnidarians and dinoflagellates  in  the  genus  Symbiodinium  are  widespread in the  marine  environment.  Their importance to reef-building corals and reef nutrient cycles  is  well  documented, but surprisingly little is known about  the  ontogency  of the symbiosis and the demographics of zooxanthellae  populations  within  their  hosts.   An  understanding  of  these  processes   is   essential   to  understanding   the   symbiosis.  Physiologic  adaptations to conditions such  as  temperature  and  light  may  in fact be mediated by the demographics of the  algal  symbionts.   The objective of this researech is to determine  the  ontogeny  of  the  symbiosis in a gorgonian coral  that  produces  azooxanthellate  planulae  larvae.  Dr.  Coffroth  will   examine  initial   zooxanthellate  infection  in   planulae   larvae   and  characterized  the population structure of the  zooxanthellae  in  established  symbioses  in  adult  colonies.   These  data   will  determine  whether  the observed host-algal association  are  the  result  of  selection (mediated by the host or alga),  stochastic  process or simply suitability of the host \"habitat\" to the alga.          Understanding  the  population  dynamics  of  zooxanthellae  communities   has  important  ramifications  for   studying   the  symbiosis   and  how  the  symbiosis  responds  to  environmental  changes.   It is now recognized that zooxanthellae are a  diverse  group.   If  this  diversity  is  widespread  among  single  host  colonies  or if the association is in a state of continual  flux,  then  changes  in functional and physiologic traits  may  reflect  changes in the algal community structure. In this case it will be  critical  to examine each component of the symbiosis and consider  the  population  dynamics and ecological responses  of  both  the  coral  and  the algae to understand and preserve reef ecosystems.  The  first  step,  however,  is to quantify  this  diversity  a nd  address how this diversity is established.",
