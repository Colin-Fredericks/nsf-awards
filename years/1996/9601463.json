 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary      The  purpose  of the research described in this proposal  is  the  development of rapid computational tools for the analysis of  the  three  dimensional  structure of biological  macromolecules.  The  goal  is  to  combine graphical techniques designed to  highlight  functionally important features of macromolecules with  numerical  and  theoretical methods that allow a user to extract  meaningful  numbers   about  important  physical  properties  from  a   three  dimensional  structure. Capabilities of this type  of  have  been  incorporated   into  the  GRASP  (Graphical  Representation   and  Analysis  of  Structural Properties) computer program  which  was  developed in the current funding period. In the past three  years  GRASP evolved into one of the most widely used analysis tools  in  Structural Biology. A goal of the current proposal is to continue  the  development of GRASP by making it more widely accessible and  through   the  incorporation  of  new  functionalities  and   new  quantitative analysis tools.    The  major  application  of GRASP has been  the  calculation  and  representation  of the electrostatic potentials of  proteins  and  nucleic  acids  on  the  molecular surface.  The  potentials  are  calculated    from    finite-difference    solutions    to    the  Poisson-Boltzmann  (PB) equation obtained  from  essentially  the  same  algorithm  used  in  the  DelPhi  program  which  was  also  developed  in this lab. It has become commonplace for the  report  of  a  new  structure of a protein to include one or  more  GRASP  pictures  representing  solutions to  the  PB  equation.  However  Silicon  Graphics  workstations  are  required  to  depict  these  images,  a factor which has to some extent limited their use.  In  order  to  make GRASP images more widely available,  we  plan  to  convert  the graphical routines within GRASP to output  graphical  descriptions in VRML, the 3D scene description language  proposed  for  the   World  Wide  Web  (WWW).  We  also  plan  to  introduce  interfacing tools which will facilitate communication with  other  programs, will simplify the learning curve for the use of current  functionalities  and  will  make it  possible  to  integrate  new  quantitative analysis tools within GRASP.    A  second  goal  of  the current proposal is the  creation  of  a  database of GRASP images for the entire Protein Data Base  (PDB).  GRASP  molecular  surface images of electrostatic  potential  and  curvature  will be created for each protein in the  PDB  will  be  stored  in  a  database.  2D and 3D GRASP  images  will  be  made  available  for viewing over the WWW. It is anticipated  that  the  wide availability of these images will lead to the development of  a  new  structure-function relationships and, ultimately, to  the  creation  of  new  surface-based data bases which  will  make  it  possible to deduce function and functionally active regions given  a  three dimensional structure. The final goal of the proposal is  the  integration of quantitative analysis tools within GRASP.  In  particular,  a user will be able, in real-time, to  obtain  pKais  solvation,  conformational  and binding  free  energies  for  any  structure depicted graphically on the screen.    The  significance of the proposed research to the advancement  of  knowledge  is  manifest  in  the  success  of  GRASP  which   has  demonstrated  the  impact  of interactive  quantitative  analysis  tools  on  the analysis of macromolecular structure and  function  relationships.  The  database  of  surface  properties  and   the  addition  of  new  GRASP functionalities should  have  comparable  impact  on  the ability to exploit the vast amount of information  embodied  in  the  three dimensional structure  of  proteins  and  nucleic acids.",
