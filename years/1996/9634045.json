 "awd_abstract_narration": "9634045  Tardif   This GOALI proposal is for the PI to spend three summer months with Schlumberger Austin Research working in the area of finite-capacity scheduling and diagnostics.  She will be working directly with the End-to End Simulation group in developing the diagnostic tool.  The project has two main goals.  The first is to tailor MRP-C to facilitate its implementation at a few key manufacturing facilities.  Special attention will be given to the modeling of yield loss in order to capture potential correlation between cycle time and the number of defective items produced.  The second goal is to encourage managers and production schedulers to use MRP-C in their daily planning and to assess its impact on decision-making and on-time delivery performance.  The study will provide a great opportunity to determine the information needed by managers and schedulers to make and justify decisions and the desired format for such information.  It will make possible investigation of more systematic and graphical ways to represent alternative schedules.  The availability of advanced computer equipment and technical support at Schlumberger research labs and manufacturing plants makes it an ideal site to develop and implement new procedures which rely heavily on computers and information technology.   The relationship of the PI and her industrial partner, Schlumberger, should greatly benefit her career.  Her proposal is well thought out and has high potential for making a real impact on industry.  The synergistic effect of this academic-industry relationship should prove very productive.",
