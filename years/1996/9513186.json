 "awd_abstract_narration": "9513186  Baker      The award will support the travel of Dr. Ian Baker, Thayer   School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, to enable him to  conduct collaborative research with Dr. Paul Munroe of the  School of Materials Science and Engineering at the University  of New South Wales.  The proposed work aims to further an  understanding of the relationship between grain boundary   structure and chemistry and the occurrence of intergranular  fracture in FeAl, a material of some potential commercial  importance.    Poor ductility and brittle fracture are important drawbacks of  intermetallic compounds.  The focus of this study is on grain  boundaries (GBs) in bicrystals.  The effects of boundary  character and constitutional disorder, changing the ration of Fe  to Al, will be examined with a view to determining why some GBs  fracture and others do not.  The effect of ternary alloying  additions will also be examined to determine why some alloying  elements suppress grain boundary fracture.  The work proposed  will use a field emission gun scanning transmission electron  microscope, FEG STEM, which is jointly operated by the University  of New South Wales and the University of Sydney.  The project  brings together the complementary research interests of the  investigators with access to specialized equipment.",
