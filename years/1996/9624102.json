 "awd_abstract_narration": "9624102  Menendez:  This project comprises an experimental/theoretical light scattering study of the dynamical and electronic properties of fullerenes. Experiments on systems ranging from molecular solids to isolated molecules in the vapor phase, using both  resonance and off-resonance incident radiation, will elucidate the interplay between molecular vibrations and rotations, the effects of solid-state packing and disorder, and the electron/vibrational coupling.  The experiments will be analyzed theoretically by means of first-principles calculations and powerful time-correlator techniques for light scattering. Results from this project will contribute to the understanding of technologically important problems, e.g. details of the dynamical Jahn-Teller interaction thought to be responsible for superconductivity in doped fullerenes, and will shed light on fundamental problems, such as vibrational localization induced by defects or anharmonicity.  ***This project comprises an experimental/theoretical study of the properties of fullerenes, a new class of carbon-based materials.  Fullerenes are of great scientific and technological interest due to their unusual properties and the possibility of important applications, ranging from superconductivity to the fabrication of diamond films.  Experiments involving scattering of laser light will be performed on systems ranging from molecular to isolated molecules in the vapor phase, in order to elucidate the interplay between molecular vibrations and rotations, the effects of solid- state packing and disorder, and the interactions between the electrons and vibrations.  The experiments will be interpreted theoretically by means of powerful computer techniques.  The results will contribute to understanding of technologically important problems such as the quantum mechanical mechanisms responsible for superconductivity in fullerenes, and will also shed light on fundamental problems such as vibrational localization.***",
