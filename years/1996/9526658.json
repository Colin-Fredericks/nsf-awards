The primary focus of this development will be in the area of massively parallel   computers. Currently, much progress is being made in the field of chemical dynamics.  This   progress is being fueled both by the development of new and clever computational methods and   the incredible advances in computer power. Such progress means that for the first time,   theoretical chemists can actually envision competing with their experimental colleagues in   providing accurate accounts of important chemical phenomena. The aim of the research outlined   in this proposal is to harness the power of massively parallel computing to enable chemists to   apply rigorous theoretical methods to larger, more complex chemical systems.       At the heart of chemistry lies the motion of atoms and molecules.  The description of the   motions of interacting atomic nuclei provides the most basic and fundamental understanding of   chemical processes.  An important goal of theoretical chemical physics is to describe chemical   reactions from first principles alone.   Because atoms are very small, their motions are often not   adequately explained by ordinary Newtonian mechanics, instead, quantum mechanics is required.     Although the quantum mechanical equations that apply to all of chemistry have been known for   most of this century, only in the past several years has a complete, accurate theoretical   description of a chemical reaction been given, and only for the simplest chemical process, the   interaction of a hydrogen atom and a hydrogen molecules.   There is a huge difference between   knowing the form of an equation and having the methodological and computational tools which   enable one to solve it.    Chemical dynamicists for the most part have not yet exploited the huge potential of massive ly   parallel computing. The research proposed here is to develop and implement a hierarchical   parallel model for time-dependent quantum dynamics.   The researchers expect that this model   will allow them to obtain realistic descriptions of much larger and more complex chemical   systems than is currently possible.   They will apply this model to important and challenging   problems including the two most important reactions in combustion chemistry.   One very   important property of this model, which has already been implemented, is its ability to handle   easily and efficiently chemical systems having high overall angular momentum. Many theoretical   efforts concentrate on the computationally more tractable systems with zero total angular   momentum; such states are rarely found in nature however. There are often both quantitative and   qualitative differences between high and low angular momentum states.  Therefore, in order to   compare theoretical calculations with experiments it is often necessary to obtain an accurate   description of nonzero angular momentum states.",
