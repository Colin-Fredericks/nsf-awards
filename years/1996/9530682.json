 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds for a pilot study applying cosmogenic nuclide exposure ages to glacial deposits in the Torngat Mountains, northern Labrador, that were deposited by the eastern margin of the Laurentide Ice Sheet.  This sequence of moraines and drift represents at least two successively limited glaciations of the Torngat Mountains and is a \"type area\" for study of weathering zones in North America.  Despite over a century of study, the chronology of this classic sequence of differentially weathered glacial deposits is highly uncertain.  Furthermore, the glacial history of this region is a key component in reconstructing the past history of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, which exerted a major influence on global climate during the last glacial period.    Samples for measurement of cosmogenic 10Be and other cosmogenic nuclides will be  collected to evaluate the suitability of this region for exposure dating studies.  The preliminary 10Be data will be used to create an absolute exposure age chronology for the region, and to evaluate the correlation of previously mapped and correlated deposits.    Potential results of the proposed work and its possible extensions include:     An absolute chronology for a largely undated glacial sequence in  an area that is crucial for reconstructing the margins of the  Laurentide Ice Sheet at the last glacial maximum (LGM).     Age constraints for glacial deposits and ice sheet limits related  to pre-LGM Laurentide Ice Sheet advances in Labrador.     Constraints on erosion rates and weathering history of rock  surfaces in sub-Arctic/Arctic regions.",
