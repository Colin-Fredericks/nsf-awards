Study of direct interfacial electron transfer between these intermediates and solid electrode substrates will be investigated, using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry, as a means of probing the relationship between metalloenzyme intermediate structure and redox function in enzyme catalysis.  Oxyfedrryl intermediates in the peroxidase and cytochrome P 450 enzymic pathways will be the focus of these studies.  The implications of this research include the ability to characterize the structure an redox properties of normally inaccessible enzyme intermedicates and the development of viable commercial catalytic electrocatalytic devices based on enzyme chemistry.  In the educational component of this program, efforts will  iclude modernization of the course curriculum and teaching methodology used in undergraduate Quantitative Analysis involving a \"discovery\"-based approach, expansion of current efforts to introduce undergraduate and graduate students to the scientific literature, and development of an integrated teaching/research program, which involves high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, that can serve as a holistic model of the scientific enterprise.  %%%  My research is focussed on studies that probe on a molecular level how enzyme active site structure is related to function for, in particular, horseradish peroxidase and cytochrome P450, enzymes that play important roles in biosynthesis, metabolism, and detoxfication.  We have found that by dissolving enzymes in organic solvents it is possible to generate highly reactive oxyferryl enzyme intermediates inaccessible to study in aqueous solution.  We have also shown that in organic solvents we can use electochemi call methods to learn about the redox character of enzymes.  We now intend to use a wide range of spectroscopic and electrochemical methods to probe the oxyferryl intermediates in horseradish peroxidase and cytochrome P 450.  The implications include the ability to map out individual steps in an enzyme's catalytic cycle and to develop viable (electro) catalytic methods based on enzyme chemistry.  My educational efforts have been  focused on involving students as early as possible in the research experience.  This has involved redesigning the undergraduate Quantitative analysis course, designing projects and assignments that introduce students at all levels to the scientific literature, and opening my research laboratory to high school and undergraduate as well as graduate students.  During the next four years, I intend to author a major textbook/lab manual for Quantitative Analysis, expand my efforts to make students   comfortable with the primary scientific literature, and develop an integrated teaching/research program, that can serve as a holistic model of the scientific enterprise.  ***",
