An  example of strong correlation is the physics of the  fractional quantum Hall effect, where an electron gas is  subject to a high magnetic field so that only the lowest  Landau level is partially occupied.  A key question is these  systems is whether the composite fermions can be described  by Fermi liquid theory.  The project proposes to continue  studying this important system and to explore new  experiments which may provide further information on this  fascinating new state.  The tools being used include many-  body perturbation theory, renormalization group analysis,  and, at times, numerical analysis.  A successful completion  of this project will have significant impact on a broad area  of condensed matter physics, including other strongly  correlated materals, such as high temperature  superconductors and heavy fermion metals.  %%%  This project theoretically investigates systems of electrons  where their repulsion plays a crucial role in determining  their physical properties, and the effects of random  disorder on such systems.  An example that constitutes an  important focus is the physics of the fractional quantum  Hall effect, in which a magnetic field is applied to a gas  of electrons that forms at an interface in semiconductors.  The investigator is a distinguished leader in this area of  condensed-matter physics, using state-of-the art methods.  A successful completion of this project will have  significant impact on a broad area of condensed matter  physics, including other strongly correlated materals, such  as high temperature superconductors and heavy fermion  metals.  ***",
