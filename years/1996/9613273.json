 "awd_abstract_narration": "9613273  Mathews    Biomass wastes such as liquid whey effluents from the dairy  industry are a burden on the environment due to their high  biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). Treatment of these wastes  to meet environmental standards is both capital and energy  intensive.  This proposal examines the use of whey permeate  in the production of a road deicer substitute for sodium  chloride, since currently used deicers cause extensive  corrosion-related damage to the highway infrastructure and  environmental damage to water supplies and soils. The  proposed research will examine the use of biomass wastes in  the production of substitute deicers, calcium magnesium  acetate (CMA) and calcium magnesium propionate (CMP), via a  two-stage bacterial fermentation process.  In addition,  a  mathematical model  will be to describe continuous cell-  recycle fermentation in coculture systems.    Growth kinetics studies will be conducted using the bacteria  Propionibacterium acidipropionici and Lactobacillus  plantarum in monoculture and coculture systems.  The effect  of substrate concentration, pH and other parameters on  growth and organic acid productivity will be determined.  A  synergistic growth kinetics model that includes substrate  and product inhibition kinetics will be developed, and  kinetic constants will be obtained from the data.  Continuous flow cell-recycle fermentation studies will be  conducted for coculture and two-stage fermentation systems  to determine acid productivity and product concentrations.  A model will be developed to describe continuous flow cell-  recycle fermentation for single and coculture systems, and  the model will be verified with the experimental data.    This research will develop data and basic knowledge required  in the design of an innovative fermentation system for the  conversion of whey effluents to useful chemicals.  The  methodology and approach developed can be utilized in  processes to convert a variety of inexpensive sugar  substrates and biomass hydrolysat es into low-cost  biodegradable deicers.",
