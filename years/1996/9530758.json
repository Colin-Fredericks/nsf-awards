The Southern Ocean is recognized as an important , yet poorly  resolved, region of the world ocean.  It is thought that this  region plays a critical role in global carbon dynamics, as well  as strongly influencing the flux of heat and salt between the  Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans.  Attempts to improve our  understanding of this region and its role in the global carbon  budget depend on our ability to adequately assess those processes  which control or constrain the rates of carbon fixation and air-  sea exchange of CO2.  Recent observations in the Southern Ocean  suggest that mesoscale variability in physical, chemical and  biological properties limits our ability to provide accurate  large-scale estimates of important rate processes.  Our  understanding of carbon flux in the Southern Ocean thus depends  upon resolution of connections between mesoscale and large-scale  processes.    The mesoscale dynamics of the Polar Front region of the Antarctic  Circumpolar Current will be investigated using an instrumented  towed vehicle (SeaSoar) to resolve the physical and biological  fields over horizontal spatial scales of 1-150 km, with 2m  vertical resolution within the upper 400m.  High resolution  surveys of physical and biological properties will be made during  three cruises in the Polar Front (Oct `97, Dec-Jan `97/'98, Mar  `98). Towed instrumentation will document the physical and  biological structure associated with mixing and interleaving of  mesoscale features.  The high resolution surveys of physical  properties will  allow the determination of the relationship  between lateral processes and local vertical mixing.  Resolution  of these mesoscale circulation features will be critical for the  evaluation of the properties measured at discrete sampling  stations, and will provide the regional context for evaluation of  carbon flux at given locations.    Objectives are:  1) determine the characteristics and spatial scales of the  physical and biological fields in the Polar Frontal region of the  Antarctic Circumpolar Current system;  2) evaluate the role of mesoscale circulation in mixing heat,  salt, and biogeochemical properties into and out of the euphotic  zone;  3) determine, using bio-optical indices, the spatial scales of  photoadaptation of the autorophic assemblage in the Polar Front  region;  4) incorporate mesoscale patterns of physical and biological  property distribution into a high resolution regional ocean  circulation model.",
