The major focuses of the proposed effort are: (1) The study of the oxidation mechanisms and flame structure of C2-chlorinated hydrocarbons and their mixtures with non-chlorinated hydrocarbons.   Laminar flame speed determinations will be made on the premixed flames, and extinction stretch rates measured for the nonpremixed flames.  The effects of C/H/Cl ratio, fuel structure, flame temperature, and inhibition due to chlorination will be assessed along with the development of a comprehensive chemical reaction mechanism;  (2) The study of soot formation in chlorinated hydrocarbon diffusion flames.  This will include the quantification of the structure of non-sooting and near sooting flames, the determination of the soot inception and extinction strain-rate limits, the mapping of the soot profile in order to assess the effects of chlorination on soot nucleation, growth and oxidation, and the development of detailed kinetic models of soot formation in C/H/O/Cl systems.  This latter task represents a new area of research for the PI.",
