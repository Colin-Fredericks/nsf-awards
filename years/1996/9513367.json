 "awd_abstract_narration": "95-13367  Golden           The approach to unveiling the mechanism of circadian oscillators in this project focuses on the least-complex and most technically-approachable organism in which a biological clock has been demonstrated, namely the cyanobacterium, Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942. The technical advantages that accrue from using this organism are that it has a small genome which is easily manipulated genetically, and that a bioluminescent strain has been developed in which the monitoring of circadian gene expression is the most flexible and facile of any system presently available. Screening of thousands of colonies for mutations that disrupt the clock or otherwise cause aberrant rhythmic behavior is possible within a single experiment. Therefore, this cyanobacterial system has excellent tools for detailed molecular genetic analyses and for clock investigations. The project will use this system to address three aspects of biological rhythmicity:   (1) identification and characterization of genes that are involved in generating circadian rhythms,  (2) characterization of the mechanism by which the oscillator controls rhythmic outputs, and (3) assessment of the fitness advantage that organisms derive from their circadian oscillators.  Living organisms at all levels of biological complexity manifest circadian (daily) rhythms which are controlled by an internal \"clock.\" The biochemical nature of these biological clocks has been elusive, but one principle which has emerged is that their fundamental properties are conserved in all organisms in which circadian behavior has been observed, from bacteria to mammals. This principle has encouraged the hope that the biochemical mechanism has also been conserved, at least in terms of the general components and composition of the clock. This project investigates the composition of the biological clock by using the simplest organism known to show circadian rhythms: a cyanobacterium. Many processes in humans, including sleeping/waking, body temperature , gene expression, cell division, and enzymatic activities, are regulated by the biological clock.. In addition, these clocks are also the timers that measure the day length in timing of reproductive processes in plants and animals. Therefore, understanding the biochemical mechanism of- circadian clocks is of fundamental biological interest and may lead to insights which will be useful for example, in agriculture.  ***",
