 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carleton and St. Olaf Colleges Summer Mathematics Program    Mathematics faculty from Carleton and St. Olaf Colleges are  engaged in an intensive four-week summer mathematics program for  talented undergraduate women.  Forty-eight young women will  participate over the three years.  The program is staffed by  mathematicians who are active professionals and outstanding  teachers.  The students immerse themselves in mathematics, living  and working in a supportive community of women scholars  (undergraduates, graduates, and post-graduates) who are  passionate about learning and doing mathematics.  The program is  intended to excite these young women about mathematics and  mathematical careers, to provide them with the tools they will  need to succeed in a mathematical career, and to connect them to  a network of fellow female mathematicians.    Students attend a lecture course which meets on Tuesday and  Thursday mornings and a seminar which meets on Monday, Wednesday,  and Friday mornings.  The seminar has a small-group work time,  led by a female teaching assistant, on Monday and Wednesday  afternoons.  In each of the classes, the students are introduced  to fields of mathematics beyond calculus that students usually do  not have the opportunity to study in a standard undergraduate  mathematics program.  Possible topics for these courses include  algebraic coding theory, graph theory, combinatorics, game  theory, and number theory.  Through these courses, and the  homework assigned in them, the students have an opportunity to  improve their skills in conjecture and proof, written and oral  expression, mathematical modelling, and library research.  Each  student will receive, at the close of the program, written  evaluations of her performance and accomplishments from her  instructors.    Recreational problem solving is offered each Monday evening for  those students who want to work on solving interesting problems.   Four afternoons are devoted to teaching a number of computer  applications,  from the basics of everyday computer communication  to the latest in mathematical computation.  Use of the computer  for communication and computation is a daily routine during the  program.  Each Tuesday afternoon there is a discussion on a topic  pertaining to the students' continued scholarship: succeeding as  a math major, career options, choosing and surviving a graduate  program, and being a woman scientist.  Each Tuesday and Thursday  there is a colloquium on a stimulating area of mathematics.  One  Friday afternoon the students take a field trip to the Geometry  Center in Minneapolis.",
