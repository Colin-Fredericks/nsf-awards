 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor John Weeks is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to study the theory of inhomogeneous and   confined fluids.  Weeks will use a novel and physically suggestive method   for treating nonuniform fluids that combines, in a self-consistent way, a   mean field treatment of the attractive forces with a potentially exact   treatment of the repulsive force correlations.   The method yields a   nonuniform repulsive force reference fluid whose structure approximates   that of the full system.  A second major theme of the research   generalizes the work by David Chandler on a Gaussian field theory for   density fluctuations in liquids, where excluded volume effects are taken   into account.  This allows a new and physically motivated way of deriving   important classes of integral equations.  Proposed applications include   wetting and drying effects at walls, adsorption in slit pores and   nanotubes, polymers, and the free liquid-vapor interface.  Both   analytical theory and computer simulations will be employed in this   research.  Experiments have shown that both the static and dynamic properties of   nonuniform fluids, particularly when confined in small pores or slits,   differ dramatically from those of uniform systems.  New theoretical ideas   are needed to help make sense of these surprising results that impact on   a number of basic research areas in chemistry, physics, and fluid   mechanics.  In addition, these ideas could have practical applications to   materials processing operations involving lubrication, friction and wear.",
