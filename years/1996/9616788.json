The recent  legislative and regulatory initiatives are providing further  pressures for accelerating these changes.  These are resulting in  the disintegration of the heavily entrenched vertically  integrated structure.  With the release of the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission Orders 888 and 889, a foundation for the  rules of the road of the new regime has been established.  This  workshop will focus on the technical and engineering issues  associated with the restructuring of the industry. The Workshop  will provide a forum for some of the leading electric power  system experts to exchange views and develop a compendium of  research needs and draft the blueprint for research directions.   The Proceedings of prepared presentations, papers and discussions  and the summarized recommendations will provide a conference  record that will be disseminated to the power research community  at large.  ***",
