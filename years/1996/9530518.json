University of Colorado    Title: A Knowledge-Based Approach to Climate Analysis and                  Forecasting        Information regarding the climate system is often imprecise,   incomplete, vague, or uncertain.  A significant part of this   information exists as empirical facts and rules, expressed in   qualitative form.  The objective of this study is to develop a   system that can manipulate qualitative information is such a way as   to provide understanding about observed climate changes.        The appropriate method to reach this objective is based on concepts   and techniques of expert systems and artificial intelligence.  The   information about parameters of the climate system will be   presented both in quantitative and qualitative forms.    Relationships between climatic variables will be expressed as   production rules written in IF-THEN format.  Each rule will contain   a certainty factor that represents a numerical measure of the   confidence one has in the validity of a rule.  Two methods will be   used to combine certainty factors.  The first method is based on   the Dempster-Sharper theory, and the second one on the Bayesian   scheme.        The system will be able to evaluate the future state of various   climatic variables (such as temperature, precipitation, atmospheric   pressure, etc.) and of macroclimatic features (such as centers of   action, jet streams, upper atmospheric troughs and ridges, etc.).   It will also explain why the conclusion was reached and how certain  it is.  This system may also be considered as a decision support  system valuable for recording ideas and retrieving necessary  information that will facilitate discussions about observed and   anticipated climate changes.  The grant will support the prototype   development which will focus on the Northern Atlantic.   Then  the system will be expanded to the entire  Northern Hemisphere.   The system will be useful both for  climatolog ists and  decisionmakers.  It will find different  applications in fisheries,  agriculture, navigation, recreation and  other climate-related  industries.",
