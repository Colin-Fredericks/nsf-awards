This   equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the   following: (1)  solid state structural studies of proteins and inorganic   systems (2)   structural studies of biologically active natural products   (3) structural studies of the estrogen receptor (4) structural studies of   protein-carbohydrate interactions (5) structures and dynamics of nucleic   acid complexes (6)  high resolution NMR studies of chemical and   biochemical systems at high pressure and (7)  sol-gel processing of   advanced ceramic materials (8)  nanoporous coordination networks (9)    donor solvent-assisted synthesis of inorganic materials (10)  size   effects in dielectric and electrooptic ceramic oxides (11)    characterization of electrochemically modified surfaces, and (12)    nanporous extended networks based on supramolecular bonding   Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.   It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier   research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis, and in biology",
