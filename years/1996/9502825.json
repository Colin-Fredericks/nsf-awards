Specifically, the  investigations are designed to increase the understanding of  how chirality and symmetry affect liquid crystalline  behavior. A variety of phenomena related to ferroelectric  and antiferroelectric liquid crystals will be studied  including the dynamics of the electroclinic effect, low  frequency second harmonic generation in ferroelectric liquid  crystals, spatially periodic polarizations, the behavior of  the antiferroelectric -\"disordered\" phase transition, and  the antiferroelectric - ferroelectric phase transition. The  effects of symmetry-breaking surfaces as they relate to  liquid crystalline polarizations will be probed. Related  investigations on ferroelectric liquid crystals will also be  performed, including studies of ionic adsorption and  enantiomeric concentration fluctuations. Finally, a new  thrust area involving liquid crystals in confined geometries  will be explored, with special attention paid to the role of  the large surface-to-volume ratio of the host matrix as it  relates to chiral liquid crystals. A battery of experimental  tools will be used, including static and dynamic light  scattering, dielectric relaxation, magnetic and electric  birefringence and other electrooptic measurements, magnetic  susceptometry, and Freedericksz techniques.  %%%  This research is designed to increase the understanding of  how chirality and symmetry affect liquid crystalline  behavior. Symmetry plays an important role in liquid  crystalline behavior. In a smectic C phase composed of  chiral molecules, for example, one finds a macroscopic  polarization in the plane of the smectic layers. At a  symmetry-breaking interface there exists a polarization  normal to the surface; if the molecules are chiral, lack  inversion symmetry, and are tilted with respect to the  interface, an additional component of polarization may  reside at and parallel to the interfac e. Chirality may also  affect the nature of a phase transition, or introduce  entirely new phases such as the blue phases. The proposed  research will provide a deeper fundamental understanding of  these phenomena, and it may also impact the technological  infrastructure as well. Work under the prior grant led to a  new display technology; the results of work to be performed  under the proposed research have the potential to affect  current scientific and technological thinking, and possibly  have impact on the display industry as well.",
