 "awd_abstract_narration": "9531566  Bisch       This is a project for mathematical research in the theory of   operator algebras that deals, in particular, with analytical and  combinatorial aspects of the Jones theory of subfactors.  New  hierarchies of finite-dimensional algebras, generalizing the  Temperley-Lieb algebras in a natural way, will be used to study the  structure of subfactors.  These algebras capture, for instance, the  symmetry coming from an intermediate subfactor and can be viewed as a  certain minimal product of the standard invariant associated to two  subfactors.  A variety of new and interesting combinatorial structures  appears naturally in this process.  The technique of studying a  subfactor through its intermediate subfactors is very natural, since  it is on the classical level (i.e., the group level) just the analysis  of a given group through its subgroups.  It is planned to extend and  refine the available intermediate subfactors techniques by studying  the finite-dimensional algebras canonically associated to these  subfactors.  Popa systems, a certain natural system of inclusions of  finite-dimensional algebras of symmetries, will play a key role in  this analysis.  Computational aspects of these symmetries will be  examined, and it is planned to construct and analyze explicit examples  of subfactors and commuting squares.  Possible new interrelations of  the theory of subfactors with mathematical physics and low-dimensional  topology will be investigated.       John von Neumann introduced his algebras of operators on a Hilbert  space to study a variety of mathematical structures, some of which  arise naturally in theoretical physics.  In the early 80's, Vaughan  Jones initiated a Galois theory for inclusions of certain von Neumann  algebras and discovered that these inclusions are extremely  rigid.  They turn out to have a surprising braid group symmetry, which  led Jones to the discovery of his famous knot invariant, the Jones  polynomial.  Besides these profound connections of the theory  of  subfactors to knot theory and low-dimensional topology, there are also  deep relations to statistical mechanics, conformal field theory, and  algebraic quantum field theory that have been beneficial to the  understanding of naturally occurring structures in these areas.  ***",
