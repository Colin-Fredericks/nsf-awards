The research will be conducted in cooperation  with experts from the Harbin University, PRC, and the  objectives of the project are:  to conduct both theoretical  and experimental studies for the design of various passive  energy dissipation systems based on control theories for  seismic- and wind- excited structures; to carry out  theoretical and experimental studies for the development of  a new semi-active protective system, referred to as the semi-  active hydraulic momentum damper system (SAHMDS); and to  install and test a passive hydraulic momentum damper system  (HMDS) in a full scale building in South West China.  The  first two tasks will be carried out mainly at Irvine and the  last in PRC with both groups working together.  The benefit  of this arrangement is that during the last decade some  passive control systems for seismically excited civil  structures have been installed and studies by Chinese  experts who can share their experiences with the American  counterpart.  These systems will be tested for seismic and  wind hazards mitigation.  ***",
