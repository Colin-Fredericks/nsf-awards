 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9622250  PI:  Gong           The ASH algebras (or AH algebras, respectively)  are the C*-algebras      arising as   inductive limits of direct sums of subalgebras (or corner      subalgebras, respectively)  of matrix algebras over commutative      C*-algebras. These  algebras play an essential  role in the Elliott       program for the classification of separable amenable  C*-algebras. The       investigators propose to construct  ASH (or AH) inductive limit      decompositions for C*-algebras with certain general properties --- and,     in particular, to prove the conjecture that any simple separable amenable      C*-algebra of real rank zero and stable rank one is an AH algebra. They      also propose to classify  arbitrary simple ASH algebras in terms of the      K-theory and tracial state space invariants (used, in special cases, by     Elliott and others including the investigators).               The passage from a finite to an infinite number of degrees of freedom      in quantum physics led to the mathematical  theory of certain infinite      dimensional algebras, called operator algebras. A complete enumeration (or     classification) of a special class of operator algebras, called (amenable)      von Neumann algebras, was eiven by A. Connes  in his    Fields Medal winning      work of 1975. (The Fields Medal is the equivalent  of the  Nobel Prize in      mathematics.) More recently,  V. F. R. Jones  has applied the theory of     von Neumann algebras to study  ordinary knots.  This work, which also won     a Fields Medal, has shed light on quantum physics, and on the structure of     DNA. The investigators propose to work on a complete enumeration (or      classification) of another important class of operator algebras, called      amenable C*-algebras. The successful classification of such C*-algebras      will be essential  for us to understand the infinite dimensional world of     quantum physics.",
