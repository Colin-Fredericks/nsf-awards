 "awd_abstract_narration": "The national attrition rates in first-year calculus courses continue to be very high. This problem is exacerbated by the declining skills of high school graduates in algebraic manipulation and trigonometry.   The use of small classes (30-35 students) makes it possible to assess individual needs better and respond accordingly. The introduction of technology in many of these classes further provides students with support mechanisms for their limited skills in algebra and trigonometry. The ease in graphing and the use of computer algebra systems encourages students to address many of their own questions.   Entering students, in most cases, have a considerable familiarity with the use of computers and have grown up with computer games and their interactive approach to `problem solving.` This project harnesses that approach by extending the present symbolic algebra system capabilities to a broader use of multimedia in the classroom and the student laboratories. The incorporation of sound, video, and animation can provide a richer, more dynamic learning environment for students. To this end educational authoring softwares, Authorware and Director, are being used to create interactive multimedia presentations illustrating many of the major concepts of calculus and differential equations for classroom demonstration and as introductions to each of the laboratory projects involving Mathematica. This will substantially enhance the Mathematica laboratory projects that have been developed over the past 6 years.",
