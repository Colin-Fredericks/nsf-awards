 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a data management system to support a  variety of data of importance to molecular biologists interested  in groups of related proteins. The system will be distributed by  the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) as part of an existing  biological data resource supporting, among other things, data on  the protein kinase family of enzymes  (http://www.sdsc.edu/kinases) and temporal 3-dimensional  structure data derived using X-ray crystallography. The system  will permit queries integrating sequence homology, structure  homology, function, and disease in a way not possible with the  current generation of molecular biology resources. The overall  goal is to provide to the community a non-proprietary system that  is efficient, extensible and, for the molecular biologist, simple  to use for loading their own data.  These data could be subsets  of data available from existing sources and/or their own private  data. The system, will be coded in Java (or language of  equivalent functionality), will run on a local computer or in a  client-server environment using a local area network or the  Internet.    Specific deliverable are: (I) compact binary data storage, object  oriented in-memory representation of macromolecular features, and  query methodology suitable for analyzing comparative features  found in proteins. This is an extension of technology already  found in the software WPDB  (http://www.sdsc.edu/CCMS/Packages/wpdb.html) and MOOSE  (http://www.sdsc.edu/moose). (II) A client-server environment  which is beyond the current stateless access provided by the  World Wide Web. (III) Porting of existing methods written in C++  to Java and the creation of new methods providing an applet  library for use in molecular biology. (IV) A low-level graphics  library written in Java specifically for use in molecular  biology. (V) A molecular biology viewer (i.e., a domain-specific  browser, editor and interpreter). This viewer will be built from  the graphics library and provide th e features of the current  generalized stateless browsers, but also respond to specific  types of data and methods peculiar to molecular biology. The  interoperability between display objects, used successfully in  other software packages (WPDB and PDBtool,  http://www.cse.ogi.edu/DlSC/PDBTool/) will provide the  appropriate level of intuitive interaction.    The proposed data management system addresses limitations  perceived in the current generation of World Wide Web-based  servers supporting molecular biology and many other disciplines.  Notable limitations are: (i) the difficulty of keeping servers  current; (ii) the information content is broad but not deep;  (iii) tools for visualizing results of Web-based query are  limited and hampered by the stateless nature of the interaction  and the disproportional utilization of computing resources  between client and server; (iv) tools for the Web-based  comparative analysis of proteins could be expanded; (v) there are  few generic tools for the molecular biologist to use in building  and maintaining this type of resource for either local or global  use.",
