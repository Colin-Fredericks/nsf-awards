The PIs  will conduct a two-year limnological study of  warm monomictic and warm polymictic lakes in  Nepal located in differing land-use regimes.  Seasonal variability in trophic state, ionic  salinity, nutrient limitation, phytoplankton  composition and biomass, and algal toxins will  be measured.  The attributes of cyanobacteria  will be related to limnological features to  determine seasonal patterns.  This research  will advance our understanding of how the  monsoon climate influences lakes and will  contribute to the modest data base on lake  seasonality in Nepal.   Scope:  This project will be conducted under a  Momorandum of Understanding between the MU and  the IUCN-Nepal which is leading a national  effort for conservation and management of  wetlands.  Included is a reconnaissance survey  of water chemistry, fauna and flora, and an  electronic database of wetlands throughout the  country.  The IUCN will share costs for field  collections, MU will process water samples for  data on water quality and algal toxins.  The  research findings will be jointly published.          ***                                                                         Pakistan and is the next step in developing a  relationship between scientists who are doing  research in this field.  s area of research.   ngoing relationship in the exchange of  information foin developing .  The  International Conference on Non-Accelerator  Particle Physics will convene in Bangalore,  India from January 2-9, 1994.  Gaurang B. Yodh,  University of California, Irvine and R. Cowsik,  Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and  Director, Ind ian Institute of Astrophysics,  Bangalore are the organizers.  This conference  is dedicated to the discussion of the  fundamental physics that emerges from diverse  areas of non-accelerator particle physics such  as: Solar Neutrino Astronomy, Cosmic Rays,  Particle Physics, Neutrino Physics and the  Detection of Dark Matter.  Substantial progress  has been made in these fields during the past  five years and it is widely thought that  definitive answers to several questions of  Physics beyond the Standard Model can now come  from Non-Accelerator methods of inquiry.  The  conferees will review recent developments in  the various aspects of Particle Physics, their  implications in astrophysical situations,  experimental detection of dark matter,  theoretical interpretation and empirical and  physical models of the large scale structure of  the Universe.     Scope:  This conference will precede a major  interdisciplinary research program between the  Indian Institute of Astrophysics and the  University of California, Irvine.  As  considerable research is going on in the US in  all fields to be discussed at this conference,  it will be important for the US researchers to  present their work to an international body of  some of the most   respected scientists from all over the world.    ***",
