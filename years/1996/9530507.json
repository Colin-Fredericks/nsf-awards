 "awd_abstract_narration": "9530507  ABBOTT  This research project is part of the US Joint Global Ocean  Flux Study (JGOFS) Southern Ocean Program aimed at (1) a  better understanding of the fluxes of carbon, both organic  and inorganic, in the Southern Ocean, (2) identifying the  physical, ecological and biogeochemical factors and  processes which regulate the magnitude and variability of  these fluxes, and (3) placing these fluxes into the context  of the contemporary global carbon cycle.    The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) provides a pathway  between the major basins of the Pacific, Atlantic, and  Indian Oceans.  Therefore, it plays a critical role in the  global redistribution of salt, heat, and other ocean  properties between these basins.  Although improved  observations and more powerful numerical models have  identified many critical processes, it is still not possible  to balance all of the terms.  The scarcity of direct  observations has greatly hampered our understanding of the  physical environment, and the situation with regard to ocean  biogeochemistry is even worse.  The challenge to  understanding Southern Ocean dynamics (both physics and  biogeochemistry) is exacerbated by the strong dynamical link  between mesoscale processes and large-scale processes. The  dynamical scales approach the scales typical of energetic  coastal systems.  Yet the size of the Southern Ocean and its  impacts on global biogeochemistry and climate make this an  important region.    This research starts with the hypothesis that the ecosystem  of the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone (APFZ) behaves much like  a coastal upwelling system which is characterized by  episodic diatom blooms.  These blooms result in high  f-ratios, high preservation rates of biogenic silica and  relatively little vertical flux of particulate biogenic  material.  These processes are consistent with observations  of bottom sediments.  The lack of meridional barriers leads  to a \"recirculation\" of diatoms associated with frontal  meanders.  Phytoplankton wou ld alternately upwell and then  downwell in these meanders, creating a helical circulation  path.  Such bloom events may be unimportant in the total  productivity of the system but play a disproportionate role  in carbon fluxes.    In this project a high-resolution sampling array of moorings  with bio-optical sensors and current meters will be  deployed.  The moorings will rely on low-cost components so  that the sampling scales will match with the dynamical  scales of the critical processes at the Polar Front.  Lagrangian drifters (some equipped with bio-optical sensors)  will be deployed during high-resolution surveys in order to  characterize the temporal and spatial scales of variability  when coupled with the Eulerian observations from the  moorings.  These data will be analyzed in conjunction with  high-resolution SeaSoar surveys and high temporal resolution  sediment traps proposed by other investigators to study the  effects of mesoscale processes on productivity and  horizontal and vertical fluxes of biological properties.",
