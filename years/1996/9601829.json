 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to acquire instrumentation needed to facilitate  genomics research on  the Purdue University campus. Purdue University has undertaken several  important initiatives over the past 7 years that have provided  substantial strength to genetics research. These include the  construction and renovation of significant laboratory space,  establishment of an interdisciplinary graduate training program in  genetics, and the hiring of several genetics faculty with expertise  spanning a broad and exciting range of topics. This growing momentum  has now appropriately positioned Purdue University for the  establishment of the Purdue Genomics Laboratory (PGL). Such a  laboratory, once equipped for high throughput genomics data generation  and analysis, will serve three important objectives: To support  genomics research efforts of 8 primary users, to serve as a student  training facility in support of a NSF-sponsored graduate training  effort in plant genetics, and to facilitate collaborative linkages for  the application of DNA-based methodologies to plant improvement. The  instrumentation needed to meet these objectives includes an electronic  autoradiography system, an automated DNA sequencing system with  molecular biology labstation, a gel documentation system, CHEF mapping  systems, thermocyclers, -80C freezer equipment, and plant growth  chamber facilities. This equipment, once in place, would allow the  initiation of several large-scale genomics research projects in  important plant and fimgal genomes that, to date, have not been  well-characterized. At present, the lack of these facilities on the  Purdue campus are all that stand in the way of these valuable research  endeavors.",
