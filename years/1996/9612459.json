 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612459  Robin    Robin, a retired chemist from A.T.& T. Laboratories, has served as  a volunteer at Science High School, a small, public magnet school  in a large urban city, Newark, N.J. since 1991. His accomplishments  include:    I.   Establishment of the Student Independent Research Program,       which engages interested students in the pursuit of long-term       science research projects and encourages them to enter state       and national competitions such as the New Jersey Science Fair,       Rutgers University Junior Science Symposium, NAACP ACTSO,       National Black Chemist and Chemical Engineers Science Bowl;    II.  Secures grants to maintain the program, which is not       maintained by the school district -- project SEED, an American       Chemical Society grant, and A.T.& T. Minority Grants program;      III. Directs his own funds into the program;      IV.  Spends countless hours coaching, mentoring, and acquiring       materials and equipment for urban schools that serve primarily       Black and Hispanic students; and      V.   Of the 21 students participating since 1992, 18 are       underrepresented students (15 Black or Hispanic and three       white females).  All have received awards for their       achievement, including one Westinghouse semi-finalist, and a       four-year scholarship to Stevens Institute of Technology for       another.  Students attend other schools such as M.I.T.,       Dartmouth, Bates, and Rutgers University.    As a retiree from industry, Robin was recommended for this award on  the basis of the quality and outcomes of his work with  underrepresented minorities in science and mathematics.",
