 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522301  Cypher  MIMD (Multiple-Instruction-Stream, Multiple-Data-Stream) parallel  computers are naturally asychronous.  Many MIMD computers use a  separate clock for each processor in order to avoid clock skew  problems.  Furthermore, even if all the processors use a common  clock, the timing of commulication events is not known in advance  due to factors such as data dependent processing times, processor  interrupts and variable network congestion.  This asynchrony has  a major impact on the design of the machine's communication sub-  system the semantics of the programming model, and the creation  of parallel algorithms.  This research studies principles for the  design and use of asynchronous parallel computers.    Specifically, three key areas of asynchronous parallel computing  are studied.         1. specifying the semantics of message-passing, shared  memory, and other, novel, programming models.         2. Creating efficient communication protocols that implement  the above programming models, and         3. evaluating metrics and models for the design of  algorithms for asynchronous parallel computers.    This research will result in more efficient communication in MIMD  machines, novel techniques for reasoning about and using  asynchronous parallel computers, and a better understanding of  how the theoretical community's body of knowledge in parallel  algorithms can be applied to real machines.  ***",
