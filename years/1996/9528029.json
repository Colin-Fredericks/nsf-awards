 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, in the Organic Dynamics Program of the Chemistry Division,   will allow Prof. Piotr Kaszynski of Vanderbilt University to synthesize   and investigate liquid crystals which have the unusual feature of also   being stable free radicals.  This leads to the ability to `tune`   electrical and magnetic properties either by controlling the nature of   the liquid crystal by structural variation or by controlling the nature   of the free radical.  The structures to be studied are based on the   thioaminyl radical fragment.  Computational methods for prediction of   properties are used in the selection of specific preparative targets and   in refinement of such choices. Both the ultimate target  materials and   the model non-liquid crystal free radicals, prepared in the course of   developing synthetic methodology,  will be studied electrochemically, by   epr, and by X-ray spectroscopy when appropriate. It is intended that new   materials with unusual electrical and magnetic properties will result.  This work involves the preparation of new materials in which two   attractive structural features are combined. Liquid crystalline molecules   respond to small electrical signals and to temperature variation and are   used as displays, thermosensors, and otherwise. Stable free radicals   possess unusual electrical and magnetic properties intrinsically.  This   work combines them to produce, characterize, and study a unique class of   substances, and perhaps ultimately to develop novel devices containing   them.",
