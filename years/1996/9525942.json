 "awd_abstract_narration": "9525942  Cahay  This is a collaborative research effort between University of Cincinnati and Hughes Research Laboratory to enhance the performance of  InP-based PNP Heterojunction component of the research will consist of establishing and developing an approaches, the first based on use of a drift-diffusion model using a commercial numerical simulator, and the second based on the development of an Ensemble Monte Carlo simulator which includes the effects of hole tunneling at the emitter-base junction and the effects of  band-mixing between heavy and light holes throughout the device.  Subsequently, the two approaches will be coupled to provide a comprehensive model of device operation.  Furthermore, the  thermophysics of device self-heating will be investigated through a   self-consistent solution of the equations describing heat flow through the structure and the physics of charge generation and flow during device operation.  To assure the accuracy of the device models, comparison of the device electrical characteristics and high frequency performance will be made with detailed measurements on devices fabricated in the laboratory and with results reported on commercially fabricated devices.  In collaboration with this effort the industrial partner Hughes Research Laboratory, will provide the starting multi-layer epitaxial substrates from which the PNP HBT devices will be fabricated and will provide technical guidance in the development of the HBT's fabrication process.  ***",
