 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to upgrade the technology used in the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) program. In 1994, the university purchased three Sun Microsystem Sparcstations and ARC/INFO software. The U.S. Forest Service loaned a pen plotter to the university to supplement the project. Although the memory has been doubled recently to 32 megabytes, student projects involving large databases still prove to be a frustrating experience. Large databases are difficult to manipulate because of limited memory. When the existing plotter is returned to the Forest Service, the students would not be able to view completed work except on a computer monitor. The limitations of existing technology would negatively affect the potential of the GIS program. Therefore, the funds for this project are being devoted to the purchase of a Hewlett-Packard 650C plotter and to increase the RAM on each workstation to 96 megabytes. This equipment helps provide students with real-world projects based on local and regional needs and interests.",
