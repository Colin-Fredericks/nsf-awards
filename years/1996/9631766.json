 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the important role that sunk costs potentially play in  explaining market structure and firm performance there is  relatively little empirical evidence on their magnitude, how they  vary across different products or across different types of  firms, and whether they are useful in explaining the persistent  heterogeneity in firm performance within markets.  The purpose of  this research is to estimate the magnitude of sunk entry and exit  costs for a number of U.S. manufactured products and test if they  are an important determinant of firm turnover and performance  patterns.     This project will utilize data from the U.S. Census of  Manufactures for the period 1963-1992 to study the entry and exit  process for a number of products that are sold in relatively  small geographic markets.  The substantial movements in  population across geographic areas over this 30 year period have  produced changes in the structure of local markets as firms have  entered and exited in response to these changing demand patterns.  The first part of this project will measure entry and exit rates  across geographic markets and use these turnover patterns to  estimate the magnitude of sunk entry and exit costs faced by  firms in specific product markets.  The work will recognize that  there are different types of entrants, including new firms and  those diversifying from other product and geographic markets, and  that firms can enter through several channels, including  constructing new plants or altering the product mix of their  existing production facilities. Each of these types and methods  of entry is likely to involve very different levels of sunk  investments and thus lead to different firm turnover rates.  By  estimating sunk costs that vary by type of firm and method of  entry, it should be possible to determine if sunk costs are a  significant factor generating the differences in turnover  patterns and firm lifetimes.    The second part of the project will utilize the estimated  patterns of sunk cost s across products and entry types to  determine if sunk costs contribute to the amount of producer  heterogeneity observed within different product markets.   Predictions will be tested about the relationships among sunk  costs, turnover, and the level and persistence of firm  heterogeneity that are derived from recent theoretical models of  industry evolution.  The Census of Manufactures data are also  uniquely suited to this endeavor because they allow the  characterization of the amount of heterogeneity among the entire  set of producers in a market.",
