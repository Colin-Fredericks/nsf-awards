 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the purchase of equipment to implement investigative laboratories in Cell Biology, the first course for biology majors. The project moves laboratory science teaching in the introductory course away from a highly structured format toward investigation and exploration. Students, working in pairs, develop technical and analytical competence through projects they have planned in consultation with their instructors. Students are able to design experiments, think critically about their work, read and understand primary literature related to their work, and publicly present and discuss their work. The Cell Biology laboratory experience can result in enthusiasm and expectation for more challenging investigative work in upper-division courses employing cellular and molecular approaches, including Microbiology, Developmental Biology, and Molecular Biology. Comprehensive program evaluation will include assessment of the work of students in upper-division courses and independent projects, as well as compilation of information from graduates, employers, and mentors concerning the effectiveness of the investigative approach with respect to subsequent employment or education.",
