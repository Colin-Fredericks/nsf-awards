 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a major technique for elucidation of the structure of organic compounds. Until now, students in the undergraduate organic classes were not able to get more than a glimpse of this methodology because of the lack of an NMR instrument of reasonable capability. The project involves purchase of an NMR instrument capable of proton decoupling, with a variable temperature probe. A spiral teaching approach introduces students to NMR techniques early in the semester and then uses the methodology throughout the year. Understanding the structure of the organic compounds is central to a good understanding of the reactivities and properties of the molecules. The curriculum provides a strong correlation between the structural features discussed in the classroom and the methodology that enables one to see it experimentally, and it enables students to learn by discovery. Students gather data on problems, then think them through to reach meaningful conclusions. This pedagogy rivets student interest in lab activities and helps them develop higher-order thinking skills, as well as analytical skills. Relating spin-spin splitting parameters to the structure of organic molecules and studying temperature and concentration effects on NMR spectra of compounds are primarily used. Open-ended lab projects assess the skills developed by the students.   This project, with its use of NMR as a foundation for discovery-based learning, serves as a model for other undergraduate organic programs, providing a curriculum that balances creativity and structure in discovery-type labs. Projects and examples that work well in such a format can be fine-tuned. Specific discovery-based learning methods can be developed for dissemination in publications such as the Journal of Chemical Education and at educational conferences sponsored by the American Chemical Society.",
