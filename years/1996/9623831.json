That is, systems half as large or twice as large behave  identically when normalized by the mass. This is not the  case in situations where the spatial dimensions are made so  small that they become comparable to a relevant length of  the system. In the case of a second-order phase transition,  one has a length scale which diverges as the transition is  approached. In this case, if one limits this divergence by  an imposed spatial boundary, one affects the behavior in a  fundamental way. This situation will be studied in the case  of helium at the superfluid transition. To do this work one  must have a way of achieving uniform confinement. It has  been shown that two silicon wafers can be spaced in such a  way as to achieve uniform sub-micrometer confinement over  large lateral dimensions. These structures can be used for  the proposed studies and have, as well, technological  importance. The bonding process, for instance, can be used  to achieve large-scale silicon-on-insulator structures..  %%%  Present semiconductor technology has pushed the integration  of active electronics to very small dimensions. It is  technologically challenging and important to push these  limits further, and scientifically to ask the question  whether the ever-smaller systems will behave simply as  smaller versions of the larger system. A similar question  can be asked in other circumstances where the influence of  the smaller dimensions can be effectively amplified. To  perform such studies one has to make small structures in a  reliable way, and develop new measuring techniques. The  structures which will be made for this work will consist of  two wafers of silicon bonded to each other in such a way  that a very small gap remains. In this gap a liquid will be  introduced and its properties as it undergoes a phase  transformation will be studied. The overall results of these  s tudies will have technological  implications for the silicon-bonding process, and will lead  to a better understanding of the behavior of very small  systems.  ***",
