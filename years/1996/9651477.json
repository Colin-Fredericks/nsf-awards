 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this project are to improve the quality of physics instruction at this institution by enhancing and updating the laboratory equipment and curricula; to increase enrollment and retention of students in mathematics- and science-related programs of study; and to increase the enrollment of women, minorities, and undeclared majors in careers in science by providing resources to aid in the instruction and application of knowledge.    The department is using microcomputer-based laboratory experiments in data acquisition, analysis, and presentation in undergraduate physics and physical science laboratories in the areas of mechanics, heat and thermodynamics, electrical and magnetism, and optics. Microcomputer-based laboratory experiments are being designed to enable students to gain hands-on experience with new technology while reinforcing traditional instructional methods. These enhanced laboratory experiences provide students with effective learning to support lecture theory. In addition to increasing learning, exposure to current laboratory instrumentation and technology makes students more competitive upon transfer to a senior institution or entrance into the workforce. Previously, there had been no classes in the curricula of Elementary Education, Pre-Professional Engineering, or Science in which students experience this type of computer utilization.    The project supports seven microcomputer workstations equipped with seven computers, appropriate software, and supplementary laboratory equipment. This configuration supports all of the redesigned and newly developed laboratory experiments. Up to 102 students enrolled in Physics and Physical Science courses may benefit and be better prepared for the technologies of the 21st century.",
