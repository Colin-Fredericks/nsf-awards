 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this workshop is to present both a course and  develop a problem workbook supporting undergraduate instruction in  these critical and wide ranging areas.  Offering such a course to  20 undergraduate teaching faculty and involving them in development  of supporting teaching materials will significantly enhance their  understanding of current environmental management subjects and help  them update and develop new courses in this area.  Problems and  solutions generated by an interdisciplinary team of engineering and  applied science faculty invited to attend the workshop will form  the basis of the workbook generated from this effort.  Topics to be  included in the workbook are:  fundamentals, regulations, risk  assessment/risk communication, pollution prevention, sustainable  development, air/water/solid waste management, hazardous waste  management, indoor air pollution, environmental ethics,  environmental justice, ISO14000 and global environmental  management.  The first draft of the problem workbook will be  prepared during a two-week summer workshop at Utah State University  in June, 1996.  The 1996-1997 academic year will provide an  opportunity for participants to classroom test the effectiveness of  the teaching materials provided to them in the workshop, and the  problems contained in the workbook.  A three-day follow up summer  session in late June, 1997 is scheduled at Manhattan College to  provide an opportunity to revise, update, and edit the workbook,  and finalize production and distribution plans for implementation  in undergraduate engineering and applied science curricula.  This  project is proposed as a collaborative effort between universities  (Utah State University, Logan, Utah; Northern Arizona University,  Flagstaff, Arizona) and a four-year undergraduate college  (Manhattan College, Riverdale, New York).  The Program Director and  co-Directors have over 50 combined years of experience in  environmental management, have been successfully involved in NSF  U ndergraduate Faculty Enhancement projects in the past, and are  involved in minority and Native American retention and training  efforts at their institutions.",
