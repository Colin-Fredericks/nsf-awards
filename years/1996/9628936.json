 "awd_abstract_narration": "9628936  Shiflet    This is a fundamental examination of pearlite formation in  iron-carbon steels.  Pearlite is a lamellar product of  eutectoid decomposition and is one of the most familiar of  all metallographic structures.  It can form in steels and  also in a range of non-ferrous alloys during transformation  under isothermal, continuous cooling and forced-velocity  growth conditions.  The aim of this project is to extend  crystallographic concepts concerning the growth of pearlite  and examine the role of ternary substitutional alloying  elements in pearlite development.  Key questions addressed:  Is the alloying element atomic diffusion path at the  pearlitic cementite/austenite or pearlitic ferrite/austenite  interphase boundaries.  Are these boundaries really the  rapid diffusion paths they are perceived to be?  How does  the partitioning of substitutional elements affect pearlite  development?  Extensive thermodynamic calculations are  performed and correlated with experimental observations as  to element partitioning and lamellae development.  The  primary experimental approach includes making all ternary  steel alloys in-house and performing heat treatments  isothermally in lead baths.  Examination of the structure is  by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy.  Chemical partitioning studies are performed in a Field  Emission Gun transmission electron microscope that is  capable of collecting chemical data from areas less than 1  nanometer in diameter.  %%%  Substitutional alloying elements are important in steel  production because they can greatly increase the  hardenability of the alloy, in part, by delaying the  pearlite reaction which leads to a greater ability to  produce martensite.  Also, small additions of elements that  are strong carbide formers, such as vanadium and titanium,  can lead to ultra-high strength pearlite structures in  medium carbon steel alloys through precipitation hardening  the ferrite lamellae with parallel sheets of carbides  roughly 10 nanome ters apart.  ***",
