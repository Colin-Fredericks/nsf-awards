These mutants, called root meristemless (rml), are impaired in the ability to initiate and maintain cell division in the root apex, resulting in meristemless roots of 1-2 mm in length. Complementation analysis has identified two RML genes, RML1 and RML2, which are mapped to chromosome four and three, respectively. Although rml1 mutants produce normal embryonic roots, root apical cells undergo no, or limited, cell division after germination. rml1 mutants are able to initiate lateral and adventitious roots, However, these roots also arrest  cell division once the size of the embryonic root is reached. It is hypothesized that the two wild type RML genes are involved in the signal transduction pathway mediating cell proliferation at the root tip. To test this hypothesis, Dr. Sung will identify and clone the genes involved in root apical cell proliferation. The RML1 gene will be cloned first to develop a molecular probe for studying the temporal and spatial expr ession of the RML1 gene in the wild type and mutant plants. The phenotype of the 35S:RML1 transgenic plants will be characterized to seek evidence supporting the proposed role of the RML1 gene. The long term goal is to understand the principles and mechanisms of localized cell proliferation in plants. ***                         ;                                                         Oh     +'  0                                       $       H       l                                               D       h                                     S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   %                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       9513522                             eozsaruh                            eozsaruh                    @    M                              @                                   @    M                                                                                                      @    F #                                    Microsoft Word 6.0                                                      2                                                                                       ;                               ;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          e =       e                                                                               j       j   j       j       j       j       j                                                                       H   1                                                                                                                   *       y   T       +   H                       j                                                                         H               j       j                                                                       j               j                                       ~               j       j       j       j                           B                                                                                                   9513522 Sung  The proposed research will use a set of Arabidopsis root mutants to characterize the genes necessary for continuous root growth.
