 "awd_abstract_narration": "9624021  Anlage    The objectives are: to understand the basic nature of the  superconductor (SC) proximity effect, use this understanding  to engineer qualitatively new SC materials, and study the  physics of cuprate Scs through their microwave surface  impedance (MSI). Both low-Tc and high-Tc SC materials, in  both thin-film and bulk form, will be prepared and  characterized. The MSI will be measured by two resonance  techniques developed by the group. The research should lead  to our deeper understanding  of low-Tc superconductivity,  the symmetry of the ground-state wavefunction of cuprate  Scs,  the influence of fluctuations on the physical  properties of cuprates, and a clarification of the physical  properties of the rogue electron-doped cuprate SC, as well  as some novel applications of superconductors.    %%%    Superconductivity is one of the many intriguing phenomena  that have come to light as scientists have explored the  realm of very low temperatures.And one of the most  astonishing features has been the \"proximity effect\"  whereby a superconductor can sometimes induce  superconductivity in a nearby normal material. In this  program, we shall conduct experiments designed to deepen our  understanding of this effect and of superconductivity in  general, and to engineer qualitatively new superconducting  materials.  ***",
