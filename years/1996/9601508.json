Sridhar  U of Puerto Rico Mayaguez    ABSTRACT     This project is concerned with the use of software like ASPEN PLUS, GAMS and ASCEND for the development of undergraduate design projects for students.  The department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Puerto Rico has over 500 undergraduate students.  It is imperative that the students receive a modern computer-aided education that will enable them to use and interpret the results from the software available and prepare them for the design of processes and process equipment.  As a large majority of our students go to work in the chemical industry, such exposure to using software like ASPEN PLUS will be a tremendous asset for them.  At this time, the department suffers from lack of modern computational equipment like work-stations.  This project will provide the students with exposure to chemical engineering software like ASPEN PLUS, ASCEND and GAMS.  Two work stations will be hooked up to the personal computers.  The primary objective is to enable students to use the software and participate in the various computer aided design projects.  This project will provide a new, modern and a computer aided process design instruction and enable students to be better prepared for the rapidly developing automation in the chemical process industry.",
