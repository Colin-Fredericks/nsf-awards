 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is developing a metapattern-based discovery loop for integrated data mining. Metapatterns (also known as metaqueries) are second-order, declarative expressions that  specify the types of patterns to be discovered and assist humans in focusing on more fruitful search directions. The discovery loop is a search engine that integrates deduction, induction, and external guidance from humans, as well as internal guidance of inter-component dependencies. Given a completely new database, the system first generates an initial set of the most general metapatterns based on the meta-information of the database, and then executes these metapatterns against the database to discover actual patterns. Based on the results, new metapatterns are dynamically generated by adding more constraints to the more plausible metapatterns. In this iterative process, human discovers can analyze, create, select, and execute metapatterns, or instruct the system to pursue metapatterns on its own.  This ability not only makes the process of data mining more efficient and productive (the more expert users can use the system for inspiration of better metapatterns, and the less expert users can learn how to perform data mining in a particular domain by observation), but also provides a new method for unsupervised learning of probabilistic, relation-based patterns.",
