 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor John Light of the University of Chicago is being supported by   the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program.  The project   involves the development of both new and improved mathematical and   computational methods for calculating and predicting quantum dynamical   processes.  The methods rely largely on the use of the discrete variable   representation of the potential as well as the development of methods   based on square integrable functions to molecular scattering.  The   applications include the prediction of the ro-vibrational spectra of   floppy molecular dimers such as the water dimer, several investigations   of resonances in reactive scattering and photodissociation as well as   applications in the area of molecule surface scattering.   The accurate determination of structure and dynamics of few atoms systems   is of great importance to understanding and modeling a number of   important processes such as absorption and emission of light, energy   transfer and chemical reactions.  This work continues the development and   application of accurate methods in chemical physics to the study of such   phenomena.  Chemical reactions both in the gas phase and on surfaces are   being successfully described by the use of increasingly sophisticated   mathematical models.  Several such models are being developed in this   theoretical study, thus aiding our understanding and control of a number   of processes such as combustion, catalysis, and the formation of   molecules and materials.",
