 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600876  Hasson  Caveolae, or \"little caves,\" are flask-shaped invaginations  of the plasma membrane that have been observed by electron  microscopy in many mammalian cell types.  They have been  postulated to mediate several cellular processes, including  transport across cells (transcytosis), uptake of small  molecules (potocytosis), and most recently, transmembrane  signal transduction.  The caveola is now viewed increasingly  as an organelle that plays a critical role in the  organization of communication within cells.  The long-term  goal of this project is the elucidation of the structure and  function of caveolae through crystallographic and genetic  studies of one of its protein components, caveolin.  During  the preliminary stage of the project, to be funded by this  Research Planning Grant, efforts will be concentrated on  obtaining diffraction-quality crystals of a soluble domain of  caveolin that mediates oligomerization and interaction with  G.  %%%  In order for a complex organism (such as a human being) to  exist, the cells that make it up must be able to communicate  with each other.  Each cell must be capable of receiving  instructions from its environment.  A cell receives many  kinds of messages and must choose between many possible  complex responses.  We are trying to understand how a normal  cell responds quickly and correctly to each message it  receives.  It seems that many of the messages transmitted  from outside to inside a cell are organized by caveolae,  \"little caves\" on the surface of cells.  Caveolae seem to act  like telephone switchboards, ensuring that each message is  received immediately by the correct protein target inside the  cell.  Using the technique of X-ray crystallography, we are  attempting to determine the structure of the protein  caveolin, one of the main components of caveolae, in order to  better understand how these switchboards operate.  ***",
