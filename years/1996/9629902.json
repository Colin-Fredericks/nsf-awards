 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Schmidt - 962992    Partial oxidation of alkanes to produce chemicals in single step monolith reactors at very short contact times promises to open new routes to chemical synthesis.  The PI plans a systematic examination of these processes in an effort to produce oxygen-containing organic molecules by direct oxidation of small alkanes to form products such as aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, and acids.  This will involve oxide catalysts on low area monolith supports in high temperature reactor configurations with rapid ignition, complete reaction, and rapid quenching to minimize unwanted homogeneous reactions and decomposition of intermediates.    Two projects will involve (1) the use of oxide catalysts in short contact time, high temperature partial oxidation reactions for times less than 20 milliseconds and temperatures above 6000C and (2) microsecond reactors in which rapid heating and rapid quenching are exploited to optimize heterogeneous-homogeneous partial oxidation processes in times much less than one millisecond.  Particular topics to be explored are (1) use of higher alkanes, other oxidants, and ammoxidation, (2) use of stratified monoliths with reactant injection and interstage cooling or heating, (3) exploitation of very high and sonic flow effects, and (4) further investigation of fluidized bed reactors.    The PI will search for new catalyst systems and reactor geometries which can be operated in a stable state under these conditions and thus produce nonequilibrium selectivities to particular products at high conversions.  The mechanisms and optimization of these processes will also be explored through extensive simulations of reactions, mass transfer, heat transfer, and fluid flow effects.",
