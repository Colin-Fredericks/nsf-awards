Events during this  period, which extends from before the final breakup of Gondwana  through the onset of Antarctic glaciation, are ill-defined by  existing data.  The Cape Roberts Project (CRP) aims to provide  new data about the development of the West Antarctic rift system,  the subsidence history of the Ross Sea, and ice sheet  fluctuations on Antarctica through this critical time interval.  These regional events must be documented better because they have  ramifications of regional and global significance, including: 1)  impacts on both regional and global climatic development, with  its terrestrial and marine effects, and 2) impacts on the  preservation of such climatic records through the regional and  global influences of Gondwana tectonics.    CRP is partly an extension of previous drilling efforts on the  Antarctic continental margin, and is partly a new initiative to  more completely document the developmental history of the Ross  Sea sector of the Antarctic and southern Pacific region through  the late Cretaceous - early Cenozoic.  It will draw on the  successes of previous drilling efforts to document regional and  environmental development with good spatial and temporal  resolution, and it will also draw upon newly compiled geophysical  data bases.    CRP is a collaborative endeavor and is currently being supported  by six participating countries.  This award supports the U.S.  contribution to the stratigraphic logging and initial  sedimentological characterization of the drill core.  Pursuit of  more specific research goals will be accomplished via proposals  from individual scientists in the future.    Tasks involved in the proposed work will include initial  description and characterizatio n of the stratigraphic  successions; these results will be used as the fundamental data  base for other analyses.  The stratigraphic sections will also be  used as reference sections for modeling observed marine and  geophysical events.  Initial sedimentological characterization of  the successions will allow the definition of facies, the  construction of facies sequences, and the interpretation of  depositional environments through time.  The end result of the  proposed work will be an Ocean Drilling Program-style initial  report for each drilling season.  These reports will include the  stratigraphic log, initial facies and depositional system  interpretations, sedimentary petrologic and petrogenetic  analyses, and initial clay mineralogical analysis.  Information  provided by other specialists will also be included in the  reports, including biostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy,  geophysical logs and geochemical interpretations.  The initial  interpretations of regional history will be presented in these  reports, and the regional and global ramifications of this  history will be highlighted.",
