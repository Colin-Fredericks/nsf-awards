 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Alan Kolata, Mr. Matthew Seddon will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct archaeological excavations at the `temple to the sun` which is located on an island in highland Bolivian lake. Spanish explorers who observed and described the Inca empire noted that this was a highly sacred site. Previous archaeological work has determined the location and has also discovered that the area was inhabited during at least two previous cultural periods. Mr. Seddon will excavate to determine the extent and nature of these earlier occupations. Both architectural and artifactural data will be recovered for comparison with other sites from the same time periods in the Bolivian highlands. On this basis it will be possible to learn whether during these earlier periods the area served a religious function or whether is was occupied for primarily domestic use.  Archaeologists wish to understand the processes which led the emergence of complex societies and have extensively studied the Inca as an example of a New World pre Columbian civilization. However in the Andean region the Incas were only the latest in a series of such complex entities and Bolivia is known for the Tiwanaku society which preceded it. The extent to which the Inca created their civilization `de novo` is not known and Mr. Seddon's research will address this issue. Although the temple of the sun served a religious purpose, Mr. Seddon's work focuses not on religion but on social and political control. In many prehistoric societies these functions are embedded in a ritual framework and it is these underlying social processes which are the object of Mr. Seddon's research.  This work is important for several reasons. It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists. It will shed new light on the growth of complex societies and assist in the training of a promising young scientist.",
