 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made jointly by the Office of Special Projects in the   Chemistry Division and by the Division of Materials Research in support   of the computational studies of Dr. David Yaron. Semi-empirical quantum   chemistry models will be developed and applied to the photophysics of   conjugated polymers. Simultaneous fits will be developed based on   experimental data on oligomers and polymers and on different polymeric   systems to provide for the investigation of the operative screening   mechanisms. By developing a single consistent approach for   polyacetylenes, polydiacetylenes and poly(paraphenylenevinylene),   parameters will be developed that can be applied to other polymers.   Coulomb screening between electrons and holes in excited states will be   included through explicit calculations of the polarization induced in   surrounding polymer chains, and through explicit calculations of on-chain   screning mechanisms. Equation-of-motion formalisms developed for   nonlinear optics will be used to calculate excited states, providing a   size-consistent and computationally feasible approach to the excited   states of long polymer chains.  The major advantage of conjugated polymers over inorganic materials in   optical and electronic applications is the ability to control structure   at the molecular level by synthesis, and at the macromolecular level by   self-assembly. The development of semi-empirical models will allow for   the prediction of structure-property relationships in important classes   of materials and provide a basis for the design of new materials.",
