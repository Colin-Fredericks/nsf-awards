Ganz, Aura    University of Massachusetts-Amherst    Equipment for Real -Time System Protyping    The development of real-time embedded computing systems requires a combination of software simulation and hardware emulation to verify functionality and estimate performance, costs, power consumption and reliability.  The requested equipment is for the development of a generic approach to the prototyping  of real-time systems as well as specific hardware and software for applying this approach to ongoing research projects in Wireless Networks and Real-time Robotics.  The equipment consists of a small network of Personal Computers which run Computer Aided Design tools for software simulations as well as serving as hosts for hardware emulation systems based on microprocessors and digital signal processors.  Together , the entire system allows the rapid development, verification and analysis of systems which could not be explored by either simulation or emulation alone.  In particular, it allows the statistical study of data-dependent and environment-dependent properties which are difficult to model analytically and too slow using traditional software simulation.",
