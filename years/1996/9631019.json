 "awd_abstract_narration": "9631019  Storm    Interest in Solid State Chemistry has grown dramatically in  recent years, encouraged by both the recognition of the  technological importance and scientific challenges in the study  of new materials and the interest of students in what they feel  as a `relevant' area of science.  The advent of initiatives such  as the Advanced Materials Processing Program as a national thrust  in the synthesis and processing of new materials has put Solid  State Chemistry in the spotlight.  Funding is provided for  partial support of the 1996 Gordon Conference on Solid State  Chemistry to be held at Colby-Sawyer College, New London, NH  during July 14-19, 1996.  Invited speakers have been drawn from  research groups in academia and industry.  %%%  Solid-State Chemistry is a growing and dynamic field of study.  In addition to leading scientists from the U.S., world class  scientists from Britain and France have been included to make  contact with the broad international research effort in this  area.  The Gordon Research Conference Special Fund has provided  $15,000 towards the cost of speakers and discussion leaders for  the Solid State Chemistry Gordon Conference.  The NSF funds are  intended for the support of ten graduate students and young  faculty to give them the opportunity to meet and participate in  scientific discussions with the leaders in the field of Solid  State Chemistry.  ***",
