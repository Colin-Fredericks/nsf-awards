 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   program supports research by Dr. Alison Butler of the Chemistry   Department, University of California at Santa Barbara, on marine   haloperoxidase enzymes.  The reactivities of vanadium bromoperoxidase and   FeHeme bromoperoxidase, including their roles in biosynthesis,  will be   investigated using functional model complexes and enzyme studies.    Vanadium complexes of alpha-helical peptides and alpha-helical peptide   bundles that closely resemble vanadium haloperoxidases will be   synthesized and tested.  In addition some new mesoporous and titanium   dioxide materials will be prepared and tested for peroxidative   halogenation reactivity.  Reactivity comparisons will be made to marine   haloperoxides isolated from chiral halogenated acetogenins and   sesquiterpenes produced from marine algae.  The halide selectivity of   vanadium haloperoxidases from algae that evolve chlorinated and   brominated hydrocarbons will be investigated.  Many marine natural products and enzymes have important industrial   applications in the specialty chemical, diagnostics, pharmaceutical, and   biotechnology industries.   Development of the use of some of these   natural products has been inhibited by lack of availability of sufficient   quantities.  This work will identify functional mimics for some marine   haloperoxidases present in marine algae.  These compounds have potential   use as catalysts for production of oxidants and halogenating agents in   situ, processes that would be environmentally beneficial alternatives to   present technology.",
