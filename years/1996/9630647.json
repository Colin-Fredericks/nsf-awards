 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630647  Wolfe    To grow and divide, a cell must use the compounds that it consumes both to construct cellular components and to generate the energy required for that construction.  Often a cell will use the same compound for both purposes, funneling some of it into a biosynthetic pathway and some into an energy-producing pathway.  To survive, the cell must efficiently balance its biosynthetic and energetic needs.  To characterize the mechanisms used by cells to perform this physiological balancing act, the flow of carbon through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and the glyoxylate shunt (GS) has been studied.  Cells balance their interrelated biosynthetic and energetic needs by using exquisitely sensitive genetic and biochemical switches to control the metabolic fate of isocitrate.  When they need energy, cells funnel isocitrate through the TCA cycle; if they require biosynthetic components, they channel it through the GS.  Although the genetic switch has been investigated for years and some of its components are known, the underlying mechanism(s) of control remains a mystery.  We have evidence that, in the bacterium Escherichia coli, control of this switch coordinates with the synthesis of the enzyme acetyl-CoA synthetase (AcsA).  This project is designed to test the hypothesis that, under certain conditions, AcsA can switch on or induce the GS; once induced, the GS feeds back to turn off AcsA synthesis.  To determine how AcsA and the GS regulate the synthesis of each other, the following specific aims will be addressed:  (i) identify and characterize the mechanism(s) by which the GS controls the synthesis and/or activity of AcsA and (ii) identify and characterize the mechanism(s) by which AcsA controls the synthesis and/or activity of the GS.  %%%  To grow and divide, all cells must use the compounds that they consume both to construct cellular components and to generate the energy required for that construction.  Often cells will use the same compound for both purposes, funneling some of i t into a construction or biosynthetic pathway and some into an energy-producing pathway.  To survive, cells must efficiently balance their biosynthetic and energetic needs.  To identify and characterize the mechanisms used by cells to perform this fundamental physiological balancing act, the flow of carbon through two central metabolic pathways;  the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and the glyoxylate shunt (GS), has been studied.  Cells balance their conflicting biosynthetic and energetic needs by using exquisitely sensitive genetic and biochemical switches.  Although the genetic switch has been studied for years and many of its components are known, the underlying mechanism(s) of control remains a mystery.  We now have evidence that, at least in the bacterium Escherichia coli, control of this switch coordinates with the synthesis of an enzyme, called acetyl-CoA synthetase (AcsA), that generates the starting material for both the TCA cycle and the GS.  This project will investigate the relationship between this genetic switch and the synthesis of AcsA.  ***",
