 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical compounds used by animals for communication signals are called   pheromones.  Much of the early work on pheromones was done using the   extremely sensitive antennae of moths, and their role in mate attraction.    Females of many insect species produce blends of chemicals that are released   into the air, and males that are downwind perceive these pheromones and fly   upwind along the odor plume to the female.  An important area of research   includes the parameters that control response specificity in the males.  Receptor   cells in the antennae are specific for particular compounds, and the antennal   nerve carries this information to the brain.  It remains unclear how information is   processed from the periphery to the central nervous system, leading to   recognition of the mixture of compounds.  This project uses an agriculturally   important insect, the European corn borer moth, that has hybrid races which   exhibit different levels of specificity for ratios of components that comprise their   pheromones.  A novel technique of transplanting the embryonic cells that form   antennae will be used to grow the antennae of one hybrid on the body of another   hybrid form.  The behavioral sensitivity will demonstrate whether the specificity   to a particular blend depends more on the antennal receptors or on the brain   processing of the integrated inputs.      Results from this work will provide important insight on the relative role of   central and peripheral processing of pheromones, and will lead to advances in   understanding other chemosensory systems as well as pheromone-mediated   behavior.  The impact also will extend beyond neuroscience to agriculture, in the   strategies for control of pest and beneficial insect species.",
