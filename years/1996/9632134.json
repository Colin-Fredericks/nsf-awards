 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632134  Traniello    Termites  are  among the most abundant and important  insects  in  many  ecosystems, owing to their ability to digest cellulose  and  recycle  the nutrients that are found in leaf litter,  humus  and  dead  wood.   And  because of their wood-eating habits,  termites  have  great economic impact as they are responsible for over $600  million  dollars structural damage annually in the united  States  alone.   In   spite  of  their  great  ecological  and   economic  significance,  the  biology  of termites  is  poorly  understood.  There  are  two  features of termite behavior  and  ecology  that  appear  to  have been pivotal in their evolutionary  history  and  thus  critical to understanding their biology.  First,  they  are  social,  forming colonies of potentially millions of individuals.  Second,  they  nest  in  soil  and  decaying  wood.   Their  nest  environments  are  rich in microbes such as fungi  and  bacteria,  some  of  which may be agents of disease and mortality.   Indeed,  termites  appear to be highly susceptible to many pathogens.   We  believe that these two elements of termite biology - social  life  and  disease susceptibility - may be linked.  Research  into  the  ecology  of  disease,  along with research on  the  evolution  of  physiological and biochemical mechanisms that allow  termites  to  resist  infection at both the individual and colony  level,  will  provide important insights into termite social evolution.   As  a  consequence  of this research we will understand more  about  the  nature  of termite pathogens, their transmission within a  colony  and the ways termites cope with disease.  This will in turn allow  us to identify the natural vulnerabilities of termites that might  be  exploited  to  control them and thus limit their  destructive  potential.   Moreover,  studying termite  pathogens  and  disease  resistance   may   result   in   the   development   of    novel,  environmentally safe methods of termite control, as well  as  the   isolation  and  chemical characterization of natural  antibiotics  that could have medicinal value.",
