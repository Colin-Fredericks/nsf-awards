 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600968  Stone  The goal of the research is investigate the functional  relevance of active site dynamics in the enzyme glyoxalase I  (Glx I).  Heteronuclear NMR relaxation data will be used to  calculate parameters describing the internal motions on fast  (ps-ns) and slower (-ms) time scales.  Comparison of the  free enzyme with the enzyme bound to reaction product and to  transition state analog inhibitors will indicate the changes  in active site dynamics that occur along the reaction  coordinate of the enzyme-calatyzed reaction.  The role of  enzyme dynamics in controlling and limiting functional  kinetics will be investigated by correlating the rates of  Glx I catalytic turnover and of ligand association and  dissociation with the millisecond time scale dynamics.  The  proposed educational activities involve formal teaching  responsibilities at Indiana University as well as: (1)  undergraduate biochemistry curriculum development; (2)  graduate level molecular modeling workshops; (3) graduate  education in written comprehension and expression of  scientific ideas; (4) a practical course in NMR relaxation  and dynamics analysis for NMR professionals; and (5)  mentorship of graduate, undergraduate and high school  students.  %%%  Enzymes are protein molecules that catalyze (increase the  rate of) chemical  reactions.  They are involved in many  important biochemical and industrial processes.  The  proposed research will investigate the motions that occur in  enzyme molecules and the relationship between these motions  and the function of the enzyme.  In the long term such  studies may enable us to design new enzymes or to design  molecules.  The proposed educational activities involve  formal teaching responsibilities at Indiana University as  well as: (1) assessment and modification of the  undergraduate biochemistry curriculum to improve the  preparation of students for their target careers; (2) use of  manual and computerized model building as graduate level  educational aids; (3) developme nt of graduate courses in the  critical reading of research articles and the clear, concise  written presentation of scientific ideas; (4) composition of  a practical course for scientists interested in studying  motions in proteins; and (5) mentorship of graduate,  undergraduate and high school students including a specific  focus on minority students.  ***",
