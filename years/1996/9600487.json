The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit of Dr. Kenneth M. Haymes to work with Dr. ir A. M. P.  den Nijs at the Centre for Plant Breeding and Reproductive  Research (CPRO-DLO) in Wageningen, Netherlands.        Dr. Haymes and Dr. den Nijs will use molecular techniques to  obtain markers for regions of the strawberry genome that are  linked to genes Pfr1, Pfr2 and Pfr6, which confer resistance  to the pathogenic fungus Phytophthora fragariae Hickman (red  stele root rot).  They will also look at existing strawberry  stocks for the presence of these markers to develop a  rational breeding program for improved resistance to  Phytophthora infection.  A powerful mapping technique,  amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) will be used  following bulked segregant analysis to attempt to isolate  markers closely linked to the Pfr1 marker.  Bulked segregant  analysis and AFLP will then be applied to obtain markers  near to the other resistance genes.  The commercial  strawberry is octaploid and thus molecular markers are the  best hope for accomplishing rational linkage studies of  disease resistance and other traits.  Once they obtain  markers that are tightly linked to genes which increase  resistance to fungal infection, plant stocks will be  examined for the purpose of identifying appropriate breeding  stocks to produce strawberry plants containing multiple  resistance genes.  ***",
