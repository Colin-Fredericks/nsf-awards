 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for support for a program to investigate the visual  stratigraphy, index physical properties, relaxation  characteristics and crystalline structure of ice cores from Siple  Dome, West Antarctica.  This investigation will include  measurements of a time-priority nature that must be initiated at  the drill site on freshly-drilled cores.  This will be especially  true of cores from the brittle ice zone, which is expected to  comprise a significant fraction of the ice core.  The brittle  zone includes ice in which relaxation , resulting from the  release of confining pressure is maximized and leads to  significant changes in the mechanical condition of the core that  must be considered in relation to the processing and analysis of  ice samples for entrapped gas and chemical studies.  This  relaxation will be monitored via precision density measurements  made initially at the drill site and repeated at intervals back  in the U.S.  Other studies will include measurement of the annual  layering in the core to as great a depth as visual stratigraphy  can be deciphered, crystal size measurements as a function of  depth and age, c-axis fabric studies, and analysis of the  physical properties of any debris-bearing basal ice and its  relationship to the underlying bedrock.  Only through careful  documentation and analysis of these key properties can we hope to  accurately assess the dynamic state of the ice and the age-depth  relationships essential to deciphering the paleoclimate record at  this location.",
