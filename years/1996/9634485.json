This CISE Educational Innovation award supports the integration of research into the undergraduate curriculum through the development of a Distributed Collaborative Learning Environment (DCLE), a hybrid physical and electronic space which will enable teams of students to meet and learn in flexible configurations, across the computer science curriculum.  The project will include development and delivery of courses that exploit the new capabilities, formal assessment of the effectiveness of the new learning environment, and wide dissemination of concepts, architecture, and prototype systems developed.    In the DCLE environment, the students comprising a team may be in one room, even seated around the same table.  At other times, they may be seated around two or more tables, or some may be located elsewhere on campus (even geographically remote).  Whatever the physical layout may be, each student's computer is linked to those of all other teammates, and innovative system software provides powerful support for collaborative information development, sharing and exchange, through a variety of flexible and natural interfaces suited to the task and the individual user.    This project is part of an overall effort jointly supported by the Office of Cross Disciplinary Activities (CDA) in CISE and the Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE) in EHR with the DUE funding supporting an emphasis on distance learning, utilizing the developed DCLE in a virtual classroom and with instruction delivered on an experimental basis from University of California/Davis to RPI.",
