 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a new, multidisciplinary research  training program focused on understanding microbial gene  regulation in bioremediation.  A group of 16 faculty drawn  from the departments of Microbiology, Biology, Chemistry,  Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, Civil and  Environmental Engineering, and Medicinal Chemistry at the  University of Iowa will provide education and training for  graduate students in the fundamentals of molecular genetics,  microbial metabolism, biochemical engineering, and  environmental engineering.  In addition to normal  departmental requirements, the training will include a set  of four required courses in biology and engineering,  required laboratory rotations in both areas, and  participation in an RTG-sponsored  symposium and seminar  series.   Multidisciplinary thesis research, during which  students will be advised by two graduate mentors, will also  be required.  Undergraduate and postdoctoral students  sponsored by existing institutional and external funding  sources are expected to participate, but are not directly  supported by the award.   Students trained by this program  will have an unusual combination of training in basic and  applied aspects of both biology and engineering, and will  have a new perspective on environmental regulation of gene  expression and the metabolic diversity of microorganisms.",
