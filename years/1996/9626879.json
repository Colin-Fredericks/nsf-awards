 "awd_abstract_narration": "STUMP  9626879     Capturing the popularity of dinosaurs and other fossils, Dinofest International will be a major science education event inspiring interest in science by everyone who attends or otherwise participates.  Dinofest International is unique in that it transcends and builds bridges across the boundaries between scientists and nonscientists, students and teachers, and the interested public.  Through displays of fossils from the seven continents, the public will gain an understanding of their world wide distribution and the international nature of science beyond political boundaries.  Three primary and interrelated components will be presented at Dinofest International:  1) science education centering on a spectacular exhibit of dinosaurs and other fossils, 2) a symposium of dinosaur experts presenting papers intelligible to non-specialists, and 3) an interactive broadcast linking a panel of dinosaur experts with audiences of school children at remote sites throughout North America.   The prime focus of Dinofest International will be tens of thousands of square feet of dinosaurs and other striking fossils, many never seen before, organized about the theme of hands-on exhibits and demonstrations, for school children and their teachers.  Study guides and opportunities for teacher training will be provided.  A symposium involving the world's leading dinosaur experts will cover all aspects of dinosaurs, such as how they functioned and behaved, theories of extinction, and DNA cloning.  The emphasis will be on clear, understandable presentations geared for the literate public, as well as the experts.  A special session on Science Education and Policy will be featured.  A proceedings volume will also be published.  The third major component of Dinofest International will be a live broadcast from Arizona State University involving a panel of dinosaur experts responding to questions and comments from school children at a number of selected sites across North America and possibly elsewhere in th e world.   Additional components of Dinofest International include a large, multi-media art exhibit displaying pictorial and three dimensional art with a natural history/dinosaur theme, and a film festival during which the classics of dinosaur-centered films will be shown.",
