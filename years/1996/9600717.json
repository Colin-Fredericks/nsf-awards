 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to collect data on the Narpa  language, data that will be used by the Principal Investigator to  prepare for publication a grammar, dictionary, and a collection  of texts. Narpa is a member of the Tamangic group within the  Bodic branch of Tibeto-Burman. It is spoken in the Manang  District of Nepal by about 800 people. While the language is  still the principal medium of communication in two villages, the  small size of the population, the relative poverty of the people,  and their bilingualism in Nepali, the national language, all  point to the fact that the language could cease to be spoken  rather quickly. A couple of short word lists apart, there  currently is no published documentation on the Narpa language.       The grammar will be produced in a relatively  non-theoretical, descriptive framework so as to be of maximum  utility to Sino-Tibetanists, anthropologists, and general  linguists of various theoretical persuasions. The grammar and  dictionary will contain copious illustrations from both elicited  and textual material. The texts will be chosen to exemplify  several discourse types and a variety of cultural situations, and  will be accompanied by morpheme-by-morpheme glosses as well as  translations into idiomatic English. All three components    grammar, dictionary, texts   will be keyed to each other.",
