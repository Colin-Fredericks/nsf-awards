 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program provides continued support to Dr. Michael Lattman of the   Chemistry Department, Southern Methodist University, for the   investigation of main group elements with macrocycles, that is, large   organic species which bind to the main group element through more than   one atom.  The macrocycles used in this project, calix(4)arenes, can bind   through up to four oxygen atoms, imposing constraints which result in   unusual types of bonding.  For example, six coordinate compounds of   phosphorus and silicon have been observed in these systems.  The goal of   this research is to prepare and characterize phosphorus and silicon   compounds of this type, including the synthesis of clusters of the   macrocyclic units.  In some cases, silicon-transition metal bonds will be   formed in the chain-links between the macrocyclic units.  In other cases,   transition metals may be able to be incorporated into cavities formed by   the macrocycle as sterically adjusted by association with phosphorus or   silicon.  This fundamental research is primarily designed to test the bonding   capabilities of silicon and phosphorus, but may result in improved   understanding of the action of transition metals in shape selective   catalysts or a new approach to catalyst design.",
