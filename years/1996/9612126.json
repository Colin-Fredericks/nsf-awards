Based on these findings, techniques will be developed that will assist individuals and organizations in the decisions within the innovation process that require integration of social and behavioral factors as well as financial and technological considerations.  These techniques will be evaluated and refined with Manufacturing Learning Center (MLC) members and their impact evaluated on MLC members' innovation process results.  The techniques identified through this project will be integrated into the learning experience of the student interns with MLC as well as shared through publications and workshops.        This work should offer a broader understanding of the social and behavioral barriers to innovation in small manufacturing firms as well as providing management techniques to minimize these barriers to the innovation process in these types of organizations.    ***",
