This work is one of forty-four projects that are  collaborating in the Southern Ocean Experiment, a three-year  effort south of the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone to track the  flow of carbon through its organic and inorganic pathways from  the air-ocean interface through the entire water column into the  bottom sediment.   The experiment will make use of the RVIB  Nathaniel B. Palmer and the R/V Thompson.       This component concerns a cooperative study of organic  matter cycling in the water column and in the surficial sediments  of the Southern Ocean.  The main goals of the effort are: (1) to  determine how the composition and fluxes of organic material vary  regionally and seasonally within the Southern Ocean, (2) to  relate these variations to biological processing of the  punctuated organic input and its siliceous matrix,  (3) to follow  the downward diagenetic fate of planktonic remains through the  water column and into the underlying sediments, with special  emphasis on biochemical trends reflecting substrate quality  (freshness), and (4) to holistically account for total organic  matter at all stages of degradation by carbon-13 analysis of bulk  trap and sediment samples.       The shipboard work involves collecting suspended and raining  particulate material within the water column and from the  underlying sediment at several sites along the proposed study  transect. Suspended particles will be collected both by plankton  net tows and high volume filtration of surface water.  Sinking  particles will be collected with  modular sediment traps deployed  in arrays of four.  Individual traps will be designed to  selectively collect sinking particles and reject swimming  zooplankton without loss of sample or biocide.  Two of the four  traps on each array will be fitted with 12-tube subsampling  carousels to study shorter term variations.       The collected trap and sediment core samples will be  analyzed for their basic biochemical building blocks, such as  carbohydrates, amino acids, lipids, lignins, and pigments.  These  make up the bulk of the organic matter produced in the upper  water column and are an important fraction of the material buried  in the sediment.  At the molecular level they can provide  unequivocal information on the sources of organic matter and its  decomposition at depth, and on the pathways by which biogenic  material is transferred to the sediment.  These data will be  combined with information obtained during prior JGOFS experiments  to produce a global picture of the organic chemistry of  particulate matter in the ocean.  This research project is part of the US Joint Global Ocean Flux  Study (JGOFS) Southern Ocean Program aimed at (1) a better  understanding of the fluxes of carbon, both organic and  inorganic, in the Southern Ocean, (2) identifying the physical,  ecological and biogeochemical factors and processes which  regulate the magnitude and variability of these fluxes, and (3)  placing these fluxes into the context of the contemporary global  carbon cycle.",
