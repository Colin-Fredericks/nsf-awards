 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is the editing and publication of a dictionary of the  ritual languages of the Iban of Borneo. The dictionary will contain  approximately 20,000 entries. No dictionary for any of the ritual  languages of Borneo currently exists.     The Iban are the politically dominant and most numerous indigenous  society on Borneo, the third largest island in the world. Iban are  found in all parts of the island, and in many other countries in  Southeast Asia. Iban speakers number approximately 1,100,000, and  Iban is the second language to another 500,000 people.    The dictionary will provide a permanent record of the survivals,  archaisms, and other esoteric terms that receive little attention  in most dictionaries. The dictionary will make available to  linguists, anthropologists, and other social scientists the  extensive lexicons and imagery of Iban bards and shaman, as well  as the oral traditions of the Iban. The lexicon of ritual terms  will be valuable to historical linguists for the study of  relationships between vernacular and ritual languages of  Austronesian-speaking communities. It will provide data essential  to the analysis of the evolution of such specialized  vocabularies. In light of rapid social and cultural changes, it  seems likely that unless the dictionary is produced before the  end of this decade, its production will be impossible.",
