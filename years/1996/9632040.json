LeHigh University  Title: Sub-Decadal Reconstruction of Drought Patterns in North  American's Arid Interior: the last 2000 years    Recent paleoclimatic studies from several regions of western North  America suggest that the climate of the last century may not be  representative of long-term patterns of climate variability.   Paleolimnological work from southeastern North Dakota suggests that  intervals of severe multi-decadal drought have been common during  the last two millennia.  This award supports a study to reconstruct  at sub-decadal intervals the frequency, duration, and magnitude of  major drought in the northern Great Plains of North America and to  examine how these moisture patterns are manifest in vegetation,  hydrology, and geomorphic processes.  Reconstructions will be based  on analysis of Kettle Lake in northwestern North Dakota, which has  laminated, probably varved sediments.  This site has the potential  to provide an absolute chronology of drought in the north-central  grasslands of North America that can be linked to records elsewhere  to reconstruct broader scale atmospheric circulation patterns in  the past.  The project is part of the PEP-1 transect for western  North America and is essential for characterization of the east to  west structure of the climate system.",
