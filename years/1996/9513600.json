 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peptides and proteins are the principal components of most  biologicalsystems. Determination of the amino acid sequence  is an essential first step for structural characterization.  The current generation of protein sequencers, which include  an on-line HPLC and uv detector, all utilize basic  technology and instrumentation developed 10-20 years ago.  With only modest enhancements in recent years, protein  sequence analysis has failed to keep pace with advancements  in other methods of protein structural analysis, such as  mass spectrometry, and protein purification techniques.  While it is possible to purify and determine accurate masses  of protein with femtomole amounts of sample, routine protein  sequence analysis by Edman chemistry still requires 10 - 50  pmoles of sample. The objective of the proposed research is  to develop a micro-scale protein sequencing system capable  of routine analyses at sample levels well into the fmole  range (5~500 fmole). The instrument would use standard Edman  chemistry for N-terminal sequencing. The design would be  sufficiently flexible that it could be adapted to other  chemistries that utilize fluorescence detection or to C  terminal sequence analysis. Improvements in sensitivity  would be achieved by novel designs for the sequencer and  HPLC systems, and the use of state-of-the-art absorbance  detection utilizing a pulsed light source.",
