It will also provide technical support to Bolivian researchers interested in dendrochronological studies.  Most Bolivian trees are also found in other Latin American countries, and consequently, the proposed studies will be relevant to foresters and climatologists within all of the tropical Americas.  This Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) Start-Up Grants Phase I proposal has as it objective to conduct a survey of the Bolivian woods to evaluate their dendrochronological potential as well as training of scientists in tropical South America.  The exploratory survey will include the evaluation of tropical trees growing under different climatic (seasonal versus non-seasonal) and topographic (upper Andes versus lower Amazonian Basin) conditions in Bolivia in order to determine their dendrochronological characteristics.  In addition, under this Phase I proposal, personnel from the Laboratorio de Dendrocronolog=EDa of Mendoza, Argentina, will teach two 15-day seminars on dendrochronology at the Universidad Major de San Sim=F3n at Cochabamba, Bolivia, and the Universidad de San Andr=E9s, La Paz, Bolivia.  Scientists from Bolivia and other Latin American countries will be invited to work at the Laboratorio de Dendrocronolog=EDa in Mendoza as visiting scholars.  The seminars will focus on the following topics:  wood anatomy; dendrochronological sampling strategies; cross-dating; tree-ring chronology development; and time-series analysis.  The result of Phase I will be a Phase II Proposal with the objective of developing a tree-ring chronology network in western tropical South America.  %%%  This Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) Start-Up Grants Phase I proposal will expand dendrochronological studies to tropical and subtropical regions of South America with special emphasis o n the Bolivian forests.  It will also provide technical support to Bolivian researchers interested in dendrochronological studies.  Most Bolivian trees are also found in other Latin American countries, and consequently, the proposed studies will be relevant to foresters and climatologists within all of the tropical Americas.  Much has been documented about Northern hemisphere climatic variations, but comparatively little data is available for the Southern hemisphere.  A complete understanding of the climatic behavior of one hemisphere is not possible without knowledge of behavior in the other hemisphere. Meteorological records from instruments in the Southern hemisphere reach back only a relatively short time, and are far more sparse than those in the Northern hemisphere.  When working with records that represent such short time scales, trends lasting decades to centuries are difficult to evaluate with statistical confidence. However, one may rely on indirect sources, or \"proxy data,\" in order to study climatic variations before the   present century.  Tree-ring series can provide long and reliable recopds lasting from several centuries to millennia with annual and in some cases seasonal resolution.  The fields of dendrochronology and dendroclimatology have been making striking advances during he past twenty years, and their scientific bases are well documented.  This proposal will expand dendrochronological studies to tropical and subtropical regions of South America with special emphasis on Bolivian forests as well as the training of scientists in dendrochronological studies.  This proposal assembles a team of scientists from Argentina, Bolivia, and the United States.  These countries are Member States of the IAI, an initiative to stimulate cooperative research on global change issues among the scientific institutions of the Americas.  The National Science =46oundation is the designated U.S. Government agency to carry our the Unite= s  States responsibilities within the IAI. ***",
