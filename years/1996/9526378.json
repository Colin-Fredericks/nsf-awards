 "awd_abstract_narration": "9526378 Dutton  The main objective of this renewal proposal for NCCE (National Center for Computational Electronics) is to develop a shared vision and environment for computational electronics with primary emphasis on engineering TCAD tools and methodology.   Through validation of advanced modeling approaches to solving the Boltzmann transport equation, including calibration of the associated models, a hierarchy of macroscopic 2D device simulator capabilities will be developed.  Jointly with industry the tools and methodology will be used to established predictability for design and analysis of semiconductor devices  of feature size as small as 0.1um. This will include helping to establish a comprehensive set of benchmarks through international collaboration with NCCE's membership.  Other related goals are : (1) use of-state-of-the-art device simulation models and their graphics representation for developing educational course materials in device physics and electronics; (2) parameter extraction for physical models based on both experiment and microscopic simulation (i.e. Monte Carlo); (3) establishment of an electronic forum and pathway within the internet for timely information sharing regarding the latest development in device modeling.  Microscopic transport phenomena will be studied using Monte Carlo codes for solving the Boltzmann equation and used in support of developing and calibrating macroscopic models.  A leading Monte Carlo code, DAMOCLES from IBM, will be used at NCCE and provides a wealth of physical models and materials parameters for silicon as well as compound semiconductors.  The overall path for technology transfer and further development of educational materials for NCCE will extend well-established methods such as open access to TCAD tools, short courses,  workshops with supporting documents, articles and textbooks.  In addition, the new opportunities using WWW provide an exciting paradigm shift that will increase the effectiveness and impact of NCCE throughout the US and a mong the international community.",
