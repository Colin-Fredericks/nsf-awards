 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gravity reception in all vertebrate animals is done largely by structures called otolith organs in the vestibular system of the inner ear. These organs are pouches that contain dense calcified masses called otoliths; the action of gravity on these masses, overlying specialized mechanosensory cells, provides a signal for determining the normal earth-vertical direction.  Nerve activity from these otolith organs show combinations of excitatory and inhibitory firing patterns, and under some conditions the brain sends some kinds of modulation by nerve fibers called efferents, which affect the incoming firing patterns.  Not much information is available about long-term activity of gravistatic organs.  The flight of Neurolab provides a unique opportunity to test gravitational responses to forces far less than normal earth gravity, and so greatly extend the study range for testing hypotheses about neural encoding of gravity signals.  This project uses a novel electrophysiological recording technology in freely-moving fish to compare earth-based with space-based responses to gravity over a wide range of forces.     Results from this work will provide fundamentally important information on this sensory system, and will have an impact beyond vestibular neuroscience to sensory science in general, and is likely to be important to applied aspects of human spaceflight.   Contribution to this project represents the NSF Biological Sciences Directorate's participation in the NASA/Interagency Neurolab activity on the space shuttle orbiter, which in turn is part of Decade of the Brain activities.",
