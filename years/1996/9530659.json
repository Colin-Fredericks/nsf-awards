 "awd_abstract_narration": "9530659  Chu   This project will explore heterogeneous reactions of bromine which are potentially  important to polar ozone depletion and ozone loss in the tropospheric Arctic boundary layer.  The role of HBr (hydrogen bromide) conversion into photochemically active bromine on ice surfaces will be explored. The results of this study will lead to a better mechanistic understanding of uptake and heterogeneous reactions involved in ozone depletion.  The initial focus will be on uptake of HBr and the formation mechanism of HBr hydrates on ice film surfaces. The phase diagram of HBr-ice along with other thermodynamic properties will be determined from this study. The uptake of the hydrogen halides HF, HCl, HBr, and HI on ice surfaces will be compared and the trends interpreted in terms of acidity and the interactions of the hydrogen halides with the ice surfaces. The reaction probabilities and mechanism of gaseous HOCl and HOBr with HBr on ice surfaces will be determined under simulated atmospheric conditions.   %%%  This project will use a glass flow reactor, together with pulsed molecular beam sampling, quadrupole mass spectrometry, and phase sensitive detection methods. Formation processes for HBr hydrates will be examined using specular reflection-absorbance IR spectroscopy. The effect of the ice film surface morphology on HBr uptake will be investigated by using scanning electron microscopic and BET isotherm adsorption methods. Models will be developed to interpret the results.   ***",
