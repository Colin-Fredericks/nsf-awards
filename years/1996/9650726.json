 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Math, Science, and Engineering has, in the past, been operating with an instructional deficiency in teaching 17 courses that span the physical and life sciences and mathematics. Faculty have been working with an outdated Mathematics and Science Computer Assisted Learning Center (MSCALC) still equipped with original Apple II/e computers. The limited capabilities of the MSCALC has severely hindered the faculty' s goal of going beyond the currently used drill and practice exercises and adding an interactive laboratory simulation component to the mathematics and science curriculum.   The project aims to remedy this situation by redesigning the MSCALC, equipping it with Power MacIntosh computers that can run MacIntosh or IBM PC software. This new instructional technology enables science faculty members to offer laboratory exercises that can reinforce `wet lab` experiments and familiarize students with modern analytical techniques using computer simulations. The computers can be used for prelab orientation exercises, for simulations in areas where expensive instrumentation or materials are required, for visualization of complex lecture concepts, and for postlab exercises to reinforce and assess student learning. Mathematics students can use software packages to strengthen mathematical intuition and insight by representing mathematical ideas and objects (such as functions, matrices, differential equations, and infinite series) in a variety of forms that permit them to be experimented with and manipulated.   The project also specifically helps the majority_over 60 percent_of the college's students who are women, a great number of whom are returning to school after years at home or work. The project is helping these students gain further knowledge, help in their retention, and increase their competency and familiarity with modern computer systems.",
