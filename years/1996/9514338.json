 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514388  Martin    The long-range goal of the research is to provide new  insights into well-known but poorly understood, broad  patterns of nesting and foraging patterns of birds across  the Americas. To add to 10 years of data collected on  clutch sizes, nest predation rates, and food delivery  rates for ground-nesting warblers and shrub-nesting  thrushes in the north temperate forests, it is intended to  study birds of the same genus or subfamily in the tropics,  subtropics, and south temperate forests.  This U.S.-  Argentina Planning Grant will permit a planning visit to  Argentina to establish a collaborative effort with  Alejandro Brown of Universidad Nacional de Tucuman and to  visit possible study sites.  A critical first step is identification of a proper forest  system where phylogenetically-related species are abundant  and elevational segregation of species pairs is common.    The work of Thomas Martin is well respected for its rigor  and insight into nesting patterns, while the Argentine  collaborator, Alejandro Brown, is an experienced field  biologist in studies of foraging patterns.  Both the  potential for new insights through comparisons of closely  related species in differing environments and the  robustness added through the collaborative effort are  benefits to be expected from research stemming from the  planning visit. Results have potential for impact on  wildlife management and, more broadly, on our  understanding of ecological systems.  Additionally, Martin  will take a graduate student with him on the visit,  providing valuable field work and international experience  for a young scientist.  ***",
