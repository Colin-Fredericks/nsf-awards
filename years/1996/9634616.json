 "awd_abstract_narration": "Harwood  9634616    Abstract    Information derived from the study of fossil plants, animals, and  protists provides valuable data on age and paleoenvironment in  geological studies.  Paleontologists are actively studying the  stratigraphic record of evolution and environmental change in the  Southern Ocean and Antarctic area, in order to address questions  regarding climate change associated with the development of the  Antarctic Ice Sheet more than 40 million years ago and the  response of life to progressive cooling and ice sheet advance and  retreat.  Many gaps exist within the geologic record.  Recent and  future efforts are targeted at filling some of the major gaps  through stratigraphic drilling.  The Cape Roberts Project (CRP)  is the most recent drilling effort, with a target to recover a  record from 100 to 30 million years ago.  This will build on  recent drilling efforts on the margin of the Victoria Land Basin  (CIROS & MSSTS) and in the Southern Ocean by the Ocean Drilling  Program (ODP).  The new CRP initiative will focus on the early  history of ice sheets in East Antarctica and the conditions there  prior to the development of the ice sheet, when this region was  much warmer.  A workshop to address broad issues related to  AntarcticaOs biota and past environmental change in the southern  high-latitudes will be held on 21 to 23 May, 1996 in Wellington,  New Zealand.  The workshop will review the current state of  knowledge and provide a forum for scientists to develop  strategies and approaches for future research.  Of critical  importance to this workshop will be the development and  integration of biostratigraphic zonal schemes.  Reference  sections from the Southern Ocean and surrounding continental  margins of Australia, New Zealand and South America will be  compared in preparation for the 1996 and 1997 drilling at Cape  Roberts.  This award provide travel support U.S. paleontologists,  covering a range of fossil groups and considerable DSDP and ODP  experience, to particip ate in the workshop and communicate  directly with paleontologists and stratigraphers from other  countries involved with the Cape Roberts Project.  This effort  will enable a more coherent approach to the biostratigraphy and  paleontological analysis of Cape Roberts Project cores and  provide a forum to address larger issues related to the record of  life and environmental change in the southern high-latitudes.",
