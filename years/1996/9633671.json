 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor David Farrelly of Utah State University is being supported by   the  Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program.   The focus of this   research is to investigate ultrahigh molecular Rydberg states that are   typically excited in zero-electron kinetic-energy (ZEKE) spectroscopy.   These Rydberg states might also be used to probe the dynamics of   superfluid clusters containing impurity ions from seeding in beam   experiments. Such states lie at the correspondence principle limit of   quantum mechanics.  This research  will develop semiclassical theories to   describe the coupling between molecular core  and Rydberg electronic   degrees of freedom.  New adiabatic approximations will be developed to   describe the dynamics of such systems as well as the interactions with   external electric and or magnetic fields using complex coordinate   methods.     Studies of atoms and molecules in unusual situations, are of critical   importance to the advancement of the chemical and physical sciences.  The   superfluid state in particular continues to have an enormous impact on   technology and communications. Recently emphasis has been directed to   `nanotechnology` in which devices are  constructed that exploit the fact   that the physics of very small structures can  be dominated by quantum   effects not visible in the bulk. This research will  advance the   understanding of such single (or few) electron spectroscopies in the    context of elucidating the superfluid transition in finite size samples.",
