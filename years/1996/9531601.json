 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:  A Research Experience for Undergraduates Site at the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, will support 8 undergraduate researchers in solid earth geophysics for each of the next two years.  The program will give undergraduates majoring in the Geosciences and related disciplines experience in the types of research conducted at the Institute.  The objective is to engage students in the exciting research opportunities in seismology, volcanology, geochronology, geochemistry, paleomagnetics, geodesy, tectonics, glaciers and sea ice, and remote sensing, and encourage them to pursue graduate studies in these or other scientific areas.   Recruiting is focused at small liberal arts colleges where research exposure is less available.  Students get an accurate perspective on graduate student life by interacting with faculty, and graduate students, attending seminars and thesis defenses, and working closely with existing research groups.  Weekly lectures and field trips expose the students to fields of research `eyond their own projects.  A survey will be conducted to measure the impact of the REU program on educational and career choices of former participants.",
