 "awd_abstract_narration": "9624456  Krishnamurthy    This CAREER research project addresses fundamental issues in the control of nucleation and  ordering processes, and the use of morphological transitions during strained layer  epitaxial growth to create quantum-nanostructures.  A novel scheme for obtaining spatially  periodic Ge nanostructures on Si, by strain-induced preferential nucleation is propo  sed. Periodic strain fields provided by surface ripples in conjunction with coherent  islanding are suggested for producing a self-assembled array of nanostructures.  The  experiments will be guided by a quantitative model describing how preferential nucleation  depends on strain and growth kinetics.  Structures will be grown by molecular beam epitax  y and characterized by electron microscopy and scanning probe microscopy.  %%%  Along with the basic research, this project incorporates an activity for structuring an  Electronic Materials Processing and Design course sequence for undergraduate seniors  involving the formation of interdisciplinary teams of students working on group projects of  current research or industrial relevance. Student teams will be advised by faculty,  a graduate student and an industrial collaborator. This offers a team-approach to research  problem-solving, enhances the understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of electronic  materials research, and offers research leadership training to students.  A laboratory-  intensive course sequence emphasizing atomic scale materials processing and chara  cterization will also be introduced.  The proposed basic investigations of nanostructures  are expected to contribute fundamental materials science knowledge of technological  relevance to advanced microelectronic devices and circuits.  The knowledge and  understanding gained from this research project is expected to contribute in a general way  to im  pro  vin  g  the  per  for  man  ce  of  adv  anc  ed  dev  ice  s  and  cir  cui  ts  use  d  in  com  put  ing  ,  inf  orm  ati  on  pro  ces  sin   g,  and  tel  eco  mmu  nic  ati  ons  by  pro  vid  ing  a  fun  dam  ent  al  und  ers  tan  din  g  and  a  bas  is  for  des  ign  ing  and  pro  duc  ing  imp  rov  ed  mat  eri  als  wit  h  new  pro  per  tie  s  and  fun  cti  ona  lit  y.  ***  _",
