 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is to develop an effective caching  infrastructure for the design and implementation of caches in  modular systems.  Caching is a well-known technique for  exploiting locality to improve performance; unfortunately, caches  are often added to systems in an ad-hoc fashion.  The caching  infrastructure will improve cache development in the following  ways.  First, it will define a set of practical and efficient  external cache interfaces for integrating caching into modular  systems, such as object-oriented operating systems.  Second, it  will allow the functions of the cache itself to be modularized,  defining internal interfaces that allow the functions to be  easily modified and replaced.  The flexibility this affords will  allow the cache infrastructure to serve as a test-bed for  caching, enabling different cache algorithms to be easily  implemented and studied.  Third, the use of a common cache  infrastructure will allow global resource allocation decisions to  be made among caches that are competing for resources, thus  optimizing overall system performance.  This resource management  functionality will also include mechanisms for efficiently  transferring resources, such as data blocks, between caches.  Finally, the caching infrastructure will contain a toolkit  to enable the cache control functions, such as the cache  coherency protocol, to be defined via a high-level specification  which can be verified and compiled into an efficient  implementation.  ***",
