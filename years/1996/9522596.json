 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522596  Sperling    This proposal was submitted under the GOALI program and involves the collaboration of Lehigh University and Rohm and Haas Corp. in an industrially important program of research.    The objective of this proposal is to provide a study of the structural effects of polymers on interdiffusion, entanglement, and ultimate mechanical behavior.  The focus will be the effect ofionic end group substitution and x1 on interdiffusion.  A direct comparison of the diffusion coefficients, depth of interdiffusion, and volume fraction of mixing will be determined on various polymer pairs, one of which contains deuterium, chromophores, or both, with the objective of determining the relative advantages and potential drawbacks of measurements via small-angle neuron methods are being used successfully, no direct comparison of the two methods has yet been made.  In particular, positive x1 values are known to exist in deuterated-protonated polymer pairs, and a similar effect may exist in donor-acceptor pair chemistry.  The size of the donor and acceptor chromophores may impede interdiffusion.  Mechanical measurements on selected films are planned, to provide a more complete picture of the interdiffusion phenomenon, and to allow evaluation of scaling law relationships.    A series of anionically made polystyrenes and polymethacrylates containing deuterium or hydrogen, or donor acceptor fluorescent chromophores, or both kinds of labels will be obtained, with appropriate modification carried  out in house.  Polymers made via anionic polymerization and formed into latexes via interdiffusion observe by small-angle neutron scattering and non-radiative energy transfer, as appropriate.  Variables will include polymer molecular weight, time, and temperature of annealing of the films, and extent of labeling with various groups.    A series of new experiments are planned to explore the possibility of a thermodynamic acceleration.  Here, slightly negative x1 values may result in a more rapid interdiffusion of  polymer chains, with concomitant more rapid development of strength in the resulting films.    This will be a cooperative research between Rohm and Haas and Lehigh University personnel.  Rohm and Haas is committing $100,000 towards the successful completion of their portion of the research.  This research will be helpful in developing water-based coating technology, minimizing the need for solvents, plasticizers, or coalescing aids.  ***",
