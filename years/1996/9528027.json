 "awd_abstract_narration": "William Jorgensen is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research involving   theoretical simulations of organic reaction mechanisms in solution.  This   work involves the use of ab initio MO theory to obtain information   regarding the gas phase potential energy surface for organic reactions.    This information is then used in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulation   techniques to simulate the chemical reaction in solution.  The   combination of these methodologies provides  estimates of the solvated   free energy changes involved in a chemical reaction, and provides   important background information on the role which solvation plays in   chemical reactions.  These methodologies are being applied to various   important reaction mechanisms including the (2+2) cycloaddition, oxy-Cope   rearrangements, and alkoxide alkylations.  Simulations of host-guest   systems are also being performed with an emphasis on predicting binding   preferences of importance in the design of catenanes and rotaxanes which   show promise as the basis for molecular devices.  Computer-assisted   design of catalytic hosts using transition state geometries and charges   obtained from ab initio calculations is also being pursued.  This research is important for the elucidation of molecular-level effects   of solvation on reaction rates, intermolecular interactions and   host-guest binding in solution, and the influence of solvation on the   structures of molecules.  The theoretical studies closely parallel and   complement experimental work on the optimization of organic reactions and   on the development of catalysts, selective receptors for organic   molecules including drugs and metabolites, materials with novel   properties, and molecular devices.",
