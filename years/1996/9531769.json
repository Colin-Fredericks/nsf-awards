 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9531769  Vishik    The PI will investigate the mathematical problems of fluid motion.   Methods of harmonic analysis and partial differential equations will   be used to study the evolution of singularities and loss of smoothness   for the incompressible flows of an ideal fluid. The typical vorticity   field admissible for the analysis is not essentially bounded although the  set where it blows up is in some sense small. The  proposed  study   will provide precise information about the separation of Lagrangian   trajectories of liquid particles and generation of small scale structures  by the flow. The PI in collaboration with S.Friedlander  will continue to   investigate nonlinear instability and spectrum of small oscillations of an  ideal fluid about a given equilibrium using methods of dynamical systems  and spectral theory.   %%%         Mathematical theory of fluid motion is aimed at understanding phenomena  in fluids, such as turbulence, from the basic equations. This subject is  fundamental for applications in meteorology, geophysics, astrophysics,   oceanology, and aerodynamics.In the past, the partial differential   equations of fluid motion have been a source of several important concepts   in mathematics. The proposed research will address two problems. First,   one particular scenario of the evolution of fluid flow when mild   singularities are present in the velocity field, will be investigated.   Such flows of an ideal fluid may approximate viscous flows at very high   Reynolds number. The second line of research is hydrodynamic stability   theory.Its goal is to understand the general conditions for the parameters   and geometry of the flow under which fluid loses stability and to describe   frequencies of small oscillations when the flow is not too far from the   steady state.   ***",
