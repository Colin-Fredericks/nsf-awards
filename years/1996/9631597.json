 "awd_abstract_narration": "9631597  Bohs  This proposal involves the development and support of student  projects to aid the disabled, to be undertaken within the  framework of a new course in the Biomedical Engineering  Department at Duke University.  The objectives of the proposed  projects are to enhance engineering education, provide students  with insight into careers in working with the disabled, to  improve the quality of life of people with disabilities, and to  serve the community.  Students will be paired with health care  professionals who will suggest assistive or therapeutic  technologies to develop for a specific user or group.  The  student, health care professional and course instructor will  formulate a plan for implementation with the goal of producing a  completed project that meets the need of the disabled person, as  well as providing a challenging design experience for the  student.  Five or six projects are expected to be completed each  year, involving students working individually or as small teams.  In addition to project development, the course will involve  formal lectures on topics such as engineering design and ethics,  as well as numerous student presentations and written reports.  ***",
