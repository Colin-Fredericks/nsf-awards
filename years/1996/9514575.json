 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514575  MANDLER    This research will examine the development of conceptual thought  in infancy and early childhood.  Until recently there has been  little experimental work on this topic, but it has been assumed  that infants first form concepts about concrete objects, such as  dogs, chairs, and cars, and only later develop broader concepts  of animals, furniture, and vehicles.  However, prior research  from Mandler's laboratory indicates that the broader concepts  actually precede the more specific ones.  For example,  6-month-olds can see the difference between dogs and cats but  conceptually they treat them both as the same kind of thing.   This research will extend these findings to show how infants from  9 to 15 months form their first inductive generalizations about  the characteristics of animals, vehicles, and other classes, for  example, how they determine what kind of objects eat and what  kind of objects get ridden.  Several recently-devised techniques  will be used to study these issues.  One technique is to measure  how infants categorize little models of real-world objects.  Another technique is to see whether infants are more willing to  imitate appropriate behavior on these objects (such as giving a  dog a drink) than inappropriate behavior (giving a car a drink).  The research will also study early comprehension of object  labels, to see how broadly or narrowly infants interpret their  meaning.  The overall goal of the research is to provide a  systematic body of knowledge about the preverbal foundations of  concept formation and thought and its relation to early language  acquisition and preschool learning.  ***",
