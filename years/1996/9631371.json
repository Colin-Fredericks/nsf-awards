 "awd_abstract_narration": "9631371  Dilcher  A collection of over 100,000 fossil plants is housed at the Florida Museum of Natural History. This collection was originally organized by the PI, David Dilcher, and his students and colleagues. It was added to by regular collections made from the Eocene plant-bearing areas in western Tennessee and Kentucky, the coal mines in Indiana and Cretaceous clays in Kansas and Nebraska. Major contributions were made by co-PI Steven Manchester for his research on the Eocene and Paleocene fossil plants from western states. In addition to its areas of concentration, the collection now includes fossil plants from all over the world and many sites in the USA. This collection has become a major resource in the world and is visited regularly by people studying fossil plants from USA and other countries. Currently, there is no collection manager, and the collection is not well organized.  This project is a three year program to fund a Collection Manager position and provide some student assistance to catalogue and organize the specimens. When this collection is properly curated, it will be a national resource accessible and useful to the scientific community. The University of Florida is partnering with NSF to support this collection by maintaining the Collection Manager as a permanent position after the expiration of the grant.",
