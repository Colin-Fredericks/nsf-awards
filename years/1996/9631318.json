 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many important sampling problems occur within a spatial context.  Examples range  from estimating the total concentration of DDT at a dumpsite to counting the number of polar  bears in a region of Alaska to determining the number of distinct species in an ecosystem.   This project involves the problem of designing sampling schemes for spatial data where  information about the degree of clustering of the elements being sampled is utilized.   Initial  research will consider univariate point processes with extensions to the multivariate case.  The  basic premise is that some extant sampling schemes can be modified to take advantage of  available knowledge such as that assumed about the population units themselves or additional  information obtained during sampling.       The intended research is divided into several areas.  The first is based on a univariate  model. Two approaches will be considered.  One is a \"non-parametric\" sequential sampling  effort where no assumptions are made about the population under study.  Here, information  collected during sampling will be used to provide an initial characterization of the spatial  aspects of the population.  The other approach is parametric in that it will be assumed that the  population is generated via a general Poisson cluster process (or the more specific Neyman-Scott process).  Sampling will then be used to estimate the parameters as a means of  estimating the population size. The latter is useful when it is of interest to describe a more  general situation than exhibited by the current population (a single realization from the cluster  process).  Later, the results will be extended to the multivariate case.  Multivariate data  models of interest include a spatial marked point process such as would arise from a  superposition of spatial Poisson processes.",
