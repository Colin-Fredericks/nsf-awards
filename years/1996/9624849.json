 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research component of this program has two major thrusts: 1) an investigation  of the mathematical and computational aspects of the multiframe, bilinear image-  recovery problem; and 2) the development and application of solutions for  problems in the areas of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and  ground- and space-based astronomy.  Theoretical advances in this program are  providing a unified approach to many imaging problems in which intensity data are  recorded, including those for which satisfactory solutions have not been  previously discovered.  Collaborations with materials scientists on problems such  as the study of atomic scale processes in solid batteries are providing exciting  applications for which new methods developed in this program are being used to  enhance the resolving and information-gathering powers of electron microscopes.    Through the teaching component, an educational program is being established with  emphasis on 1) the development of a multidisciplinary laboratory in which faculty  and students from many departments jointly explore problems in remote sensing and  imaging; 2) the development of multidisciplinary courses in remote sensing and  imaging in which students from many departments are included, and the educations  goals for each student - ranging from theoretical foundations to specific  applications - are tailored to his or her individual needs; and 3) the use of a  strong research-teaching exchange in which cutting-edge technology is used in the  classroom and laboratory as a tool to excite, motivate, and retain enthusiasm in  the students",
