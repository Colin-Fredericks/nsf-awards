 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of  12  undergraduate students each year in the Research Experiences for  Undergraduates program offered by the Savannah River Ecology  Laboratory (SREL) of the University of Georgia.  This program,  which encompasses 12 weeks each summer, allows the students to  gain research experience, training and career perspective through  the use of the unique field sites and laboratory facilities as  well as through association with full-time research ecologists.  Project participants will examine the influence of by-products  from nuclear and fossil fuel energy production on selected  biological and chemical properties in southeastern ecosystems.  SREL faculty members, all actively engaged in research and  publication, will be paired with students having compatible  research interests.  Student projects, while distinct and  independent, are portions of on-going research programs of SREL.  The student experience is enhanced by interaction with a  programmatic team comprised of individuals with a diversity of  ecological backgrounds, interests, and ideas.  Applicants from  minority schools and regional institutions with limited research  programs will continue to be actively sought and encouraged, as  in previous years.  Participant selection is based upon the  quality of an application, letters of recommendation, and  academic record.  Through the research training of more than 500  undergraduate participants over the past 27 years, SREL has  created a highly successful program of student/advisor  interaction. Scientific publication and career development of  former participants attest to the success of the program.       This award will foster the continued education and training  of individuals who will be part of the next generation of basic  researchers in ecology and help to produce citizens informed  about various aspects of environmental sciences, management, and  decision making in environmental issues.",
