 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to produce a new medium for teaching  college-level mathematics and computing. The basis for this  medium is an on-line interactive data base of hypertext  integrated with formal reference material built with a  modern proof development system (Nuprl1). This hybrid of  text and formal material animated by a computer system  provides  an entirely new kind of courseware; it also  presents new opportunities for teaching those mathematical  problem solving skills found to be fundamental in the  educational literature. By connecting the new medium to the  emerging information infrastructure, the possibilities for  educational innovation are unprecedented.  Funding is  requested to create an example of this medium, explore its  educational value, and disseminate it. The material will be  deployed first in discrete mathematics courses (offered in  Mathematics, Computer Science and Electrical Engineering  departments). In such courses these tools will enable more  relevant and effective teaching of computational mathematics  and of the increasingly sophisticated mathematics of  software engineering--both critical to U. S. technology.  The proposal includes a detailed technical case for the  feasibility of what is proposed and a pedagogical case based  on the extensive teaching experience of the investigator and  on prior experimental efforts with limited examples of the  medium. The introduction summarizes the entire case whereas  the subsequent two sections elaborate. Section two details  the new research technology, and section three details the  pedagogical basis for the proposal.  Pronounced \"new pearl\".",
