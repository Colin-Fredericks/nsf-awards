It is  surrounded by actively spreading ridges except in the South  American sector.  The motion of South America with respect to  Antarctica is latitudinal and left-lateral at approximately 22 mm  per year and is distributed along the boundaries of the  intervening Scotia plate.  A prominent but discontinuous  bathymetric high known as the Scotia Ridge surrounds the Scotia  plate on three sides.  This feature includes some continental  material detached from the South American and Antarctic  continents, but its eastern closure is a volcanically and  seismically active group of islands, the South Sandwich arc, that  is separated from the Scotia plate by a vigorously spreading back-  arc ridge.  The entire east-closing, locally emergent bathymetric  feature joining the two continents, is known as the Scotia arc.  The D-shaped Sandwich plate and arc appear to be moving rapidly  east with respect to both South America and Antarctica, thereby  for the first time introducing a subduction system into the  otherwise rift-bounded South Atlantic Ocean basin.  This motion  may constitute the best evidence for mantle return flow from the  closing Pacific Ocean basin to the expanding Atlantic Ocean  basin.  The Scotia arc is nonetheless one of the most poorly  constrained of the major tectonic systems on Earth, yet it is a  critical and enigmatic link in global plate-motion circuits.    This SCotia ARc GPS Project (SCARP) will use the Global  Positioning System (GPS) to measure the plate motions between  South America, Antarctica, and Africa, and around the Scotia arc  using a newly developed geodetic strategy known as a multimodal  occupation strategy (MOST).  This involves setting up permanent  GPS receivers at a small number of sites in South America and  Antarctica, and using additional receivers to position numerous  stations relative to this continuously operat ing network.  Two  seasonally occupied stations in the South Sandwich islands will  be tied to permanent GPS sites in South America, Antarctica, and  Africa, and to intervening stations in the Falkland, South  Georgia, and South Orkney islands that will be occupied on an  occasional basis by British collaborators.  During the initial  three years the South Sandwich arc motion will be easily  resolved, and using roving stations in the Antarctic Peninsula-  South Shetland Islands area, it should be possible to determine  if extension is occurring across Bransfield Strait.  This project  will also construct a relatively dense subnetwork in  Patagonia/Tierra del Fuego, and a moderately dense subnetwork in  the Antarctic Peninsula.  While achieving sub-millimeter/year  velocity resolution in the initial three year project with these  subnetworks is not expected, this project will establish the  baseline necessary for a follow-on suite of measurements in  perhaps six to eight years.  The follow-on project will allow  characterization of the slow motions and deformations that occur  across and within the boundaries of the Scotia plate.    The objectives of SCARP are to determine:  1. the relative motions of the Antarctic, South American, Scotia  and South Sandwich plates;  2. strain partitioning within the South America-Scotia plate  boundary zone, Tierra del Fuego;  3. the rate of extension across the volcanically active  Bransfield trough and the present rate of uplift or subsidence of  the extinct South Shetland Islands volcanic arc;  4. and with our British colleagues, the rate of rollback of the  South Sandwich Trench in a South American-African framework;    These objectives in turn will allow:  1. An important contribution to a geodetic assessment of the  elastic displacement field associated with extension in  Bransfield Strait and the accumulation or loss of ice on the  Antarctic continent;  2. Determination of why there is transpression along the northern  boundary of the Scotia plate and tra nstension along its southern  boundary;  3. Testing for motion between East and West Antarctica postulated  as a source of error in global plate circuits; and  4. Evaluatation of what the South Sandwich trench rollback means  in terms of mantle flow and the potential for transforming a  passive rifted ocean basin into a subducting or disappearing  ocean basin.",
