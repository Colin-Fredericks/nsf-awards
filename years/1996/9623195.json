This  here-to-  fore  solely  theoretical concept controls the  dynamics  of  these  complex systems. The results of this study will  have  relevance  to  the  fields  of evolution,  protein  folding,  neural  networks,  and other physical phenomena  which  obey  hierarchical  structure in the arrangement of their  states.  The  parameter of interest is the non-linear magnetic  field  dependence  of  the  zero-field-cooled magnetization,  Mzfc.  This   quantity  will  be  determined  over   a   range   of  temperatures, from very low values up to the vicinity of the  spin-glass  temperature, Tg. Using a theoretical description  developed  by  the  investigators,  the  derivative  of  the  logarithm  of Mzfc with respect to the magnetic  field  will  generate  an  explicit  form for  P(q),  the  Parisi  order-  parameter   for   spin-glasses.  Using  other   experimental  \"calipers\", the study will attempt to extract the  branching  ratios  for  the hierarchical tree which governs  spin-glass  behavior.  %%%  Random  magnetic  systems, in particular, spin-glasses,  are  measurable  representations of a wide  variety  of  behavior  found  in  nature. Their properties can shed light  on  such  diverse  fields as human evolution, the behavior of proteins  in  solution,  and the functioning of the  human  brain.  It  appears that these seemingly random structures in fact  obey  very constricted geometries, an immense simplification. This  project  has  devised experiments which  should  enable  the  extraction  of  the  underlying geometry  by  measuring  the  magnetic properties of dilute magnetic alloys. The materials  will  be  investigated over a wide range of temperature  and  magnetic   field  with  the  objective  of  extracting   the  microscopic parameters which define their dynamic  behavior.  This will have relevance not only to this important class of  physical  s ystems,  but also to a wide  variety  of  natural  phenomena.  ***",
