 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ilan Benjamin, University of California Santa Cruz, is funded by a grant   from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his   theoretical work in the study of molecular dynamic simulations of   chemical reactions at liquid interfaces.  Equilibrium and non-equilibrium   molecular dynamics computer simulations and continuum electrostatic and   diffusion models will be used to investigate how the unique   characteristics of the interface affect the behavior of several   chemically reactive systems.  The problems to be studied include: 1)   solute accommodation and reactions at the water liquid/vapor interface;   2) gauche-trans isomerization reactions at the liquid/vapor interface of   liquid mixtures; 3) transfer of large hydrophobic ions across the   liquid/liquid interface; and 4) ion pairing at the electrochemical   liquid/liquid interface.  An important challenge in the field of chemistry is to understand at the   molecular level the effect of the solvent medium on chemical reactions.    Most chemical reactions of commercial importance occur in solution and   are frequently carried out in the presence of a catalyst.  Recent   development of a number of condensed phase experimental techniques, such   as femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopy and non-linear spectroscopy,   have provided new information on chemistry at the liquid-vapor and   liquid-liquid interfaces.  Benjamin's theoretical work will help to   provide a molecular level interpretation of this new experimental   information.",
