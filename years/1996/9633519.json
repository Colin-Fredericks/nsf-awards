The research areas include real-time applications of computer vision, neural networks, and mulitidimensional and multispectral signal analysis and modeling, all under a highly distributed and parallel platform.  This support provides a strong basis for the development of visual/sensing techniques in a multi-dimensional and multispectral framework to address various dynamic and static phenomena viewed either through real-time confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, or a high-speed motion analyzer.  Modeling of dynamic phenomena which integrate time with the three spatial dimensions; real-time image analysis and interpretation; application of the fundamentals of the wavelet theory; and implementations of the functional principles of the hypercolumn theory of the visual cortex constitute key research endeavors under this proposal.  The important concepts of parallelism, data compression and high-speed data communication play a significant role in the aforementioned research goals.  The existing NSF-CATE infrastructure and the support of this grant allows for a significant impact to be made not only in enhancing the theoretical foundation of the outlined research goals, but in carrying-out key applications with our industrial partners, especially in biomedical diagnostics.  ***",
