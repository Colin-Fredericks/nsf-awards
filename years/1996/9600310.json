Ruthazer at the University of Osaka, Osaka, Japan.  Dr. Ruthazer will work with Dr. Nobuhiko Yamamoto, Associate  Professor in the  Department of Engineering, on research  project entitled, \"Imaging and Analysis of Cortico-cortical  Projection Development in Organotypic Slice Cultures\"    The proposed research will develop and apply an in vitro  model of early corticocortical connection formation using a  novel callosum-intact cortical slice culture. The research  will examine the axon pathfinding and branching process in  living cultures made from thick (but optically penetrable)  brain slices that will include both cortical hemispheres and  the interconnecting callosal tract.  Single axons will be  labeled using vital, non-toxic fluorescent dyes and then  observed using scanning laser confocal microscopy over a  period of hours to days as they grow through their normal  environment and extend branches to contact the target  neurons in the other hemisphere.  In this way, it will be  possible to determine at exactly which locations axon  turning and branching occurs, and whether the development  involves direct and selective growth toward target sites or  a combined process of exuberant branching followed by  selective retraction of incorrect branches.  Once the  precise series of developmental events has been determined,  direct physical, pharmacological, and eventually genetic  manipulations will be used to analyze the specific  biochemical interactions that contribute to each step of the  developmental process.  ***",
