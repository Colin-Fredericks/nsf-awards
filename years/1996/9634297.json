 "awd_abstract_narration": "9634297  Berk    In this project, the investigators will develop methodological tools essential for computer   models used in integrated assessments. Three kinds of methodological contributions are   involved: 1) a flux coupler that links output from one model to input from another, 2)   methods to assess uncertainties in coupled computer models, and 3) statistical diagnostics   for coupled computer models. The flux coupler transforms model output in one set of   units, and for particular spatial and temporal scales, into model input in new units and   spatial temporal scales. The tools for assessing uncertainty capitalize on recent advances in   resampling procedures to represent sampling distributions for key model parameters and   outputs. The diagnostic techniques exploit new ways to link multiple inputs to multiple   outputs in a nonlinear fashion. As such, they provide a yardstick with which to judge the   performance of coupled computer models. The laboratory for developing and testing the   methodological tools is a coupled computer model linking local weather, local air quality,   and human outdoor water use for the Los Angeles Basin.    The interactions between humans and the larger physical and biological environment are   often simulated with large-scale computer models. In this project, the investigators focus   on how human water use affects local climate and air quality and then, in turn, is affected   by local climate and air quality. Outdoor water use, for instance, has impacts on local   temperature and the meteorological conditions that contribute to urban smog. But the   computer models used in such simulations need to be carefully evaluated. The key   products of this project are new tools for developing and assessing the computer models   used to understand human-environmental interactions. The new tools include: 1) a means   to allow computer models to more effectively transfer data between them, 2) methods that   allow the statistical uncertainties in the computer results  to be better described, and 3)   techniques for analyzing more thoroughly how well the computer models are using the   information provided to them. These tools all speak to the more general issue of   improving large-scale computer simulations in a wide variety of applications.",
