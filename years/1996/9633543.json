Tangible products of the FFC include symposia, which usually are  held at the National Academy of Sciences, and reports.  Through the  years, the FFC has conducted or sponsored more than 150 formal  studies and investigations dealing with virtually every aspect of  the design, construction, and operation of facilities.  By helping  the agencies solve problems and improve the design of federal  facilities, the FFC has saved taxpayers untold millions of dollars.",
