A prominent open question in this field is Thurston's Ending  Lamination Conjecture, which states that a hyperbolic 3-manifold is  uniquely determined by its topological type and a list of invariants  that describe the asymptotic geometry of its ends.  Consequences of  this conjecture include a rigidity theorem for Kleinian group actions  on the sphere, directly analogous to outstanding rigidity conjectures  in holomorphic dynamics, and a topological description of parameter  spaces of isomorphic Kleinian groups.  Minsky previously established  these conjectures in special cases, and the techniques developed show  promise for extension to the general case.  A number of projects have  grown out of this program, whose successful completion should  contribute to the solution of the conjecture, as well as being of  independent interest.  These projects investigate topological  characterizations of Kleinian group actions on the sphere, some  phenomena associated with geometric limits of Kleinian groups (with  R. Canary and J. Brock), and the large scale geometry and  combinatorics of the Teichmueller space of a surface (with H. Masur).  Minsky is also considering (with M. Lyubich) a new construction that  associates to a rational map a 3-dimensional hyperbolic object  analogous to the quotient 3-orbifold of a Kleinian group.  This object  renders more explicit the powerful analogies between Kleinian groups  and other holomorphic dynamical systems.       In the study of low-dimensional geometry, topology and dynamics,   one witnesses the depth of interconnection between fields of  mathematics.  Henri Poincare, who studied both celestial dynamics and  complex analysis (among many other things), observed in the 19th  century that the conformal transformations of the Riema nn sphere --  some of the building blocks of complex analysis -- extend to act on  the three-dimensional ball bounded by the sphere, and their action  preserves a complete, homogeneous metric, the metric of Hyperbolic or  Non-Euclidean Space.  This opened the door to a beautiful theory  relating topology, geometry, and complex dynamics, which was only  seriously explored in the latter part of this century.  The rigidity  problem mentioned above is essentially the question of to what extent  the topological, or combinatorial, properties of a system determine  its geometric properties.  This and other basic questions in the field  can be phrased in geometric, topological or dynamical terms, and are  still linked to some of the motivating questions about physical  systems of which Poincare was aware a hundred years ago.  Issues such  as classification of systems, mapping out regions of stability and  instability, deformation and bifurcation of families of systems, and  probabilistic properties such as ergodicity, all have significance in  both pure and applied mathematics.  Topology and geometry have already  provided deep insights into such issues, and one hopes that further  study of these interactions will continue to bear fruit.  ***",
