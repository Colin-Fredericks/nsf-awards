In today's power systems, controllers are arranged in hierarchy.   Controllers in higher levels adjust the set points of controllers  in lower levels.  But the controllers are not allowed to  cooperate (interact).  That is, controllers cannot help one  another to do a better job.  Specifically, no two controllers can  adjust the value of any system variable in the same time frame.   This precaution is taken to minimize the risk of instability.    Any control problem can be formulated as an optimization problem.   The authors of this proposal have shown that convergence to good  solutions of optimization problems is an emergent behavior of  certain mixes of autonomous agents, and much better solutions are  obtained when the agents are allowed to cooperate in certain  ways.  The implication is that much more effective control of  power systems could be achieved by autonomous controllers,  provided these controllers cooperate in the right way.  The  proposed work is to provide a proof-of-concept for this idea and  identify the forms of cooperation that would provide control  advantages.  If successful, this work will open a new research  area--cooperative control--and take the first step in  dramatically changing the way power systems are controlled.    Emerging hardware technologies, such as flexible AC transmission  systems, electric storage, and fuel cells, make cooperative  control feasible.  Many of these technologies are already in the  demonstration stage.  Once they reach the deployment stage, it  will probably be too late to introduce a new control technique.   Therefore, it is imperative that the preliminary investigation of  the idea of cooperative control be undertaken immediately.  ***",
