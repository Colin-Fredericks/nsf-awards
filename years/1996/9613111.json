Recent environmental constraints necessitate innovations on dry machining or other techniques.  The research project is to develop novel nanocoating technologies on cutting tools for dry machining.  This research project will conduct the following investigations:  (1) synthesize the characterize multilayer nanocoating systems on cemented tungsten carbide cutting tools by closed field unbalanced megnetron sputtering (CFUMS); (2) optimize the nanocoating architecture, thickness of the carbide layer, metal interlayer thickness and number of layers, and deposition conditions of CFUMS for a given application; (3) evaluate multilayer nanocoating systems in dry machining of selected work materials over a wide range of feeds, speeds, and depths of cut; (4) evaluate the performance of the nanocoating systems in dry machining and compare it with uncoated as well as candidate commercial coating systems; (5) determine the micromechanisms of tool wear and relate to the structure and composition of multilayer nanocoatings and (6) assess the payback of dry machining with numerous nanocoatings and identify new applications for nanocoatings as well as for dry machining of other materials.   This project is a collaboration between an industrial partner and the University.  The outcome of these studies could provide useful findings for the machining industry.",
