 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earthquakes which occur on ocean floors set in motion the  entire water column above the region of tectonic plate  motion, generating a tsunami (seismic sea wave). Such waves,  when approaching shore, can reach a height of more than 10  meters and can cause extensive flooding, property damage,  and the loss of human lives. This action is to support a  comprehensive research program to understand local tsunami  effects on man-made and natural structures. Particular  emphasis is placed on understanding tsunami-structure  interactions that can lead to effective damage mitigation  measures.    The program includes computational, experimental, and  mitigation components conducted by research teams at  Southern Methodist University, the University of Washington,  and Urban Regional Research, respectively. The new robust  method for the numerical simulation of waves and their  interaction with structures developed at Southern Methodist  University is used to simulate transient tsunami flows over  and around coastal structures. The highly sensitive  capacitance-type wave gage, and the optical water-surface  profiler developed at the University of Washington is used  to conduct tsunami experiments in a specialized three-  dimensional wave basin. The direct field experience of Urban  Regional Research in the assessment of tsunami damage and  the identification of vulnerability patterns guides the  computational and experimental research. The collaborative  effort enables the development of tsunami mitigation  measures.    The set of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations  are sufficiently simple that the basic physics of tsunami  actions on structures can be explored. At the same time, the  experimental set-up and choice of problems is realistic, so  that the results provide the means for the design and  modification of shoreline structures. Throughout the  research, full advantage is taken of the multi-disciplinary  nature of the research team. The analyses of actual tsunami  events guides the  numerical and experimental efforts by  focusing the proposed investigations on the most practical  and relevant problems for tsunami hazard reduction.    The intended, primary impact of the proposed research is the  mitigation of the devastating consequences of tsunami  events, including loss of human life, destruction of  property, damage to the environment, economic disruption,  and social dislocation.",
