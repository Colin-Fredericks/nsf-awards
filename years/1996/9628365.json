 "awd_abstract_narration": "A class of multi-user transmitter optimization problems is treated in the  context of mobile cellular communications. THe objective is to optimize  transmitter pulse shapes given a variety of assumptions concerning the  channel model, receivers, and signaling constraints. Solutions to these  problems reveal optimal multiple-access strategies, given particular sets  of modeling assumptions. The work may also lead to adaptive algorithms for  multi-user transmitter optimization which enable a significant increase in  system capacity.  Both linear time-invariant and statistical (i.e.,  Rayleigh fading) channel models will be considered. Models for an isolated  cell (the multiple-access channel), an isolated pair of cells, and a linear  array of cells are presented. In the latter two cases, neighboring base  stations may share information (i.e., received or transmitted signals for  the reverse or forward link, respectively).  The multi-cell channel models  can capture different combinations of intra- and inter-cell multiple-access  schemes. Antenna diversity at the transmitter and/or receiver will also be  included.  Receivers include the (single-user) matched-filter, and  multi-user linear and decision-feedback detectors. In most cases the  transmitters and detectors will be optimized according to a zero-forcing or  Mean Squared Error criterion.  For statistical channel models, the  objective is to optimize performance averaged over the channel parameters.  Multi-user transmitter optimization assuming multi carrier signaling will  also be considered. In this case the objective is to maximize the size of  the rate region by allocating transmitted bits and power to subchannels  (independently for each user), subject to performance constraints. Finally,  transmitter adaptation in the presence of time-varying channels and  interference, and associated performance issues are studied.",
