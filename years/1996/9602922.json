 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organic individuality has been an important problem in evolutionary and developmental biology  for over one hundred years.  Theories of evolution usually take for granted that its subjects are  individuals (whose characteristics vary), while developmental biology tries to explain how  individuals come to have their most characteristic properties.  But what does it mean to be an  `individual,` and how are individuals in biology--individual organisms, cells, or DNA  molecules--different from individual entities in, say, chemistry, quantum mechanics, or  sociology?   The PI will use the Fifth International Congress of Systemic and Evolutionary  Biology, to be held in Budapest, Hungary, August 17-24, 1996, as an occasion to gather a group  of philosophers working on this theme.  They would prepare papers for presentation at the  conference and meet among themselves and with others present to initiate inquiry into the nature  of organic individualism.",
