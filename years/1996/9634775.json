 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this project is to develop a \"point design\" for an advanced MIMD computer system capable of achieving at least 100 TeraOPS performance with technology that will definitely become feasible in less than a decade.  This design will take advantage of free-space optical technologies to produce a one-dimensional building block (BB) that implements efficiently a large, almost fully-connected system of processors.  In addition to having a scaleable architecture, our BB is also technology scaleable, and therefore the number of contained processors in the BB could increase dramatically with expected improvements in optical technologies.   A simple two-dimensional structure is proposed for the complete system, where the aforementioned one-dimensional BB is extended into two dimensions.  With readily available technology, the word-wide optical interconnection network can be viewed as a mesh of relatively short plastic bars to which interfaces to processor cards are attached.  Each processor card contains eight processors interconnected locally with an electronic crossbar.  Taking advantage of higher-speed optical technologies, all eight processors share the same optical interface to the two-dimensional system.  Its high-level architecture is also scaleable, because it can be extended straight forwardly for any number of dimensions larger than two.",
