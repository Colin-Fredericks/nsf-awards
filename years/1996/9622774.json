The  SE  techniques applied here are unique in their  ability  to  determine  the  optical properties and electronic structure  with  monolayer  sensitivity as a continuous function of thickness  for  films  fabricated  by methods employed widely  in  industry,  for  example,  plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition and magnetron  sputtering.  The research is divided into two projects:  (I)  the  preparation of semiconductor films and the study of size  effects  in   these  films  as  they  evolve  from  clusters  through  the  coalescence stage to continuous growth, and (ii) the role of  gas  composition, substrate material, and substrate temperature on the  evolution  of  bonding  and  structure  in  diamond  films.   The  materials  systems studied have a wide range of  applications  in  thin  film  photovoltaic devices, photon  and  electron  emission  devices,  and  optical  and mechanical  coatings.  As  a  result,  synergistic  relationships  will  be  established  between   this  program and other programs with industry for the transfer of  new  instrument designs, materials technologies, and human resources.  %%%  The growth of thin films under vacuum from vapor sources will  be  studied  as they are formed, atomic layer-by-layer. Such  studies  will  make  use of novel, high-speed measurement techniques  that  involve  directing a polarized white light beam into the reactor,  reflecting it from the surface of the growing film, and detecting  the  change  in  polarization upon reflection.  These  techniques  provide  the thickness of the film with atomic layer sensitivity,  the  growth  rate  of the film, and its optical  properties,  t he  latter   including  the  index  of  refraction   and   absorption  coefficient.  The  films  to  be studied  include  amorphous  and  crystalline  semiconductors,  with applications  in  optical  and  electronic devices such as solar cells and light-emitting diodes,  and   diamond  with  applications  as  optical,  mechanical,  and  electron-emitting  coatings.  The program  has  four  goals:  (i)  developing   high   sensitivity  optical  instrumentation,   (ii)  obtaining  a  better understanding of how thin films grow,  (iii)  optimizing  thin films for specific applications  based  on  this  understanding,  and  (iv) establishing synergistic  relationships  between  this  program and other programs with industry  for  the  transfer  of new instrument designs, materials technologies,  and  human resources.  ***",
