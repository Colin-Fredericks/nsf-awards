 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research involves the chemical characterization of natural  inducers of larval settlement and metamorphosis in several species  of marine invertebrates.  The goal is to isolate and characterize  the active molecules that function as natural inducers.  Natural  inducers will be studied for the nudibranch Phestilla sibogae  (Opisthobranchia:  Nudibranchia) that specializes on Porites  corals; the tube-building polychaete worm Hydroides elegans, a  ubiquitous fouling organism that settles in response to chemical  cues from microbial films; and the herbivorous sea hares  Stylocheilus longicauda, Aplysia juliana and Aplysia parvula  (Opisthobranchia:  Anaspidea) that specialize on certain seaweeds.    Isolation of active compounds will be carried out by  chromatographic separations of active extracts with subsequent  bioassays of larval settlement to determine which fractions induce  settlement and metamorphosis.  Once purified, NMR and other  spectroscopic methods will be used to elucidate the structures of  active inducers.  This approach to isolating and elucidating the  structures of natural inducers will work best for relatively small  organic molecules or peptides, and may require modification to use  chemical or enzymatic degradation techniques if inducers are  proteins or other large macromolecules.  Understanding the chemical  nature of specific cues for settlement and metamorphosis of marine  invertebrate larvae is important for different fields including  developmental biology, marine benthic community ecology, and  aquaculture.    Interactive activities include developing and teaching a graduate  course in Chemical Ecology and a graduate seminar in Marine  Chemical Ecology at the University of Hawaii Department of Zoology;  participating in Natural Products Chemistry and Organic seminar  courses at the University of Hawaii Department of Chemistry; and  mentoring undergraduate students and interacting with graduate  students and postdoctoral researchers at the Kewalo Marine  Laboratory  and the Zoology and Chemistry Departments at the  University of Hawaii.",
