 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) is supported in  the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  During the tenure of  this twelve-month standard grant, Professor Winograd and his  research group at the Pennsylvania State University will explore  the feasibility of using time-of-flight secondary ion mass  spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) methods for the chemical analysis of  combinatorial libraries.  The molecular specificity of TOF-SIMS  methods, coupled with the two-dimensional spatial resolution of a  rastered ion beam, will be used to analyze combinatorial libraries  formed on Merrifield bead substrates.  Success in this endeavor  will enhance the speed with which such libraries can be analyzed  and accelerate progress in the area of combinatorial methods of  synthesis.  Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry is an extremely  powerful technique for molecular identification and quantification.   The inclusion of rastered ion beam technology adds two-dimensional  spatial resolution to this analytical capability and suggests a  method for the rapid analysis of `libraries` of chemical compounds  produced by combinatorial synthetic methods.  Professor Nicholas  Winograd and his students at Penn State University will determine  the feasibility of this analytical approach with support from this  Small Grant for Exploratory Research.  The development of  successful strategies for combinatorial library analysis will  assist markedly in the advancement of this area of synthetic  chemistry.",
