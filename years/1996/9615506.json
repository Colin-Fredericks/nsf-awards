 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marianne Page  University of California - Davis  SBR-9615506    Recent discussions of sources of inequality have suggested that  individuals' human capital and other socioeconomic outcomes may  be strongly influenced by the neighborhoods in which the  individuals grew up.  Particular concern has focused on the role  of \"underclass\" neighborhoods in perpetuating poverty and welfare  dependency.  The purpose of this research is to identify an upper  bound on the socioeconomic impact of community origins by  estimating correlations between neighboring children in their  later socioeconomic status as adults.  The estimates will be  based on data from the Panel Study on Income Dynamics, which has  sampled neighboring children and followed them into adulthood.   This approach can identify only an upper bound on the influence  of neighborhoods because the observed neighbor correlations will  reflect the influence of similar family backgrounds as well as  the influence of shared community background.  Nevertheless,  neighbor correlations will provide crucial information on the  potential scope of neighborhood effects.  Large neighbor  correlations would leave open the possibility that neighborhoods  are very influential.  Small neighborhood correlations would  indicate that community origins must play only a minor role.",
