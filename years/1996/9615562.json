 "awd_abstract_narration": "Goodge  9615562    Abstract    This award supports four meetings of the Antarctic Working Group  for Geology and Geophysics (ANTWG^3) over the two year from 1996-  1998.  The ANTWG^3 affords a broad conduit for exchange of  information between the Antarctic Geology and Geophysics Program  within the US Antarctic Program (USAP), and the diverse parts of  the broadly-defined Antarctic earth science community.  As such,  it is a forum for discussion of the future goals of Antarctic  geological and geophysical research, and the future needs of  researchers from the operational and science support portion of  the USAP.  More specifically, the Working Group brings to the  program ideas about emerging scientific and technical  opportunities within the fields of geology and geophysics,  programmatic needs, and programmatic opportunities as perceived  by the wider earth science community.  The Working Group also  serves to provide feedback to the program on current logistical  and science support issues related to ongoing activities.  The  information exchange between the research community and the  Antarctic Geology and Geophysics Program, that is facilitated by  the ANTWG^3, allows the US Antarctic Program to be better  positioned to support future cutting edge geological and  geophysical research and it also promotes better information  exchange amongst investigators interested in geological and  geophysical research in the Antarctic.",
