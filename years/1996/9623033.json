 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623033  Lipton    The Principal Investigator (PI) will continue to study equilibria,   instabilities and waves in fluids and plasmas with the emphasis on the  comparative aspect of the problem. The PI is particularly interested  in the following topics: (a) stationary states of magnetized plasmas  with flow and their group-theoretical properties; (b) the stability  and evolution of elliptical self-gravitating fluid masses (the Riemann   ellipsoids) with applications to astrophysics; (c) the linear and  nonlinear dynamics of fixed-boundary ellipsoids containing fluid. The  PI is going to use various analytical techniques including the  constrained minimization, `exact' Galerkin, group-theoretical, and  geometrical optics methods in conjunction with numerical techniques  such as the three-dimensional vortex method, large scale symbolic   manipulations, and visualization, in order to achieve these goals.    Further directions of attack include self-similar, time-dependent  vortex rings, short wavelength instabilities of unmagnetized  and magnetized accretion discs, global instabilities of collisionless   gravitating systems,and spectral problems of hydrodynamics and   magnetohydrodynamics. This research will advance current knowledge of  the behavior of both laboratory and astrophysical fluids and plasmas.  In particular, this research will contribute towards a better understanding  of the properties of nonlinear PDEs of mixed elliptic/hyperbolic type   describing symmetric stationary states of plasmas with flow; the  stability of Riemann ellipsoids and fluid- and plasma-filled bodies;  the evolution of nonaxisymmetric stars, and the validity of the  fission theory of binary stars.  %%%  The dynamics of fluids and plasmas is of great interest to  mathematicians and physicists alike. There are at least two reasons  for this interest. First, fluid and plasma motions  play a fundamental role in nature and technology with applications  stretching from astrophysics, to oceanography, to weather predicti on,  to controlled thermonuclear fusion. Second, a very rich and  sophisticated mathematical apparatus is required in order to  give   an adequate description of these motions.  The equilibrium theory  studies the structure and properties of steady solutions of the  nonlinear equations of fluid and plasma dynamics. These equilibrium  solutions represent special states which do not change in time  when left undisturbed. Usually it is rather difficult to describe equilibrium  solutions, however, it is still much easier then to describe the  general solutions. In addition, equilibrium solutions are the most  interesting ones from a practical point of view. The stability theory  studies the impact of initially small perturbations on a given steady   fluid or plasma equilibrium.  An equilibrium is called stable and can  occur in nature if perturbations do not have a profound effect on its   properties.  An equilibrium is called unstable if under the influence  of perturbations  it either evolves into a different equilibrium, or  loses its steady character altogether.  Over a period of years many   classical stability problems were solved, however, several important  stability problems are still open. The wave theory studies the  behavior of small perturbations in the vicinity of stable plasma  equilibria. The main issues include the analysis of the oscillation   frequencies, the structure of the corresponding eigenfunctions, and  the asymptotic behavior of perturbations in time. The present research  is aimed at advancing current understanding of equilibria,  instabilities and waves. It blends theoretical and symbolic methods with   high-performance computing and graphics. The outcome of this research  will have both theoretical and practical value. Among other things, it  will help to understand the dynamics of plasmas in the so-called  tokamaks (installations which are used for controlled   thermonuclear fusion), and the stability of stars.  ***",
