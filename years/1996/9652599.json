We  presently lack the biological information needed to predict which  species  will go extinct or remain unaffected, and the  influence  that  these  changes have on other species and their interactions  in  an  ecosystem.  This project examines whether common features  of life history and ecology of bee species can be used to predict  their persistence or extinction in habitat fragments of different  sizes and degrees of isolation.  Most previous work in this  area  has   been  done  with  birds  and  mammals.   Bees  are  crucial  pollinators in many plant communities.  We focus on the bees that  visit  creosote bush. No plant species attracts more bee  species  (120+)  than creosote bush.  This bee fauna exhibits a  diversity  of ecological and life history features.  The plant dominates the  southwestern  deserts  of  the United  States;  its  20,000  year  advance with desertification is clearly documented by the  fossil  record.   These  attributes together provide a  model  for  other  communities  that  are  less diverse, less  understood,  or  more  difficult  to study.  Because of this shrub's broad distribution,  the  results  of this habitat fragmentation study  for  a  desert  basin  in  southern  Arizona  can  be  applied  to  regional  and  subcontinental  processes.  Combined  with  its  historic  spread  throughout  much of the western United States, the creosote  bush  and its bee guild can be used as an exemplary model for ecosystem  response to global change.",
