 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are requesting funds for the purchase of a high-performance liquid  chromatography/electrospray triple quadrupole mass spectrometer.  Acquisition of this state-of-the-art instrumentation is essential for  biological research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  The major user group is comprised of Dr. Glish, Associate Professor,  Department of Chemistry; Dr. Charles, Research Associate Professor,  Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering; Dr. Swenberg,  Professor, Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering; Dr.  Zeisel, Chair and Professor, Department of Nutrition; Dr. Frelinger,  Professor, Department of Microbiology and Dr. Smith, Assistant  Professor, School of Pharmacy.    The instrument will be used by Dr. Swenberg to investigate the  formation and repair of DNA modifications from exogenous exposure to  chemicals and endogenous processes. This research requires advances in  analytical chemistry to detect low femtomolar quantities of DNA  adducts. For this reason, Dr. Charles is investigating electrospray  mass spectrometry methods for the analysis of DNA adducts. She is also  using electrospray to identify intermediates of biological oxidation  reactions. Dr. Zeisel requires electrospray for quantitiation of  metabolites of choline and for identifying phosphatidylcholines to  characterize the transport, biosynthesis and metabolism of cholne in  mammary epithelial cells. Dr. Smith wants to quantitate known,  exogenously administered peptides in biological fluids to understand  the metabolism and disposition of peptides. Dr. Frelinger will use the  instrument for molecular weight and structural determination of  peptides and proteins. Dr. Glish intends to investigate the  electrospray and collision-induced-dissociation of proteins and  peptides. The instrument will also be available for use by other  researchers on campus pursuing research in the biological sciences,  including those identified in the proposal as minor users.    The mass spectrometer w ill be housed in the Mass Spectrometry Facility  at the University of North Carolina, located in rooms 153-156 Rosenau  Hall. The long-term objectives of the Facility are to teach students  and support research. The specific aims are to perform research which  develops solutions to analytical problems in the biological sciences;  to promote the use of mass spectrometer by active interactions with  students and faculty conducting biological research; and to provide  instruction in mass spectrometry by discussions and hands-on  experience.",
