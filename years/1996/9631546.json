In this project a preliminary investigation of  in-situ doping of AlN will be performed using a series of impurities, which are  theoretically shallow dopants, incorporated into epitaxial AlN thin films.  Initial  experiments will study Mg as an acceptor and Si as a donor impurity.  Under conditions of  strong self-compensation with native defects, other techniques such as temperature  annealing in different ambients and the use of other impurity species will be considered.  The properties of the doped AlN semiconductors will be investigated using electrical and  optical measurement techniques, X-ray diffraction, High Resolution Transmission Electron  Diffraction (HTEM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)  an  d Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). Further characterization and analysis will assess  the influence of impurities on electrical and structural properties of AlN films.  %%%  While this project will focus primarily on the study of controlled conductivity in a  potentially advantageous optoelectronic material, aluminum nitride, it will also be of  general benefit to similar properties and desirable features of group III nitrides, and  will contribute to a greater understanding of materials issues for these semiconductors.   The planning grant will aid the PI in accomplishing enough   preliminary work to show the promise of ideas or to modify    them based on the data acquired. Thus, support during the       planning period will aid the PI in preparing a more                   competitive full proposal.  ***  _",
