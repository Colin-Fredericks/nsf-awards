 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop a proof-of-concept prototype of a complex compound heating system for divers in polar regions.  The proposed heater consists of an innovative design of a compact and lightweight complex compound thermal storage unit which provides a heat output to a liquid circulating garment that is worn by a diver under a wet or dry suit.  The proposed project will result in the construction, testing and delivery of a 0.5 to 1 hour capacity complex compound heater demonstration prototype to the National Science Foundation in the six month time period.  Under Phase II of the project, an optimized heater for longer time periods (2 to 4 hours) utilizing lightweight materials will be developed, laboratory tested and field tested in conjunction with a liquid circulating garment.       The complex compound heater developed can be used by underwater search and rescue personnel and even sport divers in cold water situations.  The heater can also be applied to thermal blankets for keeping people warm in situations where electricity is not available such as in disaster areas, refugee situations, mountain rescue and ambulatory services.",
