It  will result in the creation of a virtual social environment  of social agents, with visualization and with real-time  human-computer interaction. An agent model, whose parallel  and modular structure is based on the architecture of the  primate brain, will be implemented to function interactively  and in real-time. An interface to human participants will be  implemented consisting of real-time visualization and real  time input devices including an advanced, six-degree-of  freedom tracker ball. Social agents will react to each other  socially, with their intentions observed and their  affiliative relations assessed by the other social agents.  Observed behaviors and subjective experiences of human  participants will be reported.  Although the fundamentally  social nature of people is well known, the effects and  results of this social nature in cooperating with computers  and multiple automated agents are little understood.  Affiliation, group-belonging, a sense of social solidarity,  and the attribution of intention are key in facilitating  cooperation and learning in multi-agent activity with human  participants. This project makes important first steps  toward understanding, modeling, and providing experimental  infrastructure for the study of these phenomena.    ***",
