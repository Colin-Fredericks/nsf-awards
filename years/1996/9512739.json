 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9512739  Li    This proposal requests funds to support a planning visit to  China on ecological planning for sustainable development of  urban ecosystems. The topic is an important concern for both  the U.S. and China which face rapid economic growth and  urbanization.  The need for a comprehensive ecological  analysis and modeling approach that supports sustainable  development of urban and regional systems is universal;  assuming productive relationships are established though  this project, the potential is great for both countries to  benefit.    The visit of the US PI, Dr. Bai-Lian Li of the Center for  Biosystems Modeling at Texas A&M University to the  Department of System Ecology, Research Center for Eco  Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, will  provide the opportunity for two centers with acknowledged  expertise in urban ecology and systems modeling to define a  research program.  China has large data bases collected over  a ten year period that cover environmental and socioeconomic  issues of significance for the research topic proposed.  Texas A&M's Center for Biosystems Modeling has been working  on a number of new modeling approaches such as neuro-fuzzy  based ecological risk assessment which will be further  refined through the cooperative project envisioned using the  large data bases available in China.  ***",
