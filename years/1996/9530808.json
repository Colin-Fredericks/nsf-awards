 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  research explores methods for increasing the  autonomy  and  reliability of spacecraft and space robotic systems  by  using  a  new  class  of adaptive, dynamically structured, neural networks.  Similar  to strategies observed in human adaptive motor  control,  the  networks are used to develop flexible, compact models of the  robot,  its payload, and the environment in which they  interact;  these  adaptive  models are then used to  modify  the  low  level  motion   control   program  so  as  to  ensure  efficient,   high  performance  operation.  There are three main objectives  to  the  proposed research.  The first is to extend neural control designs  for  fixed-base robots to dynamically more complex space  robotic  systems.  The second is to systematically investigate methods for  dynamically  varying the amount of computation performed  by  the  network,  attempting to simultaneously achieve  high  performance  with  minimum  complexity.  By combining techniques from  wavelet  analysis  and  nonparametric estimation with nonlinear  dynamical  stability  theory,  it is hoped to develop a general  methodology  for  designing  network  structure  adaptation  mechanisms  which  achieve  a  prespecified  complexity/performance  tradeoff.   The  final goal is to implement the resulting controllers on prototype  space  robots  operating in neutral buoyancy simulation,  and  to  evaluate their performance on baseline mission operations.",
