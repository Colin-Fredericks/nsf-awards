 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of the Chemistry Department is to provide a high-quality education for undergraduate students. The laboratory experience is a vital part of the chemistry curriculum. The incorporation of a state-of-the-art gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) instrument into the laboratory program permits the department to develop new experiments that increase the attractiveness of the chemistry program and greatly enhance the laboratory experience for both chemistry majors and nonmajors. A new Environmental Chemical Analysis course is using the GC/MS in the examination of three sets of real-world samples and employing EPA reference procedures. The GC/MS is also being used in Quantitative Organic Analysis and Instrumental Analysis courses. Students also use this instrument for research projects that enable them to investigate, characterize, and identify compounds of interest.   In summary, the goal of this project is to strengthen the undergraduate curriculum by introducing students to state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation and encouraging the pursuit of further scientific studies with GC/MS.",
