 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615822  Whitlock    This award supports a collaborative research effort to test hypotheses regarding the  occurrence of millennial-scale climate fluctuations now recognized in western North  America and the northeastern Pacific Ocean.  Preliminary data from marine  sediments off California and Oregon, pollen records from Pacific Northwest  lakes, and glacial records from western North America reveal climate events that  appear to be related to the Heinrich events of the North Atlantic.  This study will test  two hypotheses:  1)  that climate events originating in the North Atlantic are  transmitted to the North Pacific Ocean and western North America via thermohaline  circulation and its influence on surface ocean characteristics and circulation of the  atmosphere, and 2) that climates of the North Atlantic, North America, and the  northeast Pacific depend jointly on the elevation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and its  influence on atmospheric circulation.  These hypotheses will be constrained by  analyzing the paleoclimate record in a geographic array of sites in the northeastern  Pacific Ocean and in western North America.  Focus of this study will include:   constraints on oceanic upwelling and near-surface advection, deep ocean properties  and vegetation on land, and comparing these data with model output.  A significant  advance will come from linking the records from land and sea with a well-  constrained chronology, and with stratigraphic links of pollen and terrigenous  sediment in marine cores.",
