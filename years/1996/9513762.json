 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nicaraguan Sign Language arose fifteen years ago when  hundreds of previously isolated deaf individuals were brought  together in schools for the first time as the result of an  educational reform movement dedicated to providing literacy  training and a fourth-grade education to everyone. For virtually  the first time, it became possible to directly observe the  emergence of a new language. This case is particularly  interesting because this language arose not as the result of  language contact or the creolization of previously existing  languages, but rather from the merging of idiosyncratic gesture  systems, called \"home signs\" that were used for communication  within the immediate family by the first generation of deaf  children to enter the schools. Home signers quickly began to  share their idiosyncratic system imparting to the communication  system more and more conventionality. In one generation, young  children exposed to a mix of gesturing began to produce a  communication form radically different from their input. The new  form was more fluid, more complex and wholly language-like. With  no co-existing signed languages and limited access to Spanish as  a result of low literacy and inability to hear, the only source  from which this highly complex linguistic structure could have  come was the human brains of those very young first language  learners. This constitutes the cleanest case to date in support  of the proposal that humans are innately endowed with the  capacity to acquire language--even when the input is non-optimal.         This project will explore the rich source of evidence for  innate language capacity offered by the Nicaraguan case. It  begins with a systematic archiving, transcription and analysis of  the language data collected over the past ten years including  vocabulary, sentence structure, free conversation and controlled  narratives elicited via 1.5 minute nonverbal cartoons. These  cartoons are the stimuli for a population study that will  document the signi ng of the entire population of signers in  Nicaragua. The research involves several components: 1. the  population study where a variety of factors conditioning sign  fluency are considered including age, chronological year, and  amount of exposure to signing; 2. the issue of critical mass  (i.e., \"How many gesturers does it take to make a language?); 3.  the process by which a language emerges.  While addressing issues  of critical period, critical mass and the innate contribution of  the human brain to language, the project will also produce a  systematic linguistic analysis of Nicaraguan Sign Language. The  areas of focus include the \"phonetics\" of this new language, an  indepth analysis of its classifier and coreference systems, and  the coding and analysis of the use of nonmanual gestures and  facial expressions marking questions, topics, and a host of other  grammatical functions.",
