 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522932  Doran       To stimulate interest and activity in mathematical research,  the National Science   Foundation each year supports a number of NSF-CBMS Regional  Research Conferences   in the Mathematical Sciences.  Each five-day conference features  a distinguished lecturer   who delivers ten lectures on a topic of important current  research in one sharply focused   area of the mathematical sciences.  The lecturer subsequently  prepares an expository   monograph based upon these lectures, which is normally published  by the American   Mathematical Society or the Society for Industrial and Applied  Mathematics, or jointly by   the American Statistical Association and the Institute of  Mathematical Statistics.  Certain   features differentiate these conferences from typical research  conferences.  These are: (1)   Focus on a single important and timely area of research by a  leading practitioner, (2)   Continued effect and local stimulation through regional emphasis,  (3) Panel review for   quality, breadth, and timeliness, and (4) Published monographs  for a wider audience.        This project will support an NSF-CBMS Regional Research  Conference in the   Mathematical Sciences on Euler Products and Eisenstein Series on  Symplectic and   Metaplectic Groups to be held May 19-24, 1996 at Texas Christian  University.  Professor   Goro Shimura of Princeton University will be the principal  lecturer.",
