Although such change is normal and healthy, increasingly the impetus for change comes from lack of growth in support for faculty research by Federal agencies joined with increased emphasis on teaching and changing patterns of employment among graduates.  Recent and rapid development of electronic information storage and exchange provide another important impetus.  The workshop will bring together faculty, administrators and students to provide information about the effects of these and other factors, and on the kinds of change in government and university practices that are appropriate responses.   ***",
