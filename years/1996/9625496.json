 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS 96-25496  Eubank  Problems of inference for parametric and nonparametric regression are investigated.  Tests of goodness-of-fit for parametric regression models are proposed that derive from the comparison of parametric and nonparametric estimators.  This is accomplished for rather general models that include generalized linear and time series models.  New methods are developed for analytic, asymptotic comparison of these nonparametric type tests through the use of intermediate asymptotic efficiency.  These testing ideas are extended to more general goodness-of-fit problems, such as testing for additivity, where the null model is even nonparametric. Other inference problems are also studied, including several proposals for the construction of asymptotically valid confidence intervals for nonparametric regression that have good finite sample properties.    It is often reasonable to believe in many areas of science, such as biology, engineering, psychology, etc., that the data being collected is produced by two components: a nonrandom component, representing a characteristic of nature common to all individuals or subjects, and a random component that accounts for individual variation.  The nonrandom component represents the reproducible or predictable aspect of the phenomenon being studied and is therefore of considerable interest. In many cases, from theoretical considerations or past experience, one can postulate a mathematical framework or model that is believed to describe the nonrandom component. When such models are correct they can provide useful summary and predictive tools. However, an incorrect model can lead to misleading conclusions and inaccurate predictions of future events. Thus, it is important to have methodology for assessing the accuracy of postulated models for data. This research focuses on the development of new tools for this purpose that rely on the comparison of two types of estimators for the nonrandom component: namely, an estimator that is computed under the assumpt ion that the postulated model is correct and a very flexible estimator that does not employ this assumption. The theoretical statistical issues that are addressed in this work include the development of objective criteria for comparing the two estimators and the determination of values for these criteria which indicate that the data does not support a postulated model. Other problems that are considered include the use of the data to construct intervals that have a known, specified, chance of containing the unknown, nonrandom component of the data.",
