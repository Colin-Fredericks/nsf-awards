 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    Zeh  9514245    Theoretical models generally portray sexual selection as a  constant, undirectional         force, driving a population  towards a single, optimal male phenotype.  Species are  assumed to occupy homogeneous environments and to experience  selection either through male competition or through mate  choice by monogamous females.  This view fails to explain  why sexually-selected male characters are often precisely  those which exhibit the greatest variability, perhaps  because the models do not reflect the complexity of factors  influencing trait evolution in nature.  Many species,  particularly those that exploit ephemeral resources, are  subject to fluctuating environmental conditions.  In  addition, DNA fingerprinting has revealed that multiple  paternity, and hence polyandry, is far more common than  previously assumed.    The research proposed here will test the hypothesis that  sperm storage by polyandrous females, superimposed on male  competition in a heterogeneous environment, can contribute  to the maintenance of variability in male sexually-selected  characters by carrying genotypes through episodes of  unfavorable selection.  The development of single-locus  minisatellite DNA probes for a species whose natural history  and reproductive biology are highly amenable to  experimentation makes the neotropical pseudoscorpion,  Cordylochernes scorpioides, a model system for testing this  hypothesis.  As an essential first step in carrying out a  rigorous test of the  sperm-storing females as carriers of  male genetic variability  hypothesis, the proposed research  will determine whether all the elements of this model are  present in the C. scorpioides system.  First, to assess  whether sexual selection favors a significantly smaller male  phenotype within trees than on beetles, DNA fingerprinting  will be used to quantify the relationship between male size  and reproductive success in experimental tree populations.  Second, to assess the ca pacity of females to act as carriers  of male variability, DNA fingerprinting will be used to  compare levels of multiple paternity in the broods of  females captured in the act of boarding and of disembarking  from beetles.  In addition, sperm utilization patterns will  be investigated in a semi-natural experimental simulation of  a dispersal episode.  Finally, to assess the potential for  exaggerated male traits to respond to selection in the two  environments, the design of the within-tree sexual selection  experiment will provide field estimates of heritability  based on paternity assignment and son/sire regression  involving field-caught males (sires)and their male offspring  recaptured after release and development to maturity in the  field.  Assuming that all the elements necessary for the  model are found to exist in this pseudoscorpion system, the  development of quantitative simulation models to investigate  how selection in the two environments may be balanced will  be the focus of future research.",
