My revised budgets are  making their way through our process and will get to you soon; my abstract   in non-technical language is below.  Revise away as you think best - and I   would appreciate feedback on how to do this (important) task better.         On a technical note - I take the panel's recommendation not to use  Century as the sole vehicle for integration - but I don't think writing our   own model for these systems is a very productive approach.  What I hope to   do is use what we learn here to affect how people in general model these   processes; tying it to Century is limiting, developing our own model that's   \"best\" for these systems is even more so...         And - the summary:         Soil fertility controls plant production and many other aspects of   ecosystems.  Nitrogen and phosphorus are the most important of the nutrients   governing soil fertility, and both the nature of ecosystems and their responses   to natural and human-caused change differ depending on whether nitrogen or   phosphorus is in the shortest supply.  This research is designed to determine   how interactions between the cycles of nitrogen and phosphorus control plant   production in ecosystems, and with what consequences.  It makes use of a set  of forests in Hawaii that range in soil age from 300 to 4,100,000 year.  Most   factors, including tree species, are constant on this sequence, but fertility   on young soils is controlled by nitrogen, while that on old soils is phosphorus   controlled.  The sites thus facilitate our understanding of the basic processes   that regulate soil fertility and its consequences.            And I'll be happy to take another crack at it, if appropriate.  With  best wishes,     Peter Vitousek",
