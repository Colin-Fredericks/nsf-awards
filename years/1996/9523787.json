He will continue research on the physical mechanisms of  Quaternary glaciations.  Simple and intermediate models of these  mechanisms will be developed further, including zero-, one-, two-  and three dimensional models of the paleoceanic thermohaline  circulation (THC), in addition to the previously-modeled radiation  balance, ice-sheet mass balance, and hydrologic cycle.  Model  results will be compared in the spectral and temporal domain with  marine, ice-core and continental records, emphasizing rapid  variations associated with marine Heinrich and ice-core Dansgaard-  Oeschger events, and their spatial patterns.    2. Research on the low-frequency variability of the atmosphere,  emphasizing intraseasonal oscillations in the midlatitude  atmosphere, has proceeded through theoretical studies with a  hierarchy of simple and intermediate models, observational studies  of the longest upper-air datasets, and studies using the UCLA  general circulation model.  The PI shall complete this research  with a direct comparison of intermediate-model, GCM, and  observational-analysis results.  A laboratory study of barotropic  flow over topography should also shed further light on the  oscillations' physical mechanisms.    3. Natural climate variability on the interdecadal time scale is  the third, and new area of research.  Preliminary, univariate  studies of instrumental records will be extended to explore this  variability's spatial patterns.  Two- and three-dimensional THC  models will be coupled with active and passive atmospheric and sea-  ice models.  These models will be studied first for constant  radiative forcing and then for different scenarios of changes in  this forcing, due to solar variability, volcanic eruptions and  greenhouse-gas increases.  The interaction of these long-periodic,  intermittent or g radual changes with those caused by the short-  periodic annual cycle will be examined carefully.    All three thrusts of the investigation are aimed at clarifying the  interaction between the climatic system's natural variability -  intraseasonal, interdecadal or millennial - and the variable  forcing: external to the atmosphere, in the intraseasonal case, and  to the climate system as a whole, in the other two.  The tools to  be used are those of dynamical systems theory, for the model  studies, and of nonparametric statistics, for the model diagnostics  and data analysis.  Ultimately, the proposed research should  improve our understanding of the factors that contribute to or  limit the system's predictability on each one of the three time  scales under consideration.",
