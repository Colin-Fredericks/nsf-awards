 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN:  9634421  PI:  Wachtel    The overall OBJECTIVE of this project is to utilize engineering  based \"enabling technologies\" to better understand of neural (brain)   function.  In particular, we will address the issue of how neural sensory   systems are able to detect very weak signals in the presence of large   amounts of background \"noise\".   Our prototype will be the electroreceptive   systems of sharks, (who are able to detect an electric field equivalent to   a 1.5 volt \"flashlight battery\" placed across the Atlantic Ocean!)  The   possible mechanisms by which this exquisite sensory system operates will be   explored using technologies such as Interactive Computer Simulation and   Digital Signal Processing models adapted from electrical and computer   engineering venues.    The SIGNIFICANCE of this project will extend far beyond  understanding how sharks detect very weak electric fields. First of all, it   will allow us to demonstrate how \"engineering based\" technologies can be   usefully deployed in studying the nervous system.  Such technologies may   play a vital role, during and after the \"decade of the brain\", in helping   us understand how the brain operates as an information detector and   processor.  In addition to its fundamental value in neurobiology, such an   understanding could lead to the evolution of improved computers -   particularly those based on \"neural network\" designs.  The ability to   detect and interpret weak signals is also of vital importance in developing   advanced communication systems and understanding the way \"nature\" has been   accomplishing this for millions of years is likely to be extremely   relevant.",
