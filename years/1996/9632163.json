 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major objective of the proposed research is to develop an understanding of the evolutionary  origins of morphological differences among tamarin species (genus Saguinus).  Tamarins are a  highly diverse group of New World Monkeys inhabiting Amazonia and the north coast of South  America into Panama.  They display a wide range of cranial morphologies.  Using previously  gathered information on patterns of inheritance of skull form and the phylogenetic relationships  among the species, the researchers will test a series of hypotheses concerning the evolutionary  origin of morphological differences in this group.  The studies will serve as a model for  analyzing morphological diversity in primate radiations.  First, they will test the hypothesis that  cranial variability arose by random evolutionary processes, such as genetic drift or randomly  varying natural selection.  If this hypothesis is not rejected, it is possible that the diversity  observed did not arise by special adaptation to specific environments.  Next they will use a  well-resolved phylogenetic tree to create a series of phylogenetically-independent contrasts  among sister groups.  They will describe each of these contrasts using a two-group discriminant  function standardized with an estimate of the within-species genetic covariance matrix.  Each of  these discriminant functions represents the pattern of differences in natural selection required to  produce the observed morphological differences between related groups of tamarins.  The results  will be interpreted using the principles of functional morphology.  Specific a priori hypotheses,  such as selection on overall size as a source of evolutionary morphological divergence, will also  be tested.",
