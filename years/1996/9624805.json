 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on the synthesis of syringolides and syringolide   analogs,  compounds of a type known to trigger disease resistance in   plants.   These synthetic molecules will be used to isolate and   structurally characterize their receptor proteins.  The ultimate goal is   the molecular cloning of the resistance gene responsible for producing   the receptor protein.  The research has important potential for   developing new methods of crop protection.   The educational plan focuses   on undergraduate course development.  With this CAREER award, the   Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research and educational   activities of Dr. John L. Wood of the Department of Chemistry at Yale   University.  Professor Wood will focus his research efforts on   understanding microbial-plant signal transduction as well as the   biochemical events leading to the hypersensitive response mechanism of   plant defenses.  The work has important potential for the agricultural   industry.   Dr. Wood's  educational plan focuses on course development at   the undergraduate level.",
