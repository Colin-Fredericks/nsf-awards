 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program provides continued support to work by Dr. Robert G. Bergman of   the Chemistry Department, University of California at Berkeley, on   reactions of organic molecules with transition metal complexes.  One area   of investigation is the synthesis of new complexes containing two metals   located in close proximity to one another.  Specifically targeted are   systems that are unsymmetrical, due to either the presence of two metals   with very different electronic properties or to the presence of different   reactive ligands at each metal center.  Research on these materials will   focus on reactions that are applicable to the chemical utilization of   small organic molecules, such as alkenes, alkynes and carbon dioxide, and   to the type of transformations important in organic synthesis, such as   carbon-carbon or carbon-heteroatom bond formation.  A second area of   investigation is the generation of organometallic species that are highly   reactive due to the presence of an unpaired electron at the metal center,   that is, organometallic free radicals, and capable of forming a   relatively strong covalent bond to the metal.   Also,  methods for the   abstraction of protons from relatively unacidic metal hydrides will be   developed  in order to generate very nucleophilic, low valent anionic   metal complexes.   Much is known about organometallic reactions that take place in   even-electron complexes that contain a single metal center with easily   accessible charges and oxidation states. This project moves beyond these   areas of investigation to obtain understanding of reaction details in   cases involving an odd-number of electrons, uncommon metal oxidation   states, or  more than one metal center.  The results will increase   understanding of reactions which are relevant to chemical manufacturing",
