 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for a project concerned primarily  with long range behavior of various types of combinatorial  systems, especially graphs, hypergraphs of fixed edge size, and  matroids. A common theme is that such behavior is surprisingly  nice in important ways, and that this is often because there is a  substantial amount of approximate independence in appropriate  probability spaces associated with the system in question. The  project thus seeks to understand both properties of said  probability spaces and their consequences for combinatorial  problems.The heart of the  project is concerned with asymptotic  normality and related issues. Roughly, the investigator seeks to  show that various combinatorially-defined  random variables are  always approximately normally distributed in the  absence of  trivial obstructions to such behavior. Recent work of the   investigator suggests the possibility of such a phenomenon in  some  surprisingly general and unstructured situations. It is  hoped that  satisfactory answers to some of these questions,  involving so-called \"canonical\" or \"hard-core\" distributions,  will support new directions in the development of the powerful  probabilistic method of combinatorics,  which seeks to apply  probabilistic ideas to resolve non-random combinatorial problems.  This work also opens new possibilities for the interplay between  probability and questions about the relation between integer  programming problems and their associated linear relaxations. We  may take asymptotic agreement of integer and linear optima as a  definition of nice \"long range behavior\" since linear programming  problems are computationally tractable and integer programs are  generally intractable. Then, very roughly, a good solution to the  linear version of a problem gives a  \"canonical distribution\"  which can be used to randomly generate or prove  existence of a  good solution to the original problem. This idea is thought to  have considerable potential.    This research is in t he general  area of Combinatorics. One of the goals of Combinatorics is to  find efficient methods to study how discrete collections of  objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is  extremely  important to modern communications. For example, the  design of large  networks, such as those occurring in telephone  systems, and the design of  algorithms in computer science deal  with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of  combinatorial research.",
