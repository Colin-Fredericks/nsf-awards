 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Katharine Covert, Department of Chemistry, West Virginia University,   Morgantown, West Virginia, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic,   and Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division and by the   Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) for   studies of the synthesis of antimony allyls and oxo-allyls.  A class of   antimony allyls with sterically demanding alkoxides will be prepared.    Oxidition and transfer studies of the allyl fragments with molybdenum,   tin, and vanadium will be performed. Dr. Covert's group will also   synthesize and resolve chiral antimony allyls, and they will survey their   reactivity in allyl transfer and oxidation reactions.  The education   component of this project concentrates on large general chemistry courses   with a focus on student retention and development, and takes advantage of   the synergism between research and teaching.  This project addresses the synthesis of a series of antimony complexes   containing both a reactive organic fragment, known as an allyl, and a   series of bulky substituents, known as alkoxides. The combination of   these bulky substituents with antimony provide the opportunity to control   the reactivity of the allyl fragment, and to understand commercial   processes which utilize antimony catalysts to perform the oxidation of   small organic molecules such as propene and propane.  Fundamental studies   of the synthesis of these compounds and the oxidation and transfer of the   allyl fragments will be performed.",
