 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marquez-Magana  96-00932  The overall objective of this Career Development Plan is to create a balanced (50/50) effort between research and teaching.  In this way the principal investigator (P.I.) intends to serve the community  as a role model for students considering a career in science.  The proposed research activities focus on the molecular and genetic characterization of the fla/che operon, a large flagellar transcription unit in Bacillus subtilis, and the regulation of its expression.  Although much of the DNA that makes up the fla/che transcription unit has been cloned, sequenced, and characterized genetically, the promoter element(s) that initiates its transcription has not been identified.  Additionally , the 3' end of the operon has not been characterized.  Molecular and genetic analysis of the fla/che operon will not only increase our knowledge of flagellar gene expression in B. subtilis, but will contribute to our understanding of flagellar regulons in many different organisms where homologous regulons appear to exist.  Part of these research activities have been incorporated into a course that the a P.I. has developed.  As a faculty member, the goal of the P.I. is to foster the excitement of scientific discovery in undergraduate and graduate students at San Francisco State University (SFSU), and to empower them with the tools to pursue a successful career in science.  The specific objectives are to:   Utilize microbial genetic techniques for the molecular analysis of the fla/che      operon of Bacillus subtilis:  Characterize transcription initiation sites  Clone and study the 3' end of operon  Screen for and analyze regulatory mutants of the fla/che operon    Empower undergraduate and graduate students with the knowledge and    technology of molecular genetic approaches:  Introduce undergraduate students to the power of genetic engineering  Train graduate students in microbial genetics methodology    3.  Recruit and mentor minority undergraduate and graduate students in the                                      fields of microbial genetics and molecular biology:   Participate in institutional and community programs that reach out to        minority students  Mentor minority students undertaking independent research    These objectives are firmly supported by both the Department of Biology and tip-level administrators at San Francisco State University.  Faculty in the Department of Biology believe strongly that an active research program provides students with the opportunity to gain first hand experience in how science operates and gives them skills not attainable in a traditional classroom setting.  Additionally, the university at large is committed to the eduation of the ethnically diverse Bay Area population.",
