 "awd_abstract_narration": "The philosophy of the Panola College Interdisciplinary Technology Center project revolves around the idea that it takes faculty from all disciplines working together to educate each student. A problem being faced by the institution is that academic populations often become compartmentalized and disinterested in other disciplines. The project is developing technology based cross-curriculum lessons in the academic foundation courses by building on experiences in physics and English which introduce students to both technology and other disciplines. The interdisciplinary lessons and activities simultaneously expose the diverse population of students to a technology education and to the connections between disciplines that make for a whole education.     Goals are being achieved by establishing a resource and activity center with open access to the latest instructional technology for the faculty and students of Panola College. Faculty are developing curricular materials and revising all classes to include technological applications. The Center allows simultaneous use by structured and unstructured groups involved in varied activities, so students learn different applications.    Outcomes include improved faculty cooperation across science and other disciplines, a more computer- and technology-literate student body, a more involved and interrelated curriculum, a more progressive faculty, and a program of workforce training more appropriate for the job markets students will face.",
