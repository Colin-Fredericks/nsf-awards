 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630442  Berenbaum    Cytochrome  P450  monooxygenases  are  enzymes  involved  in  the  metabolism  of  foreign  compounds  in  organisms  ranging   from  bacteria   to   humans.    Despite  their   virtually   universal  distribution,  little is known about the functional  significance  of  variation  in  these  enzymes.   This  gap  in  knowledge  is  particularly acute with respect to P450s in insects, despite  the  importance of these enzymes in the metabolism of plant toxins  as  well as insecticides.  In the tiger swallowtail, Papilio glaucus,  CYP6B4  is  known to metabolize furanocoumarins, plant  secondary  substances  that are toxic to a wide variety of insects.   Unlike  its  relatives,  which  feed  exclusively  on  plants  containing  furanocoumarins,  the tiger swallowtail almost  never  encounters  these   toxins  in  its  host  plants.   In  this  project,   the  investigators  will  examine  variation  in  the  structure   and  function  of  CYP6B4  in  relation to the  frequency  with  which  furanocoumarins  are  encountered  in  the  diet  of  the   tiger  swallowtail.   By examining variation in enzyme function  in  the  presence  and absence of naturally occurring toxins, we  hope  to  gain  insight  into  the  process by which plant-feeding  insects  develop the metabolic capability to feed on toxic plants as  well  as  into  the process by which cytochrome P450s assume importance  in  the  acquisition  of  resistance to  insecticides  and  other  synthetic toxins.",
