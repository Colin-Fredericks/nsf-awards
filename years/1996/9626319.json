It is   expected to contribute in the areas of  Multivariate Splines, Multivariate   Polynomial Interpolation, Radial Basis Function Approximation, Wavelets,   and Gabor Expansions.  The first topic concerns polynomial interpolation.    Several years ago, the proposers came up with a scheme that assigns, to any   data on any finite discrete pointset in several dimensions, a polynomial   interpolant of least possible degree, and with various other desirable   properties. It is proposed to develop an error formula for  that scheme, in   preparation for its application in cubatures or in the construction of   trivariate finite elements. The second topic deals with applications of the   theory of approximation from shift-invariant spaces, a theory that was   developed by the proposers and others.  One suggested application, of a   theoretical  nature, but pertinent to wavelets, explores the (surprising)   connection between the smoothness of functions in a refinable space and the   approximation orders provided by such a space.  Another, very unexpected,   application of shift-invariant space theory is in the area of approximation to   scattered data from the span of translates of a radial basis function. The   suggested approach is based on a new conversion formula that allows the   extension of many approximation schemes on uniform grids to general   grids.  The last topic deals with the representation of functions in one or   more variables via  decomposition/reconstruction techniques.  A thorough   understanding  reached in prior research on general shift-invariant systems   is now used in the constructions of new wavelet and Gabor systems.    Special attention is given to exploiting the freedom offered by the   redundancy inherent in oversampled systems.    Computer solutions of physical problems (including the problems to be   att acked by high performance computing) require a description of the   various physical aspects of the problem in the only language a computer   understands, namely numbers. The resulting mathematical description (of a   car door or the human heart, of pictures taken from a  satellite,  of the   moisture content of air as a function of longitude, latitude and height above   sea level, etc.) is of necessity inexact, and this makes it very important to   develop efficient methods of representation, i.e., methods of acceptable   accuracy and using not too many numbers. The proposal concerns the   development of such methods (for  descriptions involving several   parameters) and of means for ascertaining their accuracy and efficiency.",
