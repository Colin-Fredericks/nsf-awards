 "awd_abstract_narration": "9634498  Smith    The focus of this work is the development of methodologies for  the modeling and identification of dynamically uncertain systems  in a closed-loop control configuration.  The work has a strong  experimental component, in addition to the theoretical work  required to develop the framework.  The experiments serve as  testbeds for the theoretical and algorithmic work, and addition,  contribute to the development of feedback control technology  within each of their application areas.  A chemical vapor  deposition system for semiconductor (GaAs/InP) growth is used as  a closed-loop control and modeling testbed.  The issues raised by  this experiment include: uncertain flow dynamics; process  nonlinearities; highly uncertain reaction dynamics; and model  based sensing using optical measurements.  A magnetic bearing  experiment is also studied.  A rotor shaft is levitated at each  end by magnetic bearings.  This is a particularly difficult  identification and control problem and the relevant issues  include: closed-loop identification of a multiple-input,  multiple-output, unstable system; uncertain resonant modes in the  rotor shaft; and rotor rotation dependent coupling between  control loops.  The third experiment is a radiant thermal  processing system, consisting of an array of lamps for the  heating of a plate.  The issues involved here are: modeling of an  infinite dimensional system; variable interaction between lamps;  and significant uncertainty in the plate characteristics  (emissivity, thermal coefficients).  The theoretical side of the  project is based on a robust control modeling framework.  Uncertainty in the system dynamics is modeled by bounded  perturbations to a nominal model.  Prior work in the area of  model validation has developed computationally tractable  techniques for assessing the minimum size of the perturbations  required to adequately describe an experimental observation.  We  propose extending the approach to develop methodologies for the  experimental  identification of model parameters for perturbed  models.  ***",
