The   Research Center would consist of the following core institutions:  CIMA,   the Center for Marine and Atmospheric Research of the University of Buenos   Aires in Argentina; CPTEC, the Center for Weather Prediction and Climate   Studies of the National Space Research Institute of Brazil; the Cooperative   Institute for Climate Studies of the University of Maryland; and the   Cooperative Institute for Research in the Environmental Sciences of NOAA in   Colorado.  This proposal explicitly includes participants from Argentina, Brazil, and   the United States.  The workshop will also include other participants from   Uruguay and Paraguay.
