The research component is aimed at  understanding how microscopic structural and dynamic effects  at solid/fluid interfaces impact macroscopic fluid flows.  Of particular interest are flows involving the spreading of  fluid on a solid substrate.  Such flows are ubiquitous in  nature and are encountered in many important manufacturing  processes.   Examples include coating, fabrication of  metal/ceramic composites and containment of molten alloys.  To model these systems a new computational method will be  developed.  The method will link a molecular dynamics  simulation in the vicinity of the solid interface with a  continuum model on larger length scales.  By using a  molecular dynamics simulation near the solid, the detailed  flow can be modeled without imposing phenomenological  boundary conditions.  By using a continuum description such  as the Navier-Stokes equations away from the solid, the flow  at experimental length scales can be resolved.  This  discrete-continuum hybrid computation in and of itself  represents an important advance in simulational techniques.    Integrated with this research is a teaching program that  includes the development of a multidisciplinary curriculum  on computer simulation of systems at the molecular/particle  level.  Interesting results from research in molecular  hydrodynamics and computational materials science will be  integrated into the undergraduate curriculum in fluids and  thermodynamics.  %%%  This is a CAREER grant which integrates research and  education activities.
