 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed at the development of a network of miniaturized, intelligent, addressable sensing modules (ASM's), that can be embedded within a composite structure, remotely powered, and interrogated by a personal computer through a non-contacting inductive link.  The inductive power link is also used for bi-directional communications.  A computer based interrogation system will transmit a data request to a specific ASM on the embedded network.  This data request will be encoded by frequency shift keying the AC waveform that delivers power to embedded electronics.  Once addressed, the embedded ASM will power up its strain sensing elements, and data conversion components.  The strain data will be sampled and encoded as pulse code modulated (PCM) data.  The PCM serial data then modulates an RF carrier for transmission out of the embedded material, back to the interrogating computer.  The system will be designed to allow a variety of sensing devices to be used interchangeably on the network, this will allow smart structures sensing means to be tailored for a specific application.  Development of the system will be accompanied by thorough testing along the way to insure target specifications will be met.       Structures with a broad variety of capabilities may be developed by embedding intelligent sensing networks of temperature, strain, crack propagation, pressure, magnetic fields, etc.  Applications include health monitoring of thick composite structures, bridges, dams, and buildings.  Military and commercial potential for these systems is significant.",
