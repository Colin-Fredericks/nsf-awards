 "awd_abstract_narration": "9624542  Morrison    The ability to study old stellar populations in galaxies, the  results of which may be used to trace the formation and evolution  of galaxies, has benefited in several ways from the advent of  large-format Charge-Coupled-Devices (CCDs) and increased  computing power.  A major advance has been the development of  techniques of using deep CCD imaging of galaxies, which allows  one to study the old stellar populations of nearby galaxies in  unprecedented detail. The observations to be carried out will  reach more than 2 magnitudes fainter than previous observations.    The results of the research will serve to delineate the older  stellar populations of a representative sample of nearby disk  galaxies, using  recently developed techniques.  A systematic  investigation of the properties of 10 nearby edge-on disk  galaxies with Hubble types ranging from Sc though Sa to S0 will  be carried out.  Of particular interest in this work are the  properties of thick disks and stellar halos of these galaxies,  when they exist.  The study of the thick disks observed in the  sample will able one to test the currently popular models of  thick disk galaxy formation by satellite accretion. If the models  predict successfully the thick disk properties of this sample,  there is the possibility of using thick disks as tracers of the  accretion history of galaxies.  The characterization of thick  disks and halos in this sample will allow us to test for the  first time whether the Milky Way's old stellar populations are  typical of nearby disk galaxies.    Most of the observations will be taken on Case Western Reserve  University's (CWRU) Burrell Schmidt telescope at Kitt Peak Natal  Observatory (KPNO), to which CWRU has special access.  An  improved CCD system for the Schmidt, with a factor of 5  improvement in quantum efficiency, will be purchased.  This  upgrade of the CCD system will enable surface photometry  observations in the blue region of the spectrum, and thus provide  color (and hence a ge and metallicity) information on the thick  disk and halo stellar populations.    Teaching development activities will include involvement of  undergraduate students in research and in course development of  the \"Introduction to Astronomy for Majors\" course.  This will  closely tie what is taught to current research, using a thematic  approach.  Two major areas of current astronomical research, how  the solar system was formed and the determination of the value of  cosmic distance scale problem, will be used as recurring themes  in the two-semester course. Other teaching-related activities  will include several innovative ways of improving teaching,  organized through CWRU's new teaching center (including active  learning techniques and a strong use of the World Wide Web).  A  program to allow undergraduates to accompany the PI on observing  trips to KPNO will be carried out.  ***",
