 "awd_abstract_narration": "9633346  Glicksman    This study is directed toward developing a firm experimental  basis and deeper understanding of microstructural evolution  in two-phase alloys.  The focus is to integrate and test  several theories that describe microstructural coarsening  kinetics.  Specifically, \"snap-shot\" calculations, based on  distributions of point sources and sinks to represent  diffusional interactions in dilute microstructures, are  extended to higher volume fractions.  Kinetic studies on  binary alloys are pursued which are found to exhibit  temporal exponents in ultra-dense microstructures that,  curiously, decrease from the classical Ostwald ripening  value of 1/3 to a value of 1/4.  This is attributed to an as  yet unexplained kinetic behavior from the influence of  particle shape accommodation and strong spatial  correlations.  In summary, the research focuses both  theoretical and experimental efforts on integrating and  validating fundamental elements of coarsening theory to  achieve progress toward a more unified kinetic description  of microstructure evolution over the volume fraction range 0-  1.  %%%  The core subjects of this grant include determining kinetic  laws for alloys processed over the full range of  compositions and explaining them through basic kinetic  principles.  Properties of metal alloys depend on their microstructure,  and the microstructural behavior depends primarily on time,  temperature, and composition.  Temperature controls the rate  of atom diffusion, whereas, at a fixed temperature, the  average chemical composition determines the volume fraction  of dispersed phases, and, indirectly, establishes the  microstructural length scales for diffusion and interfacial  processes.  ***",
