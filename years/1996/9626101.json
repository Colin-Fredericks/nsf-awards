The most pressing of these concern  the nonresolvable homology manifolds discovered by the investigator,  J. Bryant, W. Mio, and S. Weinberger.  Simply put, the main project is  to discover to what extent the classical geometric theory of  topological manifolds carries over to these newly discovered spaces.  This study is closely related to the well-known Borel and Bing-Borsuk  Conjectures.  Other problems on the investigator's list of projects  include the construction of controlled Gamma-surgery theory and its  application to the study of topological embeddings in codimension two,  the construction of manifold structures on acyclic Poincare duality  spaces, the study of ``short'' maps defined on ``large'' Riemannian  manifolds, and applications of controlled topology to the study of  spaces of Riemannian manifolds.       Much of topology is concerned with the study of mathematical objects  called spaces.  The surface of a sphere is a space, as is the surface  of a donut.  In the study of mathematical systems with many variables,  it is common for spaces of very high or even infinite dimension to  play important roles.  A classical problem in topology is to find small  checkable sets of axioms which characterize particular spaces.  One  popular set of axioms involves the notion of connectivity.  Roughly  speaking, a space is connected if it is all in one piece.  It is  locally connected if it can be chopped up into arbitrarily small  connected pieces.  (Be warned -- these plain English definitions are at  best rough approximations to the actual mathematical definitions.)  In 1978, James Cannon made an amazingly perceptive conjecture.  He  conjectured that if a space satisfied certain generalized connectivity  axioms and had enough room in it to push certain sets apart, then it  was a topological manifold -- a space which is assembled by gluing  together small pieces of ordi nary Euclidean space.  (Both the surface  of a sphere and the surface of a donut are topological manifolds of  dimension 2.  The ``curved spaces'' appearing in general relativity are  topological manifolds of dimension 4.)  Combining work of F. Quinn and  R. D. Edwards shows that Cannon's conjecture is true whenever a  connected space contains even the tiniest manifold piece.  This  manifold piece acts as a sort of seed which determines the entire local   structure of the space.  Working with J. Bryant, W. Mio, and S. Weinberger,   the investigator has shown that Cannon's conjecture is not true in complete  generality.  The main question the investigator will be studying is whether   the ``seeding'' phenomenon from the Edwards-Quinn case holds in general --   whether the local structure of connected counterexamples is the same at   every point.  If this turns out to be true, these new spaces could become  objects of interest paralleling manifolds.  Cannon's axioms guarantee  that from a large-scale point of view, these spaces look exceedingly  like manifolds.  If the seeding phenomenon holds, one imagines that  there could eventually be theories speculating that we live in one of  these new mathematical objects rather than in ``ordinary'' Euclidean  space.  ***",
