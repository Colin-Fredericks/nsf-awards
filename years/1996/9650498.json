 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests  funds for equipment and software to improve laboratory activities in four courses in Cognitive and Linguistic Science and to transform the present laboratory, which can serve only a small number of students from these classes,  into a virtual laboratory that will be accessible to the growing numbers of students from their dormitories and other sites on campus. Space and equipment will continue to be reserved for close, direct use and supervision on site.  Two Unix workstations are central to the project, one to serve as a gateway to the campus-wide ethernet network and the other to serve as the working laboratory computer and storage node for speech and visual data.  In addition, five Powermacs and six PCs provide students with access to the laboratory and instructional software native to those systems and remote connections to the Unix workstations.  Improvements supported by the equipment include computer-assisted programs in language analysis, graphic illustration of speech mechanisms during articulation, instruction in semantics and logic via Tarski's World, experience with design and data  analysis using interactive design programs, instruction in parsing via neural net programs, and instruction in and manipulation of canonical findings in vision via Visionlab and the Active Eye.",
