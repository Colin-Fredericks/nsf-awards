This will partially cover the expenses of speakers   and participating students and faculty who do not have grants. The  principal lecturer will be Professor Paul Fife of the University of   Utah, who will speak on \"Mathematical issues in the dynamics of   phase transitions\". The lectures, with their accompanying miniconference,   will bring lively interactions among scientists in applied analysis,   modeling and computation in material science and mathematical biology,   statistical physics as well as geometry. The conference will bring   mathematics of the highest quality to faculty and students from not   only at Tulane but also from Louisiana universities.    %%%  This proposal calls for support to organize a week long conference,  historically known as the Clifford Lecture series. The purpose of the   lecture series is to bring together researchers from many different fields  who have a common intersection on phase transition which is an active  area in the theoretical material science, statistical physics as   well as geometry. The topics to be covered represent some current   technological issues in phase transition. The theme of the workshop   includes a principal lecturer, followed by a mini conference. Student   participation is a strong component of the lecture series.  ***",
