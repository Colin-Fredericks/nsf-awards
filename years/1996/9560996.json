 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on the fundamental problem with the application of force feedback in immersive environments, which is immobility. The problem is addresssed by proposing an extreme innovation in force feedback technology: hand-held, spatially unrestricted force feedback. The state of-the-art in force feedback devices are table mounted. These devices require mounting to generate leverage for forces/torques and to support large masses. Consequently, no existing force feedback devices allow mobility and force generation concurrently. This is a fundamental problem since many virtual reality applications require large working volumes and the ability to move freely within the volumes. Currently, the most immersive virtual reality systems provide realistic visual and audio feedback during walk through scenarios. These large environments lack one primary component, haptic feedback, primarily because the current technology will not support unrestricted motion. The proposed innovation is fundamental for the use of force feedback in future human-computer interactions, better known as virtual reality.       The development of the proposed innovation will have significant commercial success. Immersive force feedback has lagged behind other virtual reality technologies such as visualization and tracking. The proposed project will advance force feedback such that it can easily be integrated with existing commercial applications.",
