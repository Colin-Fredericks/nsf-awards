The one-dimensional evolution exhibits remarkable   dynamical wealth, while there are indications of its essentially   finite-dimensional character. The existence of a finite-dimensional   attractor and nonlinear interaction of two free boundaries in a   degenerate Hopf bifurcation will be investigated analytically and   numerically. The Principal Investigator will also study two-dimensional   evolution generated by these free interface problems. A rigorous study   concerning well-posedness for problems with various boundary conditions      and interface kinetics shall be combined with  numerical simulation in   order to understand geometry and dynamics of the curved interfaces. An   alternative view of the interface dynamics is provided by   coordinate-free surface evolution equations modeling basic flame   instabilities which include the thermal-diffusive and the hydrodynamic   instabilities. Analytical and numerical study of the surface evolution   equations will be directed toward better understanding of their basic   mathematical nature, such as global well-posedness, uniformly bounded   curvature and smoothness of solutions, and some important dynamical   features including exponential growth of length, fingering and   self-fractalization that are exhibited by the solutions.    %%%    The proposed research is essentially devoted  to the study of    evolution of interfaces: the surfaces that separate the solid and the    melted matter as it solidifies, or those that separate the fuel and    the burned products in combustion of gaseous or solid mixtures of    reactants. The latter is also known as high temperature syntheses and    can be employed for manufacturing of new materials. The shape and the    velocity of the interfaces as they propagate through the substance may    greatly effect the structure and the physical prope rties of the    resulting products. It was also demonstrated recently that evolution    of flame fronts may be applied to the nuclear flames in the    \"supernovae\" type stars.       ***",
