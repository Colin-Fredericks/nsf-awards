 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a project to examine the physical processes  that affect the manner in which heat, vapor and chemical species  in air are incorporated into snow and polar firn.  The processes  include advection, diffusion, and the effects of solar radiation  penetration into the snow.  An understanding of these processes  is important because they control the rate at which reactive and  non-reactive chemical species in the atmosphere become  incorporated into the snow, firn, and polar ice, and thus will  affect interpretation of polar ice core data.  Currently, the  interpretation of polar ice core data assumes that diffusion  controls the rate at which chemical species are incorporated into  firn.  This project will determine whether ventilation, or  advection of the species by air movement in the firn, and  radiation penetration processes have a significant effect.  Field  studies at the two West Antarctic ice sheet deep drilling sites  will be conducted to determine the spatial and temporal extent  for key parameters, and boundary conditions needed to model the  advection, conduction, and radiation transmission/absorption  processes.  An existing multidimensional numerical model is being  expanded to simulate the processes and to serve as the basis for  ongoing and future work in transport and distribution of reactive  chemical species.",
