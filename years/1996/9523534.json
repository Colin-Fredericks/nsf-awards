 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported jointly by the Analytical and   Surface Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division and the   Solid State Chemistry and Polymers Program of the Division of   Materials Research, explores the magnetic properties of   epitaxial monolayers and bilayers.  Spin resolved photoelectron   spectroscopy is used to probe the creation of magnetism in   non-magnetic metallic overlayers deposited on the Fe(001)   surface with elemental specificity.  X-ray photoelectron   diffraction is used to determine overlayer geometric structure   in these systems.  In combination with theoretical   calculations, this information is used to comprehensively   examine the creation of magnetic interfaces using normally   non-magnetic materials.  The novel properties of these   materials are of fundamental interest, and are relevant to the   understanding of magnetic thin film recording materials.  %%%  With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry   Program and the Solid State Chemistry and Polymers Program,   Professor Klebanoff of Lehigh University is investigating the   magnetic properties of monolayer and bilayer films of   non-magnetic metals deposited on magnetic iron substrates.    Magnetic information from spin dependent electron spectroscopy   coupled with geometrical information and theoretical   calculation, provide a detailed understanding of these   fundamentally important solid state systems.  A better   understanding of the magnetic properties of thin film materials   is essential for the continued health and growth of the   magnetic recording materials industry.",
