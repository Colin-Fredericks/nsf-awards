 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses automated speaker verification (ASV).  Speaker verification is the process of determining whether a given voice sample belongs to a particular person.  Analog complementary metal-oxide-silicon (CMOS) speech-recognition chips are presently under development, combining integrated silicon cochleae and neural networks based on auditory system modeling.  ASV will expand on this technology base.  ASV is a computationally intensive task but can be solved efficiently with massively parallel strategies  Phase I will develop an algorithm that uses a developed front-end cochlear processor in conjunction with a focused gamma neural network (FGNN) and a novel structure called a local receptive field gamma neural network.  Each gamma filter will be modified to behave as a speaker-matched filter.  Phase II would map an ASV algorithm onto dedicated silicon (analog or digital) to realize a reliable, compact, low-cost ASV processor.        ASV is useful for low-security access-control systems.  A low-cost, compact ASV technology will find applications in existing consumer electronics as a component of the human-machine interface.  In the home, answering machines, telephone long-distance access, and other low-security devices will be protected so that only particular speakers have access; specific cable-TV channels will be safeguarded by parental control; and speaker-trained toys will be programmed to know their `owner.`  Computers in sleep or screen-saver mode could be activated by an authorized voice.  Many other potential consumer applications are possible.",
