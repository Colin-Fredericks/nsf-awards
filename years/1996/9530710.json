 "awd_abstract_narration": "Weisberg  AST-9530710      Radioastronomical studies of the interstellar medium and pulsars  will be carried out. Observations will be conducted at the  Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, the Parkes radio telescope in  Australia, the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, and the  Very Large Array in New Mexico. In particular, the upgraded  Arecibo Observatory telescope and the Green Bank Telescope will  be highly sensitive instruments that will enable one to make much  more sensitive observations than previously possible.    The interstellar medium studies are divided into three main  categories: In the first, neutral hydrogen line absorption  spectra of distant pulsars will be obtained and measured and  kinematic distances will be determined from these spectra. The  electron densities along the pulsar-Earth lines of sight will  then be derived from distances and dispersion measures, and  models of the Galactic distribution of electrons will be compared  with these results. In the second category, the spatial structure  and physical properties of interstellar hydrogen will be studied  with neutral hydrogen line absorption measurements of high-  latitude and nearby pulsars and recombination line observations  in the directions of pulsars. The third category consists of  studies of the Galactic magnetic field through Faraday rotation  measurements of polarized pulsar signals. Temporal and small-  scale spatial variations will be studied in one experiment, while  the broad structure of the magnetic field will be investigated in  another.    There are also three main categories of intrinsic pulsar  investigations: First, full Stokes parameter pulsar polarization  profiles will be measured and calibrated, and morphological  classifications will be assigned on the basis of these and all  other published observations. Second, polarized profiles will be  examined for temporal variations that could indicate free  precession or intrinsic beam changes as well as the Galactic  magnetic field variations di scussed above. Third, the emission  beam geometry will be studied via empirical/geometrical analyses  and fits of the rotating vector model to measured position  angles.    Undergraduate students at Carleton College will be involved in  the research program.",
