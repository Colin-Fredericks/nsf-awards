 "awd_abstract_narration": "9629775  Lynch    There is genetic variation for almost every character in almost every species.  A leading species.  Al leading explanation for this variation is that there is a high mutation rate to mildly deleterious variations, and these variants are slowly lost by natural selection.  The study organism is the microcrustacean Daphnia arenata; its short generation time, variation in reproductive mode, and ease of handling in the laboratory and the field make it easy to study these questions.  These processes are general across all organisms, so using a species that is easy to study allows general insights into how mutation affects genetic variation. This project will estimate the mutation rate for several  life-history and morphological traits.  The mean and variance of the mutations' homozygous and dominance effects, and their interactions with other genes will also be estimated; these values are necessary to understand how selection acts on these mutations.  These lab-derived estimates will be compared with field populations to see how mutation affects genetic variation, inbreeding depression, and genetic correlations among traits.    This project is important for estimating how much genetic variation in populations contributes to the potential for response to changed conditions, such as new diseases or climate change, and how much is simply deleterious and lowers the survival and fertility of individuals.  Estimates of the rate and effects of deleterious mutations contribute to assessing the vulnerability to extinction in small populations of endangered species.",
