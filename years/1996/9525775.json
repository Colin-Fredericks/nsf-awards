 "awd_abstract_narration": "9525775  Hedges   The biodiversity of the West Indies is the most fragile in the New World because of rapid deforestation, very low levels of forest cover, and a high human population density. In many areas, natural forests essentially have disappeared except for small patches of secondary forest in which numerous species, including some not yet named, still exist.  There is an urgent need to document the existing biological diversity on these islands befoer it disappears.  The information gained will be valuable in efforts to identify hot spots of high species diversity and set priorities for those areas in greatest need of protection.   This project involves surveys and inventories of amphibians, reptiles, ans some invertebrate groups in poorely known and remote regions of the Greater Antilles.  Host country scientists and students are involved in the survey and inventory work, including collaborative taxonomic studies.  Tissue samples are collected and maintained for genetic studies of relationships, new species are described, and checklists, keys, and field guides are produced.  A comprehensive electornic database is being developed for the internet that contains information on many aspects of West Indain amphibians and reptiles.",
