 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lewis  9630611      Reproductive behavior is mediated by a hormone called  gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) which is produced by cells in  the brain.  This hormone is secreted by neurons and binds to a  specific protein, called a receptor, on GnRH target cells.   However,  little is known about how the binding of this hormone to  its receptor influences other nerve cells and subsequently controls  reproductive behavior.  Dr. Lewis is investigating the mechanisms  by which GnRH binding to its receptor changes the excitability of  neurons.  She is using a unique and powerful system to express the  GnRH receptor in nerve cells that do not normally contain the  receptor.  Her studies center on the coupling of the receptor to  intracellular second messenger systems, which lead to changes in  permeability to various electrically charged molecules.  These  investigations will generate valuable insights into the coupling of  intracellular messengers with receptor activation, and provide an  improved understanding of the basic principles underlying  reproduction in all species.",
