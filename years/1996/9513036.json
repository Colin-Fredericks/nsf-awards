 "awd_abstract_narration": "9513036  Matyjaszewski    This award supports the participation of 9 U.S. researchers  in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Macromolecular Architecture and  Engineering, to be held in Sendai, Japan from October 27 to  October 31, 1996. The co-organizers are Prof. Krzysztof  Matyjaszewski of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh  and Professor Prof. Shohei Inoue of Science University of  Tokyo.  The theme of the proposed seminar was chosen in  order to highlight recent advances in the elaboration of  novel polymerization methods and their use in the design of  new and well-defined complex macromolecular architectures  capable of generating advanced materials with controlled  optical, electronic, ionic, biomedical, high strength, and  other special properties.  Important contributions in each  of these areas are being made both in U.S. and in Japan, and  increased exchange of ideas and information between these  two groups is clearly warranted.   The U.S. participants  provide a broad cross section of expertise and geographical  representation in the area of synthetic polymer chemistry  and polymer characterization, and were selected on the basis  of being the most active researchers in the U.S. Therefore,  this proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its  exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an  international collaboration.  ***",
