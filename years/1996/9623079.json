 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Chanillo  9623079    The project consists of ten problems, all proposed in the field of   Partial Differential Equations(PDE). Eight of the proposed problems pertain   to questions arising in non-linear PDE, and two problems are proposed  to study over-determined systems of linear partial differential   equations. The non-linear problems all arise from various situations   that arise in Physics and Geometry. There is a stronger focus in the   proposal on systems of PDE than on single equations. The problems  are selected in part because solutions to them and understanding them   require some understanding of classical Harmonic analysis.     Very often the behaviour of a physical system is described by partial   differential equations. Thus it is important to know how to solve   these equations. Very often there are many, many solution families   and thus one may really not know all the possible solutions.  However if by some technique we can cut down the list  of solutions and show that only solutions of a certain category are the   the only possibility then the task of determining all solutions become   easier. For example if an equation exhibits symmetry one could try to   show that all solutions of the equation will have this symmetry manifest.  This will automatically rule out large classes of objects and focus our study   on a small class which will then tell us everything about the equation.   Recently there has been a great surge of interest in solutions of a  type of equation called the Ginzburg-Landau equation (GL equations),   named after  the Russian physicists, Ginzburg and Landau who first   used them in theories of superconductivity in the 1950's.   The GL equations also appear in string theories. A major part of   our project is devoted to classiying all the solutions of the   Ginzburg-Landau equation.",
