It has been observed over the years that frontal boundaries  sometimes appear to propagate in a discrete rather than continuous manner.  While  observed with some frequency, this behavior has not been well documented nor  studied in any depth.  The principal investigator proposes to begin an exploratory  study of discretely-propagating fronts.  The objectives are: 1) establish the  characteristics of discretely-propagating fronts and their environment, 2) determine  why and how fronts propagate in a step-like (discrete) manner, 3) relate the  processes of discrete propagation to current theories concerning frontogenesis, and 4)  construct a conceptual model of discrete propagation.        The research methodology is composed of four parts: 1) compilation of a ten  year climatology of discrete propagation events using standard surface and upper air  data, 2) compilation of the properties of individual events and construction of a  composite environment, 3) numerical simulation of a representative event(s), and 4)  calculation of the evolution of each of the terms (processes) that contribute to  frontogenesis over the entire model domain and for the complete life cycle of the  event(s).  Under this initial research effort primary emphasis will be on objectives 1  and 2.  While some progress is expected on the remaining objectives, they will be  attacked more fully under a subsequent  research effort that will be proposed only if  warranted after completion of this exploratory effort.        It is expected that the knowledge gained from these investigations will  enhance our understanding of how frontogenesis is related to potential vorticity  anomalies and, most importantly, why, and under what conditions, discrete  propagation occurs. It is anticipate that the results will provide practica l benefits,  such as improvements in short-term (3-18 h) weather forecasts. The results should  also provide a basis for further theoretical studies of the frontogenesis problem.  ***",
