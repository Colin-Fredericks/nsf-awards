 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this work is to develop methodology based on new  instrumentation which can be used for detection and structural analysis  of ultralow levels of molecules of biological importance, i.e peptides  and  protein digests. In particular, this will involve the interface of  capillary separation methods to an ion trap storage/reflectron  time-of-flight mass spectrometer detector using a continuous flow MALDI  method.  In this  method the chromatographic or separation products  will be delivered via a flow probe directly into the ion trap where  MALDI is performed from a continuously flowing Liquid directly from the  tip of a probe in a manner analogous to continuous flow FAB  experiments. The ions generated will be analyzed using an ion trap  storage/reflectron time-of-flight device which can provide enhanced  sensitivity and solution in the liquid MALDI process via the long teem  storage and cooling effects of the ion trap in combination with a  reflectron time-of-flight device. In addition, the advantages of trap  operation at high pressure when interfaced to d~ liquid flow from  capillary columns will be demonstrated.  The IT/reTOF will be shown to  provide structural analysis via the MS/MS capabilities of  the trap.  The basic methodology will be applied to enzymatic digests which  generally yield fragments that are less than 3000 Da. In addition, the  capabilities of the method will also evaluated for chemical digests  which may yield products up to 8-10 kDa in some cases. This method will  be directly compared to on-line capillary analysis using an  electrospray source interfaced to the  IT/reTOF also being developed in  our lab. The specific advantages of the CF MALDI for digest analysis in  terms of identification, sensitivity and for its ability to perform in  the presence of interfering salts and buffers will be evaluated.",
