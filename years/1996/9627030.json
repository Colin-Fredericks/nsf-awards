 "awd_abstract_narration": "9627030  Krakauer    The North Carolina Museum of Life and Science will develop two  areas in a new 70 acre outdoor exhibit \"BioQuest Woods: Linking  Animals and Plans with Interactive Exhibits\".  This concept is to  pair live animals and plants in their natural setting with science  center-style interactive exhibits to communicate key ideas in  biology and physics.  Support will go to sixteen interactive  stations in two four-acre theme areas \"Catch the Wind\" and \"Down to  Earth\".  \"Catch the Wind\" will assist visitors in the exploration  air movement and learning about how plants and animals use air in  specialized ways.  For example, visitors will experiment with air  thermals while observing the behavior of birds of prey and will  learn how prairie dogs exploit the venturi effect to ventilate  their burrows.  In the \"Down to Earth\" thematic area, visitors,  simulate the activities of field biologists, will track bears  equipped with radio collars, examine living invertebrates, among  other activities.  Scientific instruments, including microscopes,  in kiosks will aid on-the-scene study of live animals and plans.   \"BioQuest Woods\" will help visitors, teachers and students gain the  realistic experience of scientific inquiry in a natural setting.   Education programming will highlight curriculum linkages and  fulfills the goals of North Carolina's new science curriculum.  It  directly addresses the State's competency-based goals requiring  understanding of natural systems and the interrelations of the  basic sciences.  Pre and post-visit materials will be developed  along with teacher guides and enhancement activities.  This project  is being developed with the cooperation of the Austin Nature  Center, the National Zoo, and the Indianapolis Zoo.",
