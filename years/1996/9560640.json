 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates the design of a steam modulated water jet that can be used for surface cleaning or material machining operations.  The collapse of a steam bubble in subcooled water is known to result in pressure waves of very large magnitude.  These pressure waves can be used to fracture and/or remove material from a surface if directed.       A water nozzle which periodically injects steam bubbles into subcooled water will be studied.  The pressure from the collapsing steam bubbles is directed through an acoustically designed nozzle to the work surface.  It is anticipated that the device, when perfected, could be used to remove any affixed material safely and efficiently without degrading the properties of the substrate surface (wood, steel, concrete, or composite) or otherwise fatiguing or damaging the surface.  All of the removed material is carried away in a filtered water stream and produces minimum waste and no dust.       The successful development of a steam modulated water jet cleaner would result in a new cleaning tool which has no moving parts and the potential for achieving material removal rates heretofore not attainable, with minimum waste, no dust, substantially lower cost, enhanced operator safety, and surface integrity maintained.",
