 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curves offer many important  computational advantages over the \"ordinary\" Bezier/B-spline  representations commonly used in CAD/CAM applications. Among the  attributes that distinguish PH curves from the latter are: exact  rectification in terms of a polynomial arc-length function; exact  rational representations of their offsets; a closed-form  expression, suitable for purposes of optimization, for their  elastic bending energies; and a propensity to yield fairer loci  --- exhibiting a smoother curver distribution --- in the  interpolation of discrete data. Moreover, existing CAD systems  can readily take advantage of these properties, since the PH  curves are entirely compatible with the Bezier/B-spline  representation.    This project investigates outstanding theoretical and algorithmic  issues concerning the construction and manipulation of PH curves.  Their solution will permit the full potential of PH curves to be  realized in applications such as rapid prototyping and NC  milling. These issues encompass trimming procedures for PH curve  offsets; real-time CNC interpolators for PH curves; optimal shape  design with PH curves; algorithms for efficient construction of  C2 PH splines; and alternate algebraic formulations for PH space  curves.  ***",
