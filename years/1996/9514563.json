Data gathered with reference to child-  caregiver attachment, child temperament, features of the social   support network, life events/daily hassles, and attributes of the   peer setting itself are used to test a formal model of supports   for children's social competence in a sample broadly   representative of working and middle class families across a   range of ethnic groups in the State of Alabama. Latent variables   in the formal model are derived from multiple, independent   variables assessed concretely. The model posits both direct and   indirect pathways of influence from family relationships to peer   social competence. Data gathered will afford opportunities to   explore emerging structural and supportive properties of young   children's social networks from both mother and child   perspectives and explorations of the mothers' networks as   influences on children's networks. Also examined will be   influences of parent-child attachment and child temperament on   children's social competence with peers. Finally, the data will   provide opportunities to evaluate effects of life events stress   and daily hassles on attributes of the social network and on   social competence. Because samples will be drawn across a broad   range of socio-demographic parameters, it will also be possible   to test influences on social competence from levels of social   organization such as \"classroom,\" \"neighborhood,\" and   socioeconomic status position.  %%%  This 3-year project investigates individual, relational, and   socio-ecological factors supporting children's social competence   among peers in a sample of 3-4-year-old children in center-based   child care settings. A sample of families will be recruited in   each project year that covers the spectrum of ethnicity an d   income levels targeted in the study, in approximate proportion to   the population of the State of Alabama. Approximately 25% of the   sample in each project year will come from African-American   background and approximately 50% of the sample in each project   year will have family incomes below the median income level in   Alabama. Information gathered in the course of the project will   test a formal model that hypothesizes direct and indirect   influences of family relationships and child temperament on peer   social competence and on attributes of children's social   networks. Peer competence is assessed in the context of child   care classrooms. Home visits are used to observe parent-child   interactions relevant to the quality of their relationships.   Social networks and life events stresses are evaluated from   interviews with both the parent and child. The data collection   plan and analytic strategies afford opportunities to assess the   influences of the classroom, the neighborhood, and various   socioeconomic indicators on both the social support networks and   peer social competence. Results from this study may be used to   inform policy concerning optimal timing of group care experiences   for preschool children, and will also be relevant to evaluating   the relative influences of families, classroom social and   physical environments, and informal social support networks on   children's sense of well-being.  ***",
