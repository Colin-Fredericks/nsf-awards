 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program provides continued support to Dr. Robert R. Holmes of the   Chemistry Dearptment, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, for   research on the reactivity of phosphorus and silicon compounds.  During   substitution reactions, phosphorus and silicon accommodate five or six   groups around the central atom.   Highly reactive species of this type   will be synthesized, characterized using NMR spectroscopy, and modeled   using ab initio methods and the capabilities of  the San Diego   supercomputer Center.  Cyclic pentaoxyphosphoranes and isoelectronic   five-coordinate anionic silicates will be the focus of the investigation.    Substituents with rings of varying sizes and a variety of donor atoms   will be prepared.  The phosphorus work is expected to give information on   the mechanism of hydrolysis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cAMP,   while the silicon work models the initial stages of silanol   polymerization.  In both cases, the goal is to explore the formation of   six-coordinate intermediates as the source of the increased reactivity   observed for five-coordinate phosphorus and silicon compounds.  The   reaction rates for hydrolysis and solvolysis of the higher coordinate   derivatives will be determined and compared to those of the lower   coordinate species.  Nitrogen donor atoms will be used in order to mimic   the functions of amino acid residues present at the enzymatic active site   and assess their role in forming higher coordinate intermediates.  This research will determine the role of an alternate reaction pathway in   two important cases.  The possibility of six-coordinate intermediates   affecting both reactivity and geometry in the physiologically important   reaction of phosphoryl transfer or in the commercially important   polymerization of silanol has not been previously explored.",
