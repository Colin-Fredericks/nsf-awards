 "awd_abstract_narration": "The analysis of motion is crucial in understanding the biomechanical basis  of fundamental physiological processes. Funds are requested to purchase a  high-speed imaging system that will allow the quantitative analysis of the  musculoskeletal system in both vertebrates and invertebrates. The criteria  for selection of a high-speed imaging system is followed by the direct  comparison of the top three systems currently available. The imaging system  chosen is the NAC HSV-SOOHSG. This video system can operate in low light  conditions, has dual camera capabilities, can film at rates up to 500  frames per second in standard VHS format for 43 minutes, and has direct  analog overlay. All these features are required for the proposed research.  Questions to be addressed include: (1) Are phylogenetic constraints  controlling the evolution of a novel feeding system in fish? (2) What is  the effect of temperature on skeletal muscle performance? (3) What role  does chemoreception play in the modulation of a stereotypical behavior in  lobsters? (4) Can biomechanical models be used to test the direction of  evolution in functional novelties? (5) Can kinematic analysis of wing  movement in flies be used to generate models of character evolution?          All behaviors that are the subject of this research occur at very  high frequency and are beyond the scope of study using conventional film or  video. Furthermore, these projects require the analysis of complex  movements in three dimensions, thus, the NAC HSV-500 best meets our needs.  A university contribution of 50% matching funds towards the purchase of the  video equipment has been provided.",
