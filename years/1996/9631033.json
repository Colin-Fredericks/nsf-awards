This is an interdisciplinary conference with strong connections  to the communities of physics, chemistry, materials science, and  materials engineering. The conference format involves primarily  invited speakers with approximately one-half of each session  devoted to an in-depth discussion.  In addition, a poster session  will be held that will enable other attendees to present their  work.  %%%  The proposed conference will provide a dynamic forum for the  presentation and discussion of new work on laser interactions  with materials and applications to a number of new technologies.
