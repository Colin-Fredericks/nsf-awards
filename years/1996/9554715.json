 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this workshop is to disseminate material that will  assist in Computer Science course and curriculum changes. The  approach is the direct result of previous NSF CCD funding (CS-NSF-  5239-92) which focused on the use of C++ and closed laboratories to  effect a better teaching/learning environment. The keystone of this  new curriculum is a 4-course core sequence which incorporates  closed laboratories.  Lecture materials and content are supportive  of the laboratories rather that the reverse as is usually done.  This work was completed in the summer of 1995.  The proposed  workshop with be 5 days, with participants selected from a range of  programs across the nation. Participants will be expected to  familiar with C++, and interested in developing new curriculum and  laboratory material and methods for the early years of Computer  Science education. C++ will be the utility language for this work.  Participants are supplied with a complete set of software and  printed material to carry back to the home institution.  This will  include lecture slides, laboratory manuals, and teacher's manuals.   More important will be the opportunity for each participant to  experience the pedagogical and technical driving forces for the  material, and how they are used. Participants will be able to  apply/use this material when they return to their CS programs.",
