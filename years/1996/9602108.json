 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professors Paul Ellis and Joseph Kapusta  , plus a postdoctoral associate and two graduate students  from the University of Minnesota, to collaborate in  theoretical physics research with a group of scientists from  the Universities of Bergen and Oslo in Norway and the  University of Copenhagen in Denmark, under the coordination  of Eivind Osnes of the University of Oslo.  The Nordic  scientists are part of a large Northern European  Collaborative `Project on Relativistic Heavy Ion  Collisions.`  The general objective of that regional project  is a better understanding of high-energy heavy-ion  collisions, with particular emphasis on the properties of  excited nuclear matter. It is providing theoretical support  for experimental work by others dealing with energetic  collisions of complex atomic nuclei.  The specific  involvement of the US researchers is studying the dynamical  mechanisms of hadronization of the quark gluon plasma.  Ultimately this will lead to a detailed description of  hadronization, allowing conclusions to be drawn regarding  the observable signals of hadronization.  Broadly speaking, this research involves the theoretical  study of nuclear collision at the highest energies available  to experiment, which are expected within a few years to  produce a Quark-Gluon Plasma.  There is little basis yet for  predicting reaction dynamics in the presence of a phase  transition, and this research is attempting to provide  theoretical insight into the evolution of the Quark-Gluon  Plasma.  It will also seek to define possible signals of  hadronization and chiral symmetry breaking and restoration,  and evaluate the sensitivity of the signals to underlying  assumptions about the equation of state and correlation  functions.  Results of the proposed studies will increase  knowledge of the structure of extended, stronglyinteracting  matter at very small scale, which is relevant to  understanding of the early universe, among other phenomena.  The results will also be very useful in planning and  evaluating future heavy ion experiments in large  accelerators.",
