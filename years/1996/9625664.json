 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Patrick Hoggard, Department of Chemistry, Santa Clara University, is   supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of   the Chemistry Division to perform studies of radical chain reactions in   solution which are initiated through the absorption of light by the   solvent.  Specifically, he will determine whether the initial oxidizing   agent in chloroform solvent-initiated reactions is a peroxy radical or a   hydroperoxide. Reactions in which the metal-based quantum yield increases   with decreasing irradiation wavelength will be explored using osmium,   molybdenum and palladium di- and tri-nuclear species in chlorinated   solvents. Ruthenium bipyridine reactions will be probed under conditions   where oxygen is not limiting in an attempt to discover photoreversible,   temperature-hypersensitive systems. Examples of potential  applications   of these phenomena include systems that periodically change composition   under irradiation, `smart` glasses that darken under irradiation above a   given temperature, and photocatalytic systems for the destruction of   halogenated hydrocarbons in water.  The absorption of light energy is commonly used to initiate chemical   reactions. When these reactions take place in chlorinated solvents, there   is some ambiguity as to whether the reactants themselves absorb the   energy, or whether the solvent molecules absorb the energy first and then   transfer it to the reactants.  This is an important mechanistic question   because of the potential applications which can result from a clear   understanding of these processes and the corresponding ability to   manipulate them.  Dr. Hoggard will examine a series of metal complex   substrates with differing reduction potentials and search for new   solvent-initiated photoreactions.  He will also pursue photocatalysis   studies of chlorohydrocarbon degradation in aqueous media as well as   reactions which are hypersensitive to temperature.  These types of   photoreactions can have high quantum yields, and may have implications   for the degradation of environmentally recalcitrant chlorinated   hydrocarbons.",
