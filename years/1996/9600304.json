Dr. Earle will work with Dr. Yoshio  Fukao, director of the Earthquake Research Institute, on a  research project entitled, \"The Teleseismic Survey of the  Upper-Mantle Reflectivity Structure Beneath the Mid-Atlantic  Region.\"    The proposed research will determine the sharpness (depth  extent) and topography (depth variations) of seismic  discontinuities occurring at average depths of 410- and 660-  km.  At present, seismic stations located in Japan form part  of a unique geometry for studying the discontinuity  structure below the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  Energy originating  from earth-quakes in the Tonga and New Hebridies trenches  reflects from discontinuities beneath the Mid-Atlantic Ridge  before arriving in Japan.  This energy is recorded on two  Japanese seismic arrays: the J-array (over 300 short-period  seismometers blanketing Japan) and POSEIDON (a network of  more than 30 modern broadband seismometers located in and  surrounding the Japanese islands).  The research will use  seismograms from earthquakes of magnitude > 5.6 occurring  after April 1991 (birth of the J-array) to examine seismic  wave arrivals which have interacted with seismic  discontinuities.  Drs. Fukao and Earle will develop  automated methods to analyze over 70,000 seismograms  contained in this data base.  Array processing techniques  will aid in the positive identification of these small  amplitude reflections and will be used to place constraints  on the Earth's chemical composition, temperature variations,  and the nature of material flow within it.  ***",
