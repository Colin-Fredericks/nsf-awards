It has limited taxonomic affinities to other deep sea  communities, and yet it has affinities to the faunas of deep-sea  hydrocarbon seeps and other seep environments. This deep-sea vent  environment may have been a refuge protecting vent taxa from the  extinction events which had great impacts on other communities.  Thus, deep-sea hydrothermal vents are one of the major ecosystem  types on the earth, but probably the least known. The existence  of these communities depends upon the ability of a few  invertebrate/ bacteria symbioses to oxidize reduced chemical  species (sulfide or methane) from the vents using oxidants  (oxygen or nitrate) from the surrounding deep-sea water to power  primary production. Thus the capacities for interaction of the  symbioses with the chemical properties of vent environments is  fundamental to the primary production which supports these  ecosystems. The central objective of this project is to describe  and quantify the chemical interactions of the tubeworm Riftia  pachyptila with the vent fluids which flow over it so that these  interactions can be modeled for entire assemblages of animals.  This project includes development of indices of growth rate,  primary production, condition, and environmental conditions based  on measurements made on freshly collected worms. The project has  3 components: 1) Survey of diverse vent and seep environments to  determine the responses of chemoautotrophic symbioses to widely  differing conditions. The objective is to quantify a broad range  of parameters on samples from freshly captured worms and to  correlate these with environmental characteristics so that the in  situ interactions of the worms with the vent fluids can be  estimated. 2) Shipboard studies of the physiology supporting  autotrophy in symbiotic vent animals. The objective of these  studies is to measure the interactions of Riftia with the various  chemical parameters, a s well as the effects of temperature on  these interactions, to develop an understanding of the  functioning of the worms. Long term maintenance of worms in  pressure aquaria for growth studies is part of these projected  studies. 3) The observation and measurement of temporal changes  at 13 N. This includes deployment of temperature recorders to  measure the variation in conditions and selected observations of  the biota to describe the changes over time. The objective is to  describe the niche of the tubeworm on longer time scales so that  primary production and interactions with vent fluids can be  estimated over longer time periods. This project will greatly  increase our understanding of the nature of the interactions  between the vent animals and their chemical environments,  contributing to our understanding of the functioning of the vent  and other chemoautotrophically supported ecosystems.",
