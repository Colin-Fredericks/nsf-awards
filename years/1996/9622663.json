 "awd_abstract_narration": "Urbana-Champaign  This project, directed by Assistant Professor Jonathan V. Sweedler of the   University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, is focused on identifying and   quantitatively measuring neuronal releasates and assaying the contents of   individual peptide vesicles.  Support is provided by the Analytical and   Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry and by   Neuroendocrinology in the Division of Integrative Biology and   Neuroscience.  The work will develop new wavelength resolved fluorescence   detection methods for microseparations that allow neuropeptides and   classical neurotransmitters to be identified and quantitatively measured   without the need for chemical derivitization, provide methods to assay   the contents of individual peptidergic vesicles, and develop a separation   approach which allows the time course of peptide release to be followed.    These measurements are all concerned with the dynamics of cellular   communication and the studies are designed to lead to improved   understanding of the nervous system.  The bag cell neurons of the marine   mollusk, Aplysia Californica, will serve as a model system.  An understanding of the chemical pathways involved in the transmission of   a nerve impulse is essential to our gaining full knowledge of how the   nervous system functions.  This work will explore such pathways by   developing the measurement techniques needed to follow peptide   neurotransmitters which are typically present in very low concentrations   and which are found in the presence of many other biological compounds.",
