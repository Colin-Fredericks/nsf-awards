He will attempt to use methods of homogenization theory   in combination with the Bloch-Floquet expansion to understand various types   of resonances for wave propagation in composite materials consisting of an  array of piezoceramic rods embedded in a polymer matrix. He will study   two main classes of such problems. The first is where the acoustic   wavelength is comparable with dimensions of the composite microstructure   (long wave approximation). Here he will attempt to find the dependence of   the quality of electromechanical power conversion on the frequency and the   volume fraction of the piezoceramic phase and explain theoretically existing  numerical data for the thickness-mode resonance. This includes the   \"backing effect, i.e., the dependence of the resonance frequencies on the   stiffness of the backing medium. The second main class of problems that the   investigator will study  is the high-frequency regime when the acoustic   wavelength is comparable to the microstructure scale. The main effort here  is to extend homogenization ideas to the range of frequencies where the  composite material exhibits significant \"cross-talk\" between piezoceramic  rods. He will also study the transitional behavior between  these two  frequency regimes. The proposed work lies at the frontier   between mathematics and composites, and the investigator is planning to   support theoretical results by experimental and numerical data obtained at   the Penn State Materials Research Lab.  %%%   A composite material is a mixture of two or more single phase materials  (constituents) whose properties are far better than that of each constituent.  That is why composite materials are widely used in many areas of modern   technology and manufacturing.  In particular, piezocomposites are the   principal elements of modern acous tic transducers.  High-frequency   acoustic  transducers are used  for ultrasound medical imaging  and non-destructive testing of damaged materials. Low-   frequency transducers are used for underwater acoustics (so-called   hydrophones) as well as for  finding  fish, tracking vessels and   deep-sea seismology. Rapid advances in mathematical sciences within the   last 30 years open the possibility of understanding the general principles   and relationships linking the overall properties of such composite   materials to the properties of their constituents. This in turn makes it   possible to design more efficient, lower cost transducers.   However, progress has been hampered by expensive and time consuming   experiments and  by the enormous complexity of the phenomena. Huge   improvements in the ability to measure the properties of composite   materials have led to better characterization of their properties. However,   this precision of measurement has not been matched by corresponding   improvements in the mathematical theory, which could guide the   experimental study and industrial design of the transducers. This project   will involve devising and improving mathematical techniques and methods   for the study and design of piezoceramic composites for transducer applications.   The investigator will attempt to use modern mathematical techniques and tools   to understand various types of resonances for wave propagation in   polymer piezoceramic composites. This study will provide practical   recommendations for increasing the sensitivity and resolution   range of the transducers.   ***",
