 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of  ten talented  undergraduate students each year in the Training Undergraduates  in Science and Technology (TRUST) program at San Francisco State  University.  The goals of  TRUST are to: 1) prepare undergraduate  students with the skills and inspiration to enter careers in  science; 2) foster student development from relative dependence  to relative independence through emphasis on critical thinking  and student-driven discovery, and 3) prepare students for  applying, entering and attending graduate schools through  academic preparation, advising and identification of  opportunities for fellowships and grants.  The research theme of  TRUST is the importance and relevance of genetic diversity.  It  consists of a two week DNA technology workshop, evolved from  three years of prior NSF support, followed by eight week,  individual student-driven research internships.  Group activities  include critical thinking exercises, trips to Sierra Nevada and  Monterey Bay field sites, weekly informal round-table  discussions, graduate preparation workshops, and bioethics and  visiting scientists seminars.  Student faculty interactions will  be cultivated by a \"mentor-in-residence\" program in which  different mentors will live with the group of students each  weekend.  TRUST is expected to increase the participation of  women and under-represented groups in science because 60-70% of  our student recruitment pool is represented by these groups.  The  culminating experience for TRUST students will be seminar  presentations modeled after professional scientific meetings.  After a summer's participation, students will be tracked through  an E-mail network and annual contact by mail and phone.  In  addition, alumni of the program will participate as role models  in subsequent years.       This award will foster the continued education and training  of individuals who will be part of the next generation of basic  researchers in the various aspects of research i n environmental  sciences, including ecology, systematics and population genetics.  It will also help to inform young citizens about ethical  questions in science and aspects of management and decision  making in environmental issues.",
