 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to develop a new data-based model of the Earth's  magnetospheric magnetic field.      Modeling the geospace plasma environment is the essence of the GEM  project, and one of its special tasks is an accurate representation  of the distant geomagnetic configuration.  The model will be  specifically designed to meet the needs of the Geospace Circulation  Model providing the community with flexible tools to handle  magnetospheric current systems and quantitatively represent their  contributions to the total field.    The proposed study will be based on magnetometer data from many  spacecraft, accumulated over tens of years, and will use  sophisticated mathematical methods, allowing a flexible  representation of the observed fields.  The new model will provide  a realistic quantitative description of the geomagnetic field for  a wide range of distances, as a continuous analytical function of  the position, Earth's dipole tilt angle, solar wind  characteristics, the polar cap area, and appropriate geomagnetic  disturbance indices.    One of the principal goalq of this project will be to represent not  just the average magnetospheric configurations, but also its large-  scale time variations.  Specifically, it is intended to  quantitatively model such phenomena as        (i)   compression/expansion of the magnetopause in response to             solar wind gusts,       (ii)  gradual re-distribution of the magnetic flux during the             substorm growth phase, induced by the interplanetary                magnetic field, and       (iii) formation of the substorm electric current system             leading to the collapse of the previously stretched             configuration.    The main product of this effort will be computer codes for deriving  the time-varying model magnetic field.",
