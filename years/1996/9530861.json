 "awd_abstract_narration": "9530861  Buessler         This research project is part of the US Joint Global  Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) Southern Ocean Program aimed at  (1) a better understanding of the fluxes of carbon, both  organic and inorganic, in the Southern Ocean, (2)  identifying the physical, ecological and biogeochemical  factors and processes which regulate the magnitude and  variability of these fluxes, and (3) placing these fluxes  into the context of the contemporary global carbon cycle.       This work is one of forty-four projects that are  collaborating in the Southern Ocean Experiment, a three-  year effort south of the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone to  track the flow of carbon through its organic and inorganic  pathways from the air-ocean interface through the entire  water column into the bottom sediment.   The experiment  will make use of the RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer and the R/V  Thompson.       The objective of this component is to provide a  quantitative estimate of upper ocean export fluxes of  particulate organic carbon on spatial and temporal scales  relevant to understanding biological and physical  processes.  The approach is to measure the concentration of  thorium-234, a particle reactive tracer with a half-life of  24.1 days, and its ratio to particulate organic carbon  (POC) and particulate organic nitrogen (PON) in order to  derive the appropriate export data.       The research activities include the collection of  thorium-234 and POC samples on cruises spanning the  seasonal production cycle in the Antarctic Polar Front  Zone.  The results will be used to constrain the upper  ocean sinking fluxes and to derive relationships between  production and export across physical gradients (i.e.  fronts) during seasonal transitions between low and high  productivity.  The sensitivity of these rate estimates to  model assumptions and data quality will also be examined.  ***",
