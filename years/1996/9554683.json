 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year national program is a continuation of several  successful projects administered by Joliet Junior College(IL) and  Lee College (TX). It will provide 15 intensive workshops (five  each year) for two-year college physics teachers at several  qeoqraphically-dispersed two-year college campuses.    One set of workshops will acquaint participants with the  development and implementation of (1) microcomputer-based  laboratories in mechanics and heat; (2) digital video, modeling,  and microcomputer-based laboratories in electricity, magnetism,  and opticsi (3) physics simulationsi and (4) active learning  problem-solving strategies using conceptual exercises and overview  case studies. The fifth workshop will be a working conference on  introductory physics that will provide previous workshop  participants an opportunity for sharing, gaining additional  experiences, and discussing new developments and technologies.  Each workshop will be led by two, two-year college physics  professors and two or three university/college physics professors  who play a major role in developing these areas.    These workshops will provide participants with applications of the  recent developments and findings of physics education research. As  a result, participants will be able to evaluate these developments  and will return to their campuses to begin implementing the  workshop activities. Thus, these workshops, as they have done in  the past, will facilitate the rapid incorporation of this  knowledge and technology at two-year colleqes.    The impact of the workshops will be reinforced by the continuation  of a networking system that employs a microcomputer bulletin board  system, an Internet access system, and a newsletter. The ultimate  goal of this project is to help two-year college students develop  a stronger understanding of classical and contemporary physics.  The task of updating physics programs at two-year colleges is  difficult, but essential, for  the nation and for science because of the lar ge number of  students, particularly women and minorities, attending two-year  colleqes.",
