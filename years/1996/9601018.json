 "awd_abstract_narration": "9601018  Jelinski  The goal of this research is to understand the molecular  basis for the exceptional mechanical properties of dragline  silk from the spider Nephila clavipes.  This biopolymer  possesses a unique combination of high stiffness with a very  large extension to break, so that the toughness -- the  energy required to cause a tensile failure -- is very high.  This unique combination of properties makes this polyamide  in some ways superior to the best manmade synthetic polymers  such as nylon-6,6 and Kevlar. Solid state deuterium NMR and  high resolution solid state NMR, including REDOR, will be  the primary physical techniques used in this research. The  specific goals of this project are (1) to test the  hypothesis that the glycine-serine pairs are involved in  bends; (2) to understand the molecular dynamics and response  to stretching of the highly conserved tyrosine, leucine, and  tyrosine residues, which are known to reside in the  amorphous regions; (3) to discover the changes in amino acid  orientation and dynamics upon supercontraction; and (4) to  deduce how the spider processes the silk and then mimic or  modify this process in the laboratory.  This research will produve a fundamental understanding of  the structure, dynamics and processing of strong and tough  protein polymers, and thus it will provide the underpinnings  for the manufacture of an entirely new class of materials.  %%%  Now that the tools of modern biotechnology make it possible  to produce \"designer\" materials in bacteria and in plants,  it is appropriate and timely to develop a fundamental  understanding of certain biomaterials.   Silk from the  Golden Orb Weaving spider, Nephila clavipes, is being used  as a source ofb io-inspiration.  This silk is stronger per  cross-sectional area than steel, and stretches to 10% of its  length before breaking.  This research aims to identify the  molecular arrangements and motions that contribute to its  strength and toughness.  Such an understanding would permit  the  design of non-natural, protein-based, high-performance  materials.  Once the materials are produced it will also be  necessary to understand how to process them correctly so  that they acquire their ultimate mechanical properties.  The  spinning apparatus of the spider is being used as a source  of bio-inspiration to learn how to process these matherials  into fibers.  ***",
