 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  research  investigates  the  algorithmic  and  systems  issues  that  arise  in  on-line  and  off-line  distributed  manipulation  and organization tasks with cooperative  teams  of robots.  The objective is to develop a framework in which  it is easy to synthesize and reason about complex strategies  for  manipulating and organizing objects in  structured  and  unstructured environments, with teams of robots. Distributed  manipulation  systems  can be used for  tasks  that  require  reorganizing large objects in an environments,  for  example  waste   cleanup,   mine  sweeping,  and  furniture   moving.  Manipulation and organization can be formulated as placement  problems.   In  a  distributed  placement  problem  multiple  robots combine their skills cooperatively to move objects so  as  to  satisfy a desired global property of the environment  (for  example,  all  the movable objects  are  placed  in  a  designated  area.)  The research agenda is  to  develop  (1)  models for the information requirements of robot tasks;  (2)  algorithms  for  single robot manipulation  strategies  that  relay  on  given information requirements; (3) a  method  of  analyzing the structure and power of such algorithms; (4)  a  method  for  composing  reliable single  robot  manipulation  algorithms to obtain fault-tolerant cooperative manipulation  protocols  with  performance guarantees; (5)  a  method  for  establishing   trade-offs  between  sensing,  communication,  planning, and learning in distributed systems of robots; and  (6)  to implement, design, and test distributed manipulation  systems that use (1-5)",
