 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    This project concerns certain geometric properties of solutions of   partial differential equations. Of particular interest are a study of   the size of level sets, the maximal order of vanishing, and growth   properties of solutions of various types of partial differential   equations. The proposed method is a use of elliptic regularity theory   to find simplifications and extensions of the results of H. Donnelly,   C. Fefferman, and F.-H. Lin concerning geometric properties of   solutions of second order partial differential equations. The PI's   method, based on the theorem on elliptic iterates of Lions and   Magenes, leads to extensions to a wide class of linear and nonlinear   equations of elliptic and parabolic type with analytic  coefficients. The PI proposes to address some questions which still   remain unresolved, including, in particular, sharp bounds on the size   of level sets and the maximal order of vanishing for nonlinear   evolution equations and equations with non-analytic coefficients.    Nonlinear evolution equations, such as the Navier-Stokes system,   arise in in connection with numerous problems of mathematical   physics. Numerical and experimental models support the theory that   such equations produce chaotic behavior of solutions, i.e., solutions   which exhibit complex temporal and spatial oscillations. This project   addresses this issues and aims to obtain such intimate information of   solutions as their oscillatory behavior and their growth  properties. Information on these issues, which is the main purpose of   this project, would lead to better understanding of oscillatory  phenomena arising in many problems of fluid mechanics and related fields.",
