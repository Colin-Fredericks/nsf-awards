 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oakwood College, a private Historically Black College,  located in Huntsville, Alabama, is the recipient of funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program. The mission of the College is to provide access to education opportunity, academic excellence and spiritual development for its students who come from diverse backgrounds. Funds will be used to renovate and repair research and research training space in the Emerson A. Cooper Complex, a 15 year old structure that houses the Departments of Biology and Chemistry.  Specifically space in the -C+ Building of the Science Complex, originally designed as instructional laboratories will be renovated to correct problems that have resulted from age related deterioration and make space more conducive to performing research.  Renovations will consist of:  removal of walls to maximize space usage, upgrading of lighting, installation of additional electrical outlets, and fiber optic cabling, replacement of HVAC, and the installation of fixed equipment.  The renovations will allow the Departments of Biology and Chemistry to continue their active research programs that enhance science training.  Remodeling inadequate facilities will help utilize space more efficiently and provide space for faculty to accommodate additional undergraduate students in their laboratories and train more students for research careers. This project will be instrumental in the College's mission of sustained academic excellence, and the science departments' continuation of producing African American scholars that contribute to the scientific enterprise of the nation.",
