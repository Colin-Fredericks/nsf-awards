 "awd_abstract_narration": "9530762  Coale         This research project is part of the US Joint Global  Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) Southern Ocean Program aimed at  (1) a better understanding of the fluxes of carbon, both  organic and inorganic, in the Southern Ocean, (2)  identifying the physical, ecological and biogeochemical  factors and processes which regulate the magnitude and  variability of these fluxes, and (3) placing these fluxes  into the context of the contemporary global carbon cycle.       This work is one of forty-four projects that are  collaborating in the Southern Ocean Experiment, a three-  year effort south of the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone to  track the flow of carbon through its organic and inorganic  pathways from the air-ocean interface through the entire  water column into the bottom sediment.   The experiment  will make use of the RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer and the R/V  Thompson.       This component concerns the effect of iron on the  productivity of the upper layers of the ocean.  Dissolved iron concentrations in surface waters of the open  ocean are often extremely low, and have been shown to limit  primary production in high nitrate and low chlorophyll  regions of the global ocean.  As a result of an earlier  JGOFS study in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, models  describing the spatial and temporal variability in  production and export now include the role of iron as a  limiting micronutrient.  The observed patterns of  production in the equatorial Pacific were consistent with  the supply and distribution of iron in this region.  However, there are very little data on iron concentrations  and distribution of iron in the Southern Ocean that could  be used for such interpretations.  For example, we do not  know if iron concentrations are enhanced or depleted in  Southern Ocean upwelled waters.  Also, very little  information is known concerning the concentrations,  distributions, or sources of iron in the Southern Ocean and  as a result, it is currently difficult to correlate  patterns of productio n in these waters with the  distribution of iron.       Systematic measurements of trace metal distributions  in the Ross Sea and in the Antarctic Polar Front Zone with  an emphasis on iron will be made as part of this study, and  will provide a data base that will allow the evaluation of  Southern Ocean biological processes in terms of a possible  iron limitation. The results of this work will be a  significant contribution to our understanding of iron  biogeochemistry in the Southern Ocean, and to our  understanding of factors which control rates of new  production in these regions.  They will have a direct  bearing on our understanding of the global carbon cycle.  ***",
