Interconnect materials systems to be studied include conductors, adhesion promoting layers and barrier layers. The research concentrates on metal conductor materials (silver and its alloys), but a substantial aspect of this investigation is the integrated systems approach to multilevel metallization that seeks greater understanding for addressing long term future solutions (lower resistivity Ag alloys) and more near term solutions (Cu alloys).  %%%  This research project will extend the investigator's preliminary advances in Cu metallization materials science and processing to integrate critical aspects of basic research advances with two Educational Innovations, Outreach to K-12, and a collaborative Community College activity with the Maricopa Community College District which includes courses televised to local industry.  In addition to the educational outreach activities, an important feature of the program is the general integration of research and education through the training of graduate students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. The proposed basic investigations of metallization and contact formation are expected to contribute fundamental materials science knowledge of technological relevance to advanced microelectronic devices and circuits.  The knowledge and understanding gained from this research project is expected to contribute in a general way to improving the performance of advanced devices and circuits used in computing, information processing, and telecommunications by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved materials with greater reliability and performance.  ***",
