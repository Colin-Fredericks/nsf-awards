 "awd_abstract_narration": "The survey of human genetic diversity and similarity is an important issue which addresses the  very basic question of human evolution and history.  In this study, the researchers will study the  extent of genetic diversity among the populations of insular Southeast Asia for the following  principal reason. This region of the globe has witnessed several major developments in the  evolution and dispersal of humans.  However, questions such as whether the Austronesians are  the most likely founders of Polynesian Islands need to be addressed in greater detail. Also, the  question arises whether there is any genetic link between the island Southeast Asians and the  New Guinea populations in spite of their linguistic differences. Although recent studies using  mitochondrial DNA variation have addressed some of these issues, our knowledge will remain  incomplete in the absence of information using nuclear DNA polymorphisms, as these  researchers will do.   Two significant strengths of this proposal are: (1) they already possess a large repository of DNA  samples collected from the representative populations of the area, which can be analyzed  immediately to achieve the specific aims of this study; (2) via existing and prospective  collaborations with other investigators, who are studying mitochondrial DNA variation in the  same populations and at the same nuclear DNA loci in the populations of Oceania and Australia,  this study will bring about a combined effort which will yield important insights into population  structure and evolutionary history of the greater Pacific region.",
