 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This award is to support a collaborative project between Dr. Nadir Dagli, Department of Electrical and Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) and Dr. Atilla Aydinli, Department of Physics, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey.  The purpose of this research is to develop guided-wave polarization sensitive couplers and polarization converters in GaAs/AlGaAs material system, and eventually to use these components in the realization of polarization independent ultra fast traveling wave electrooptic modulators.  Current work at UCSB has produced traveling wave electrooptic modulators with electric bandwidth in excess of 40 GHz.  These modulators have relatively high switching voltages, excessive loss in coupling with optical fiber, and work only for TE polarization.  The planned work will seek the production of devices with low switching voltage and low fiber coupling losses.  The work proposed includes transfer of software developed at UCSB to the Bilkent team to use it in producing the modulator devices.  These devices, and others produced at UCSB, will be subjected to optical tests such as loss measurements, and DC electrooptic tests such as the DC modulation response.  Scope:  This award allows for collaboration by two laboratories with complementary capabilities who are currently carrying out similar research independently.  The award will allow visits by Dr. Dagli to Bilkent U. to provide the software and the required initial training and to help the Turkish scientist and a graduate student start the fabrication process.  In the second year Dagli will again visit Bilkent U. to work on the testing process and to transfer the technology developed and the experience gained to his laboratory at UCSB.  This award is funded jointly by INT and the Division of Electrical and Communication Systems.",
