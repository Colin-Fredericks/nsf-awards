 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests partial funding for a Microscopic  Imaging Laboratory to be used by members of the Departments  Molecular Cancer Biology of the Duke University Medical  Center and Department of Botany of Duke University. The  users already have a Zeiss AxioSkop microscope outfitted for  fluorescence microscopy, which was purchased with funds from  Duke University. This application proposes to purchase a  Hamamatsu cooled charged coupled device (CCD) camera with a  thermal printer and monitor that would provide the  capability of high resolution and high sensitivity imaging.  Accessories that would greatly enhance the flourescent  capabilities of the instrument and the camera are also  proposed. Moreover, a Z-axis stepper is proposed in order to  be able to obtain 3D reconstructions.       Two areas of great interest are represented by the work  proposed here: first, the understanding of key regulatory  events in the cell cycle of eukaryotes and second, the  unraveling of the architecture of the eukaryotic nucleus.  The work on the cell cycle is carried on by Drs. Lew,  Garrett, Horowitz, Kombluth and Swenson. The relationship  between regulatory events in the cell cycle and cellular  morphology is studied by Dr. Lew using the baker's yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Dr. Swenson is elucidating  signalling pathways controlling entry into meiosis in surf  clam and amphibian oocytes. Dr. Horowitz's laboratory  focuses on the regulation of the cell cycle in mammalian  cells. The regulation of DNA synthesis as an integral  decision of cycling cells is investigated in Xenopous laevis  eggs by Dr. Kornbluth.       Work on nuclear architecture is ongoing in the  laboratories of Drs. Garcia Blanco, Kohorn and Kornbluth.  The project in Dr. Garcia Blanco's laboratory focuses on the  relationship between nuclear architecture and the  machineries that processes pre-rRNA and pre-mRNAs. Dr.  Kohorn, in collaboration with Dr. Garcia Blanco, is  investigating the nuclear architecture in Chlamydomonas.  Th is organisms provides the possibility of doing biochemical  and genetic analysis of nuclear functions and is much better  than Saccharomyces cerevisiae for studies that visualize  nuclear structure.       These projects require precise image acquisition and  storage systems. The continuation of the work requires a  high sensitivity and high resolution camera to elucidate new  cellular structures.",
