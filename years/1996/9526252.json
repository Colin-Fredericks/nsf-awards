 "awd_abstract_narration": "Feldmann  OPP 9526252    Abstract  This award supports a study of fossil crabs and lobsters from the  southern hemisphere with the goal of understanding the  paleobiogephraphic framework of these fossils compared to  molluscs and foraminifera.  Field work and laboratory analysis of  fossil crabs and lobsters from Antarctica and other high latitude  sites in the southern hemisphere has now provided a robust data  base from which the pattern of paleobiogeographic distribution  can be discerned.  Recent field work, supported by the National  Science Foundation, has resulted in the collection of several new  faunas which more narrowly constrain the northern influence of  Antarctic fossil biotas than has been possible previously.  Laboratory analysis of these faunas coupled with examination of  significant museum fossil collections made by other workers in  Madagascar and on Alexander Island, Antarctica, will assure that  the principal investigator will have examined and confirmed the  identification of all known decapods from the mid and high  southern latitudes.  As a result, knowledge of these organisms  will be great enough to synthesize their geologic history and  evolution which, in turn, will make it possible to test the  paleobiogeographic framework of these animals against models  based upon the more commonly preserved molluscs and  microorganisms.",
