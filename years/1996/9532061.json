 "awd_abstract_narration": "CMS-9532061    The failure of systems composed of brittle materials such as  concrete and  rock is controlled by the development and accumulation of  microdefects  referred to as damage.  Macroscopically, damage reduces the  elastic  stiffness, causes anisotropy, and reduces the load-carrying  capacity of the  material.  The objective of this research is to identify  damage through the  acoustic emission (AE) technique and to use this measurement  of damage to  assess the onset of failure in systems composed of rock-like  materials.    The accumulation of damage has a fundamental importance for  defining the  behavior of brittle materials in terms of their strength.  In addition, the  importance of detecting brittle failure of structures is  brought on by the  use of high-strength concrete, by the urgency in preserving  classical  monuments, and by the need to evaluate aggregate durability.  It is claimed  that a quantitative analysis of damage can be applied to  components of  full-scale structures by simplifying the deconvolution  process for  determining source mechanisms and orientations.  The impact  of this  research on the infrastructure will be the real-time  monitoring of systems  to evaluate damage in the form of cracks, voids, loss of  bond, and other  detrimental processes leading to failure.    ***",
