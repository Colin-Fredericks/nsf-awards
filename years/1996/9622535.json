 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research in the general area of spectral  theory and number theory, with particular interest in trace  formulae, explicit formulae and prime number theorems, spectral  theory on degenerating Riemannian manifolds, and various analytic  and arithmetic aspects of Arakelov theory on Calabi-Yau  varieties. Jorgenson is continuing his collaboration with Serge  Lang. They are studying the heat kernel on symmetric spaces to  provide further examples of their general theory. Specific  examples such as Hilbert modular and Picard modular varieties  will be studied deeply. Jorgenson is continuing resarch with  Andrey Todorov in the study of the spectral theory and arithmetic  of Calabi-Yau varieties. The long term goal of this study is the  development of a theory of arithmetic of Calabi-Yau varieties  which would be similar to the existing theory of arithmetic of  elliptic curves. With Jozek Dodziuk, Jorgenson is studying the  spectral theory of degenerating families of finite volume  Riemannian manifolds which possess metrics that have constant  negative sectional curvatures near the developing singularities.  Jorgenson is continuing ongoing research with Jonathon Huntley in  the study of Weyl's laws for the counting function of cuspidal  eigenvalues on quotients of symmetric spaces of arbitrary rank,  with particular emphasis on the symmetric spaces associated to  GL(n,R). In collaboration with Jurg Kramer, Jorgenson is  continuing the investigation of the Arakelov theory of Calabi-Yau  varieties.  This research falls into the general mathematical  field of Number  Theory. Number theory has its historical roots  in the study of the  whole numbers, addressing such questions as  those dealing with the  divisibility of one whole number by  another. It is among the oldest  branches of mathematics and was  pursued for many centuries for purely  aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century it has become an  indispensable tool in diverse applications in areas such as data   tran smission and processing, and communication systems.",
