 "awd_abstract_narration": ":    The International Conference on Forensic Statistics, scheduled  for the University of Edinburgh June 30-July 3, 1996, is the  third in a series of tri-annual conferences intended to provide a  forum for the interaction of researchers in the areas of law,  forensic science, social sciences, and statistics.  Among the  goals of this conference are (a) the fostering of interaction  among research specialists in different disciplines, (b) advances  in topics of current interest to the courts, and (c) the  development of a firm scientific basis for the use of statistical  evidence in the courts.    Presentations scheduled include reports on the ethics of expert  testimony, DNA fingerprinting and its forensic uses, inferring  causality, statistical evidence of environmental harm, the use of  econometric models in anti-trust litigation, and the judicial  reception of meta-analysis for combining statistical information  across scientific studies, especially those involving   the harmful effects of exposure to drugs and environmental  hazards.    This travel grant supports the participation in the Conference by  several leading American statisticians, forensic scientists, and  social scientists as well as several promising young scientists  who are currently beginning to pursue research in this  interdisciplinary field and have sought the opportunity to  present their work in an international context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Over the past four decades statistics and statistical methods  have played increasingly important roles in the evaluation of  forensic evidence and in the presentation  of scientific evidence  more broadly in the courts.  American scientist have played a  prominent role in this development and have led initiatives  intended to improve the quality of statistics as  evidence as well  as to improve the interaction between statisticians and other  scientists as they prepare materials for use in a legal context.   While expert testimony in the American legal system has unique  features, important aspects of the science associated with the  expert testimony transcend national boundaries. The Third  International Conference on Forensic Statistics, to be held on  June 3 to July 3 1996, is a unique forum for the interaction of  researchers in the areas of law, forensic science, social  sciences, and statistics and this travel grant   supports the participation of several leading American  researchers from these different fields of interest.  Among the  topics of current federal strategic interest featured in the  conference presentations are biotechnology and its role in the  manufacture of drugs as well as the evaluation of forensic   evidence, and the assessment of harmful effects as a result of  environmental exposure.",
