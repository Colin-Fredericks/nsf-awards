 "awd_abstract_narration": "9523794  Suuberg    The objective of this project is to conduct fundamental research  on a pyrolysis process that can be used to convert scrap tires  into activated carbon.  The research involves establishment of  optimum temperature, pressure and gaseous environmental  conditions that are necessary to produce carbon that has porosity  characteristics that permit its use in adsorption processes such  as devices to remove pollutants from water and air.  Chars  produced will be evaluated for their adsorption behavior relative  to significant classes of adsorbates potentially present in  water, wastewater and in gaseous products of combustion such as  organic substances, nitrogen oxides and mercury.    The results of the experimental work will be used in formulation  of models that can be used in engineering design of processes for  converting waste carbonaceous materials into \"activated carbon,\"  a useful form of carbon for removing pollutants from water,  wastewater and gaseous products of combustion.  The investigator  plans to collaborate with personnel of Advanced Fuel Research,  Inc., a firm that conducted research under NSF Grant No. 92-15045  on the feasibility of using discarded vehicle tires for producing  marketable forms of carbon.",
