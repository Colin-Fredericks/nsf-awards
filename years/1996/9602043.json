 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports collaboration by Dr. Joseph  Liu, Professor of Engineering at Brown University, and an Egyptian scientist: Dr. Reda Mankabadi, Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Cairo University.  The research deals with the various facets of heat transfer under longitudinal vorticity systems.  This includes the effect of various manifestations of vorticity systems when faced with different leading edge structures or fine-grained turbulence in the boundary layer.  The effect of fluid injection as well as compressibility due to large temperature load effects will also be studied.  Applications are directed at flow and heat transfer configurations in independent experimental efforts elsewhere.  The methods used will include analyses and numerical computations including spectra and finite-difference schemes.  The proposed research should provide a better understanding of heat transfer enhancement, resulting from the appearance of streamwise vortices, that is essential in the heat (and material) transfer control and augmentation.  It should provide improvement in design of new devices in applications such as heat transfer problems in turbomachinery and heat exchangers.  Scope:   This project brings together two scientists with long experiences and capabilities in research in the field of turbomachinery analysis.  The collaborative project seeks improvements in the design and manufacture of heat exchangers, particularly those used in power stations, and thus contribute to the loss reduction and energy savings in both countries.   The work will involve participation of graduate students and dissemination of research background and results to undergraduate students.  The project meets the objectives of the Division of International Programs.",
