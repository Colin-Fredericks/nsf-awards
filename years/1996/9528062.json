University of Minnesota  Title: IDEAL Studies on the Paleolimnology and Paleoclimate of Lake  Victoria: fossil invertebrate assemblages as proxies for climatic  and anthropogenic change    The IDEAL initiative is a multinational effort to study the  limnology, modern and past ecology, and paleoclimatology of the  large lakes of East Africa.  Undisturbed recovery of an in situ  sediment profile is a prerequisite for successful paleolimnological  study. This award supports the development of deep-water freeze-  coring technology to meet the sampling challenges presented by  tropical lakes, in particular deep productive lakes where fine  stratigraphy can become disrupted in unfrozen core samples by post-  recovery degassing of sedimentary methane.  The device will be used  to collect cores of recent sediments in profundal and sublittoral  areas of Lake Victoria, visited during the IDEAL 1996 field  campaign.  Fitted with a well-constrained 210Pb-chronology, these  undisturbed sedimentary archives will permit reconstruction of Lake  Victoria's 19th- and 20th century history at the finest temporal  resolution possible.  Study of the freeze-core samples will focus  on natural and anthropogenic changes in species composition of  benthic and planktonic invertebrate communities, for which  currently no long-term data are available.  Analysis of fossil  invertebrates in long piston-core records from Lake Victoria  collected by IDEAL will produce valuable independent information on  the lake's late Quaternary history and help constrain paleoclimatic  interpretations based on sedimentology and stable-isotope  geochemistry.",
