 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shared  training  and  research facilities  at  the  Albert  Einstein  College  of Medicine have been developed  substantially  during the past decade. The focus of these facilities has been in  structural and mechanistic biology. These new facilities  include  a)  an  x-ray  crystallography suite with  facilities  for  three  faculty  members  and  trainees, b) a mass spectrometry  facility  with  three  instruments, faculty and staff, c)  a  facility  for  micro-scale   peptide   synthesis,  isolation,   sequencing   and  analysis,  d)  a laser spectroscopy laboratory for  time-resolved  molecular  spectroscopy which supports a broad group  of  faculty  and  trainees, e) a synchrotron beam-line at Brookhaven  National  Laboratories  which  currently  supports  research  and  training  activities of faculty members in several departments.  These  new  facilities  have added to the strengths of existing  programs  in  pulsed  EPR  spectroscopy (Dr. Jack Peisach), and biological  NMR  (Dr.  Raj  Gupta).  Together, these facilities  make  the  Albert  Einstein  College of Medicine one of the premier  training  sites  for structural biology in the greater New York area. Each year, a  larger  fraction of the approximately 300 Ph.D. and  postdoctoral  trainees are involved in structural biology training as  part  of  their research programs.          A  weakness in our training and research programs has  been  the  deficiency in multipleresonance high-field NMR equipment  of  the  type  required  for structural determination  of  biological  molecules  by current technologies. This deficiency was mentioned  in the written critiques for each of the past two site-visits for  training  grants  in  structural biology and biophysics  at  this  school.          This  proposal describes a plan to remedy this weakness  by  the  construction  of  a structural NMR resource  containing  two  spectrometers and associated workstations for molecular modeling:         600 MHz 1H13C15N triple resonance 2.5 and  5 mm probes, 4    channel system, 3-axis gradients       300 MHz 1H13C31P19F 5 mm probe and 10 mm broadband    multinuclear probe, 2 channels       four 175 MHz UNIX graphics workstations located in the  facility for offline data analysis    The facility will be newly constructed for the purpose of housing  this equipment and will be located on the ground floor of the  Ullman Research Building, excavated into foundation bedrock. A  highly qualified faculty member, Dr. Mark Girvin, has been  recruited to oversee the facility. A full-time staff person will  also be provided. The structural NMR resource will operate as a  shared research and training facility available to all faculty  and their trainees.    Examples of research problems under investigation by faculty and  their trainees include:         structure of the transmembrane subunit c of F1Fo ATP    synthase from E. coli       melting rates of stem-loop RNA secondary structure and the    influence of RNA binding proteins       structure/function relationships for cell-surface N-linked  complex carbohydrates       structure of domains which constitute protein-localization  binding sites       structure of chromogranin A1-40, a disulfide secretory  protein and the effect of AA-replacements       structure of the linker region of the membrane protein  P-glycoprotein       determination of catalytic site flap movements by NMR of  15N-labeled tyrosine phosphatase       analysis of the binding of carbohydrates to lectins by NOE  and paramagnetic effects          In addition to fostering these research programs, the  structural NMR resource will be used as the site for a hands-on  advanced level graduate school course in the theory and practice  of solving structural problems by NMR. The course is to be taught  every two years so all Ph.D. students will have the opportunity  to learn NMR methods of structural analysis. The location of the  graphics workstations in the structural NMR resource will  facilitate use of the laboratory for graduate an d postgraduate  training.",
