Potential application areas include automotive and aircraft  related mechanical systems, electric power plants, and pulp  and paper mills, and discrete production processes such as  manufacture of ceramics and semiconductors, where structural  durability of plant components and operational reliability  are critical. Based on the understanding of physical  phenomena and the data available, analytical deterministic  models of damage dynamics are formulated for selected  materials in a continuous time-setting as opposed to the  commonly used cycle-based models of fatigue damage.  Stochastic modeling of fatigue dynamics is advanced based on  an ensemble of experimentally generated statistical data. An  on-line damage monitoring system is built using the  stochastic model with series inputs from basic sensing  elements. Experimental validation of the concept is  accomplished via a test apparatus fabricated in the  laboratory with equipment and test samples provided by NASA  Lewis and Sikorsky Aircraft Company respectively.***",
