 "awd_abstract_narration": "Schlinger  9602139      It is widely recognized that the gonadal steroid hormones have  profound effects on the developing brain and on the function of the  adult central nervous system.  Interestingly, in both males and  females of many species, estrogens exert some of the most dramatic  effects.  However, it is not always clear how estrogens reach  estrogen-sensitive brain regions nor is it clear how estrogens act  to influence neuronal growth or function.  In the brain of some  species, there is a remarkable neural circuit that controls the  organism's ability to learn during development and to translate the  learned information into behavior as an adult.  Estrogens are  implicated in the initial growth of this circuitry during early  development, in the neural mechanisms underlying learning, and in  the activation of adult behavior.  All estrogens are derived from  androgens, a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme aromatase.  In males,  circulating androgens are converted to estrogens locally in the  brain.  It is these estrogens that act to masculinize the  developing brain and then activate masculine adult brain function.   In some species, aromatase is present in the neural circuitry  underlying learning, which may be associated with the effects of  estrogen on learning.  Dr. Schlinger is continuing his  investigations into the role of aromatase and estrogen on  estrogen-dependent learning and behavior, and will conduct  cross-species experiments to characterize the effects of estrogen  more clearly.  By clarifying properties of steroid synthesis and  function in brain, we will gain a better understanding of how  activities of the neural and endocrine systems are coordinated in  regulating neural function.  In addition, these investigations  provide a mechanism to further foster species survival in natural  environments and gain a better understanding of events crucial to  reproduction in the wild.",
