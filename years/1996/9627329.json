This workshop will bring together thirty-four of the best experts  in the field to accomplish the following goals and objectives:    1. Discuss the recent major advances in the field.    2. Determine where the US stands in various R&D areas, including  applications, hardware, materials, components, devices, and  algorithms.    3. Determine both the short term and the long term major research  and development goals in the field.  Discuss what needs to be done  in the next five years, and what should be done in the next ten to  fifteen years.    4. Discuss strategies to accomplish the short and long-term goals,  including:         o Encouraging cross-disciplinary and joint research among       algorithmic, systems integration, and materials and devices       research efforts to facilitate the deployment of optical       techniques in security, verification, and anticounterfeiting.         o Identifying industrial/commercial applications of optics and       optoelectronics security, verification, and anticounterfeiting       and discussing how more industrial/commercial funds can be       obtained for R&D.         o Determining how optics can complement the existing       electronics security, verification, and anticounterfeiting       techniques and processors.  ***",
