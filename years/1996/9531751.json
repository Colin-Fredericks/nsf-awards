 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program supports research by Dr. Jack R. Norton of the Chemistry   Department, Colorado State University, on the reactivity of   organometallic transition metal complexes, with emphasis on the behavior   of hydride ligands in enantioselective reactions.  The first project is   to develop an NMR method to detect hydride ligands in the presence of   acid in order to test the thermodynamic driving force for proton tranfer   isotope effects, and to develop optically active hydride complexes that   can transfer hydride to opposite prochiral faces of a substate at   substantially different rates.  Proton addition to oxygen- and   nitrogen-containing ligands will be followed.  In a related project,   enantioselective synthesis of amino acids promoted by zirconocenes will   be investigated with particular attention on increasing the yield and   selectivity of the reaction.  Protic cleavage of Zr-C bonds catalyzed by   CO will be studied as will the use of  zirconium nitrene complexes to   prepare enantiomerically enriched amino alcohols.  This project has two main themes:  reactions of metal hydrides and   zirconium chemistry.   The metal hydride studies are designed to develop   new ways to transfer hydrogen from a metal hydride to an organic compound   while maintaining a desired stereospecific orientation.  The zirconium   compounds are potentially useful agents for reactions in which C-C and   C-N bonds are formed.  The results will be relevant to understanding the   fundamental behavior of hydrogen reactions with metal compounds and to   developing new reagents for organic synthesis.",
