 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622854  Papanicolaou    The research is in the following areas: Pulse reflection from Random Media   and Radiative Transport, the Focusing Singularity of the Nonlinear   Schrodinger Equation, Convection Enhanced Diffusion, and Direct and Inverse   Problems for High Contrast Media. In Pulse reflection from random media the   goal is to extend the previous work for acoustic waves to elastic waves.   It is proposed to get deeper into the study of transport approximations for   waves and the derivation of effective boundary conditions for the transport   equations.In the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation the goal is to address the   very hard problem of whether or not time dispersion prevents the formation   of finite time singularities. In convection enhanced diffusion the plans are   to continue the past study convection dominated phenomena by considering time   dependent and nonlinear flows and using the saddle point variational   principles that proved so useful in the previous work by the PI. In the area   of High Contrast Media it is proposed to to focus primarily on inverse   problems where linearized inversion schemes are not suitable when the   parameters to be estimated have large variations over the spatial domain.  %%%    This research is aimed at understanding the behavior of complex  materials and environments using advanced mathematical modeling  and solution techniques. Applications include seismic imaging  in exploration seismology and in a more global environment,  tomographic imaging of geophysical environments, turbulent  dispersion of contaminants and related problems. This research  is closely related to the applications, and addresses specific  issues that arise there, while staying at the cutting edge of  what mathematical analysis can do at present and producing  new and interesting mathematics.",
