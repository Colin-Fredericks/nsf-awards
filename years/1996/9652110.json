 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many of the problems identified in undergraduate science education--fragmentation of knowledge, overspecialization, inadequate emphasis on student learning--parallel those in other disciplines. Some, such as the inability to communicate well, result from deficiencies in what is traditionally called `general education.` Yet the very separation of gen-ed from specialization in the major creates fragmented learning. Nowhere is this problem more intractable than in large universities like Northeastern University (NU), where independent colleges offer a wide array of programs to students with differing expectations.    NU proposes a new model for undergraduate education that, by fully integrating gen-ed and the major and placing responsibility for the former with the faculty charged with the latter, holds transformational promise for all of undergraduate education.    Through a consultative process, the NU community has identified the shared general education goals that will undergird the new model. Applicable to all our programs, they include a set of skills, contexts, perspectives, and connections, translatable by departmental faculty into field-specific objectives. Students will achieve the goals in a cumulative manner by following pathways designed by the major department faculty using disciplinary and liberal arts courses, modules, and non-classroom experiences (e.g. cooperative education).   Within the project's goal and broad objectives, the principal specific objectives for the two grant years include:  1. Launching implementation of the new model in the Colleges of Engineering and Computer Science, the School of Engineering Technology, and the science departments within the College of Arts & Sciences.  2. Advancing implementation of the science-related shared goals (information literacy, quantitative reasoning, and an understanding of the natural world) in the non-science units.  Evaluation and assessment, both of student learning and of programmatic success have been built into the project from the outset.    Northeastern requests $200,000 over a two-year period from the NSF to support predominantly faculty development (in competency-based education, teaching gen-ed skills in disciplinary contexts, assessment, and the use of interactive pedagogies) and released time/stipends for curricular modification in the science and technology areas of the project. The model should be of particular interest to other complex universities and NU intends to continue sharing widely its experiences.",
