 "awd_abstract_narration": "Moment resisting R/C frames if properly designed and  detailed they are very ductile systems capable of enduring  the most severe earthquake input motions. There has been a  substantial number of investigations of R/C beam to column  connections, but at least one common connection problem has  not been adequately researched, namely, connections in frame  systems composed of wide shallow beams and `normal` columns.  Over the last decade they have also been used to a limited  extent in regions of moderate to high seismic risk. Due to  the lack of experimental studies for these frame systems,  conflicting design recommendations have been developed.  Because wide beam connections are not uncommon in concrete  frame construction, and because there is a lack of  information on the behavior and resulting seismic response  of concrete frames that contain such connections, there is a  clear need for a well planned analytical and experimental  investigation of reinforced concrete frames that contain  such connections. The goal of this research project is to  combine prior experimental results with a limited number of  new test results to generate analytical models for  simulating the seismic response of wide beam frame  structures. Then, combine the analytical and experimental  studies to develop detailing requirements as well as  recommendations for the proper use of wide beam frames,  i.e., in what seismic zones, for what number of stories and  in combination with what other lateral load resisting  systems. This study will draw conclusive understanding to  the seismic behavior of reinforce concrete frame with wide  beam connections through laboratory experiments and finite  element analysis and the results could form the basis for  updating seismic design provisions for such connections.",
