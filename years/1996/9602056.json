One process, mitosis, requires interactions among many serial and parallel biochemical pathways that are coordinated by the cell cycle. Intracellular free Ca2+  (Ca2+i) regulates specific biochemical and physiological aspects of mitosis, for example, nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB). Prior to NEB there are highly localized pulses of  Ca2+i within discrete domains which are called quantum emission domains (QEDs). These QEDs were detected using aequorin luminescence to report Ca2+i and a multispectral video microscopy combined with a high performance computational image and signal analysis system. The analysis of various QED-patterns suggest that Ca2+i prior to NEB are evoked by an intracellular chemical signal that is generated proximal to the QEDs, contradicting models that evoke diffusible agonists or of Ca2+-activated Ca2+ release. The spatial and temporal resolution of this multispectral approach far exceeds that obtained by other methods; This approach also avoids perturbations that are associated with many fluorescent Ca2+ reporters that cause problem with Ca2+-buffering or cause UV toxicity. The observed Ca2+i-QEDs patterns are highly structural, non-random, and are apparently of a digital frequency modulated format. These patterns could explain how Ca2+i control many cellular processes, a particular frequency controls a particular event.  These early studies will be extended in order to correlate spatial and temporal patterns of the Ca2+i-QEDs within microdomains with events in mitosis that are known to be Ca2+-dependent. These studies will be conducted in sand dollar (Echinaracnius parma) blastomeres. Computational analyses using sophisticated pattern analysis algorithms and high performance computing should result in identifying and in classifying a type of cellular semantics and syntax. A library of Ca2+i-QED patterns will be collected from normal mitotic c ells and from cells whose Ca2+ regulation mechanisms has been altered. This collection of patterns should allow a deciphering of the language of Ca2+i signaling.  Leukotriene B4 (LtB4) evokes Ca2+i-QEDs in sand dollar eggs and in mitotic cells. Inhibitors that interfere with the production of LtB4 inhibit mitosis in a time and dose dependent manners. The cell cycle pattern of LtB4 metabolism as well as the expression of enzymes of the arachidonic acid pathway will be determined in an attempt to correlate these events with Ca2+-dependent mitotic events. Analogous studies will be conducted with a class of luminescent 02- sensitive fungal compounds to monitor 02- production during lipid metabolism.  The general goal of these studies is too learn how cells make decisions that are a function of Ca2+i. The identification of Ca2+i-QEDs as a type of cellular language with lipid metabolites controlling the expression of this language should bring us closer to understanding how certain decisions are made as well as where and when these decisions are made.  %%%  The role of Ca2+ in controlling various cellular processes presents an enigma in its ubiquity and selectivity. One process, mitosis, requires interactions among many serial and parallel biochemical pathways that are coordinated by the cell cycle. Intracellular free Ca2+ regulates specific biochemical and physiological aspects of mitosis, for example, nuclear envelope breakdown. As yet little is known about how the cell make decisions involving intracellular free Ca2+.  ***",
