 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a new, multidisciplinary research  training program focused on aspects of Biogeochemistry  important to increased understanding of environmental  change.  A group of 25 faculty drawn from eight  organizational units of  Cornell, the Boyce Thmopson  Institute and the Institute for Ecosystem studies will  collaborate to develop one of the first U.S. graduate  programs in Biogeochemistry.  Training will include a set of  4 required  courses,  some newly developed for the RTG,  research rotations in faculty laboratories and field  research sites, technical workshops and seminars that will  bring leading researchers from other institutions.  Besides  providing students with fundamental knowledge of  both  biogeochemistry and ecosystem analysis, the program will  emphasize training in the use of state-of-the-art techniques  in biogeochemistry and environmental microbiology.  Areas of  research to be emphasized include studies of accelerated  nitrogen movement through landscapes into rivers and  estuaries, studies of effects of humans on nutrient and  water levels in forest ecosystems, and studies of wetland  microbiota active in generation of methane.  The goal of the  program is to produce highly interactive, creative and  multidisciplinary-based students who will be able to  contribute to understanding global change and other  environmental problems.  ***",
