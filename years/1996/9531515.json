 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Kenneth Showalter is supported by a grant from the Theoretical   and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his work on nonlinear   dynamics in chemical systems.  The research involves studies of complex   chemical dynamics in continuously stirred reactors, in homogeneous and   unstirred systems, and distributed chemical systems.  Three main lines of   research are proposed: 1) developing techniques to control chaos using   linear and nonlinear control methods; 2) studies of chemical waves in   inhomogeneous and perturbed excitable media; and 3) studies of   instabilities in propagating reaction-diffusion fronts.  Both   experimental and theoretical studies will be performed.  One novel   experimental project being explored by Showalter is the use of an ink jet   printer to prepare patterns of immobilized catalyst for excitable   chemical systems.  This enables him to study chemical wave behavior in   the presence of systematically designed geometric constraints which are   models for excitable biological media such as the heart muscle.  Nonlinear dynamics is a powerful tool for understanding complexity in   nature, and it has many practical applications.  Biological applications   include stabilizing periodic rhythms in heart tissue and inducing   periodic and chaotic behavior in hippocampal brain tissue.  Major   successes can also be found in applications of the principles of   excitable media to cardiology, which have led to an understanding of the   role spiral waves play in heart maladies such as tachycardia and   fibrillation.  Showalter's research provides a fundamental chemical   understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings for these important   biological phenomena.",
