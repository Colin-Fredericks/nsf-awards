The project, which consists of a 4,000 to 6,000 square foot traveling exhibit and related educational materials, will focus on the science and technology underlying movies and television, including motion, light and optics, sound, electricity and magnetism, chemistry, and geometry/trigonometry.  The exhibit also will examine the impact of advances in the technology of movies and television and the resulting impact on audiences and society.      The PI will be Rochelle Slovin, founding director of the AMMI.  Carl Goodman, Curator of Digital Media, and Richard Koszarski, Head of Collections and Exhibitions, will serve as exhibit content specialists.  The integration of science principles and activities into the exhibit will be under the direction of Ted Ansbacher, a physicist who previously served as Director of Exhibits at the New York Hall of Science.  Thom Thacker, Director of Education at the AMMI, will be responsible for the development of educational outreach material.",
