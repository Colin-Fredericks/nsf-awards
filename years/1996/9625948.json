 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computation of transition rates between different protein conformations has important applications in protein engineering and structure-based drug design.  However, conventional molecular dynamics and transition state theory methods are unable to cope with the extremely high dimensionality of most practically important problems, even large-scale parallel computing.  To significantly improve the efficiency of these computations, the PIs are developing a new class of methods that utilizes hierarchical coarse-grained analysis of protein potential energy landscapes.  In preliminary tests of low-dimensional (1-12) model systems they have shown that this method can improve computational efficiency by two orders-of magnitude. They will extend this approach first to the computational study of conformational transitions of peptides, and subsequently to proteins.  Multiple-level parallelization will be an important component of the algorithmic developments required for these extensions.  Training will be collaboratively guided by two members of the Cornell Theory Center who together can provide instruction both in parallel computing and compuational biophysics.",
