 "awd_abstract_narration": "9530378  Kiene    This three year study will increase our fundamental understanding  of the role played by dissolved DMSP in the biogeochemistry of  reduced sulfur in surface seawater. The specific objectives of the  project are 1) to test whether the dissolved DMSP pool measured by  conventional filtration techniques is truly dissolved; 2) to  measure the kinetics of uptake for dissolved DMSP by natural  microbial assemblages using 14C and 35S DMSP and to determine  in situ turnover rates for DMSP (d); 3) to measure the sulfur  products formed during DMSP degradation and to determine how the  branching ratio between the lyase (DMS forming) and demethylation  (methanethiol forming) pathways vary in different waters; 4) to  determine mechanisms of methanethiol production in aerobic seawater  and finally, to determine the loss kinetics of MeSH in seawater and  the factors which affect these. The work will be carried out using  primarily coastal and shelf water samples from the Northern Gulf of  Mexico, but 2 oceanographic cruises are planned to provide  complementary information from warm oligotrophic and cool  mesotrophic ocean waters. The resulting data should greatly advance  our knowledge of how DMSP is processed in the sea and how it  impacts the chemistry of surface waters through production of  important reduced sulfur compounds like DMS and methanethiol.",
