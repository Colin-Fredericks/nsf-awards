 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623261  Antman    The PI proposes to treat a variety of dynamical and  steady-state  nonlinear problems for rods, shells, and three-dimensional solid bodies.  The bodies are composed of nonlinearly elastic, viscoelastic, plastic,   viscoplastic, or magnetoelastic materials.  He also intends to treat    fluid-solid interactions. In each case, properly invariant, geometrically   exact theories encompassing general nonlinear constitutive equations are to   be used.  The goals of these studies are to discover new nonlinear effects,   determine thresholds in constitutive equations separating qualitatively   different responses, examine important kinds of instabilities, contribute to   the theory of shocks and dissipative mechanisms in solids, and develop  new methods of nonlinear analysis and of effective computation for problems   of solid mechanics.    %%%    The investigator proposes to study the behavior of various solids  undergoing large dynamic deformations, including cases in which the  solid  is interacting with a fluid, as happens in airplanes and ships.    By applying  modern mathematical methods to theories of deformable solids   formulated with great generality and precision, he intends to treat problems   for large families of materials at one time.  One aim  of this work is to  determine unexpected instabilities, which can adversely alter the response  of structures used in technological applications.  He also  proposes to contribute to the theory of material behavior,  to the  development of methods for the control of material behavior (by using smart   materials involving electromagnetic effects, for example), and  to the   development of new mathematical and computational methods capable of handling   these difficult and important applications.    ***",
