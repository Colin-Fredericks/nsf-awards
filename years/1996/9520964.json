 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520964  Schutt-Aine  The electrical performance of high-speed integrated circuit and digital networks strongly depends on the electromagnetic performance of interconnects between components of a system.  In recent years, packaging  has become a critical area in the design of high-speed communications systems and fast computers.  The purpose of this research is to provide the technology necessary to design aggressive packaging schemes in the areas of design, modeling, testing, measurement and circuit simulation.  This objective will be achieved using electromagnetic theory as an analysis tool to yield a better understanding of interconnect problems.  The implementation of computer-aided design tools for this simulation of packages and interconnects will be achieved.  New design ideas will be studied and evaluated and solutions will be proposed for current system level integration  problems.  The complete effort is aimed at facilitating the task of circuit designers and reducing cost and time associated with the testing and evaluation of a given interconnect scheme.  ***",
