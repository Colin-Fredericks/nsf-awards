 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625604  Szelenyi    This doctoral dissertation improvement project investigates gender relations in a high-tech U.S. multinational corporation in New Delhi, India.   Some researchers argue that through the process of transferring operations overseas there is a convergence of work structures (i.e., corporations exports their labor policies along with their capital and techncology) while others argue that there is a divergence process (i.e., organizations are embedded in the social environments in which they are situated).  Multinational corporations hire millions of female workers throughout the world and these workers have become an integral issue in the construction of work relations in the global economy.   This research will examine the issue of gender relations in the global workplace by first outlining the patterns of gender division of labor that exist in the cultural ideologies of the U.S. and India.  Second, it examines the following specific questions:  What happens during the confrontation of gender regimes when an American corporation sets up operations in India?,  Which country's gender regime prevails and how is it formalized in the workplace?  and  What processes contribute to its formalization?    In-depth interviews, observation and document analysis will be conducted to assess the cultural character of the gender division of labor in this multinational corporation as evidenced by gender segregation of jobs, social interaction, physical and temporal mobility and ideologies governing cross-gender interaction of male and female workers.  ***",
