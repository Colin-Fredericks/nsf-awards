 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mixtures distributions have been used extensively as models in  situations where data are viewed as arising from a population  that is comprised of several subpopulations mixed in varying  proportions.  In this context, model identification can be  thought of as obtaining estimates for the unknown parameters  which in the most general situation will include the number of  components, $k$, the mixing proportions and the parameters from  the component distributions.    The purpose of the proposed grant is to enable the Principal  Investigator to extend her previous work on minimum distance  estimation for mixture models and to become more familiar with  the existing research on model selection in the context of  mixture models.    The research will focus on two areas. First, it will extend the  work of the PI on minimum Hellinger distance estimation  for univariate mixture models to the multivariate case. This will  involve investigating and deriving an appropriate multivariate  density estimator for mixture models as well as considering the  computational aspects of it.  The advantage of this method is  that it produces estimates that are both efficient and robust to  the presence of data contamination unlike maximum likelihood  methods.    Second, the PI will consider the case when the number of  components is unknown.  In this case one can obtain estimates for  the other parameters for a reasonable range of $k$'s and then  choose from among those models using a model selection criterion.  Investigation of the use of existing criteria in this situation  as well as application of a new criterion using Bayesian  Restoration Minimization method for computing posterior  distributions will be considered.",
