 "awd_abstract_narration": "9531487  Morrow   This REU site award will bring eight undergraduates to the University of   Washington to work on inverse problems. The inverse problem for an electrical network is   to determine the conductivity of each of the resistors in the network when the response of   the network to boundary voltages is known. The inverse problem in impedance   tomography is to determine the conductivity throughout the interior of a conducting body   from measurements of potentials and currents on the boundary. Students will investigate   relations between the response matrix of an electrical network and the conductors in the   network. They will also work on applications of these discrete problems to inverse   problems for conducting bodies.    The program will run for eight weeks. During the first week there will be lectures   describing known results, open problems, and numerical approaches. Students will then   begin working on projects of their own choosing, using the available computing facilities,   if appropriate. Students can work on their own or in teams of  two or three. They will   continue to meet at regularly scheduled times for the remaining weeks. At the end the   students will write papers on their projects.",
