 "awd_abstract_narration": "9531276  Fleming  Risk sensitive stochastic control is concerned with the optimization of expected  exponential cost criteria.  It provides a link between stochastic and deterministic  (robust  control) approaches.  Risk sensitive control is related to large deviations theory for  stochastic  processes.  Dynamic two player games also arise naturally in the analysis.   For continuous time models described by controlled stochastic differential equations,  these games (called differential games) are analyzed using viscosity  solution methods  for nonlinear partial differential  equations.  One part of this research concerns risk   sensitive control, with complete state information (state  feedback).  Extensions of  existing theory, and applications to engineering control and financial economics will be  considered.  A second part of this project concerns partial state information (output  feedback) risk sensitive control, where the theory  is less well developed.  A key idea  in the analysis is that  of information state.     The disturbance attenuation problem in control theory is to design feedback control  laws which give system stability  and satisfactory performance in the presence of   unpredictable system inputs (or disturbances).  In risk  sensitive stochastic control,  disturbances are modeled as  random events and an exponential criterion of system   performance is used.  Feedback controls which optimize such risk sensitive criteria  provide better protection against rare disturbances which may cause very poor system  performance.  For example, in routing flows in data communication systems, the control  design seeks to avoid  long delays and buffer overflows due to  rare bursts of heavy  traffic.  Risk sensitive control theory also provides a natural link between stochastic  control theory and another widely used approach (robust  control) in which disturbances  are modeled  in a deterministic (non-random) manner.  ***",
