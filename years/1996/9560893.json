 "awd_abstract_narration": "9560893  Yadav         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on producing novel refractory microspheres for insulation applications. Insulation is an essential technology with a broad impact on almost all industries. Fuel effficiency, raw material usage, equipment size, equipment weight, and system reliability all depend on the properties of the insulation used in the system. Existing insulation materials have one or more of the following limitations: (1) excessive volume or weight; (2) material degradation at temperatures greater than 1000 degrees C; (3) low thermal shock resistance; and (4) high cost. This project will focus on producing refractory microspheres that feature low weight, low volume, high thermal shock resistance, low cost and the ability to work effectively at temperatures as high as 2,500 degrees C. During Phase I, the concept will be demonstrated. If approved, Phase II will optimize and field test the novel insulation system.         Thermal insulation is a major industry serving a wide range of residential and industrial application needs. Low and high temperature insulation is needed to maximize fuel efficiency in process industries, reduce heating and utility bills in residential markets, protect microelectronics and fragile devices from the adverse effects of heat, and ensure safety of personnel and property on fire-prone structures such as bridges and offshore oil rigs.",
