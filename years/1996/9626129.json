 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hai-Lung Dai of the University of Pennsylvania is supported by the   Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to continue his studies on van   der Waals (vdW) complexes. Intermolecular interactions that induce   electronic and vibrational energy transfer will be studied through vdW   complexes formed with the two molecules involved in the encounter.  The   vdW forces place the two molecules in a unique orientation and at a fixed   distance defined by the complex structure.  By monitoring the   fluorescence decay and emission spectra following optical excitation of   the complex, energy transfer dynamics can be examined with orientation   and energy specification.  Isomeric complex structures will be used to   enable the orientation effect to be studied.  Specifically, (a)   collision-induced electronic relaxation such as intersystem crossing will   be studied through monitoring laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) decay in   vdW complexes.  Molecular orbital dependence in electronic relaxation of   molecules will be characterized together with the effect of different   collision partners.  (b)  Degenerate four wave mixing (DFWM) will be   developed to study complexes with rapid nonradiative decay and low   fluorescence yield.  (c)  Structures and vdW modes will be determined   from LIF, DFWM and stimulated emission spectroscopy.  Models for   calculating intermolecular potentials will be tested against these   experimental measurements and used for searching isomeric structures of   the complexes.    This research deals with the problem of how energy flows within and among   vibrationally and electronically excited molecules.  The molecules of   study are incorporated in molecular clusters which are held together by   weak intermolecular vdW forces.  Vibrational or electronic excitation of   the component molecules will generally cause the complex to dissociate.    This dissociation process mimics the energy transfer that occurs between   colliding molecules.  The experiments with molecules embedded in a vdW   complex provide a measure of control over the reaction process that is   not available with molecular gases in which the molecules are randomly   oriented.  The experiment will provide information useful for the   understanding of the reactivity of different molecular orbitals, and for   the determination of the potential energy surface which characterizes the   reaction.  With this information it will be possible to devise novel   photochemical reaction pathways.",
