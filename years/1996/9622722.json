 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gedeon  9622722       Analog neural networks admit stationary, periodic and  chaotic solutions.  So far the stationary solutions have received  most attention of researchers.  However, in recent years the  importance of non-stationary patterns in brain became clear.  The  investigator studies networks which admit periodic orbits and  addresses the apparent discrepancy between discrete and  continuous time networks of this type.  While in continuous  networks one expects generally a convergence to a periodic orbit,  in discrete time networks there are stable stationary solutions.  The project investigates chaotic behaviour of a class of networks  with step-function nonlinearities.  These can be viewed as a  limiting case of a steep sigmoid nonlinearities and are easier to  handle analytically.  The delay in synaptic response of a neuron  is a recognized fact; if one wants to account for its affect the  appropriate model must be expressed in terms of delay  differential equation.  The investigator studies the  discretization of this equation and shows that this  finite-dimensional approximation captures the essential features  of the dynamics of the delay equation.       Artificial neural networks is an area on a crossroads  between artificial inteligence and neurobiology.  Mathematical  models play an important role in this area.  Neural networks try  to model some basic functions of brain (learning, recognizing  trained patterns) without trying to understand the intricate  details of how the neurons work on a chemical or physiological  level.  Neural networks are used today in many areas of apllied  science and engineering.  The network can be trained to recognize  a certain pattern, given slightly perturbed data.  This pattern  must be stationary, i.e. fixed in time.  On the other hand, there  is hardly any process in the brain which is stationary, and most  processes are periodic.  The investigator studies networks that  admit periodic patterns, to understand the relationship between  differen t models and see which one is the most suitable for  applications.  If one were able to train the networks to recognize  complicated patterns (in space and time), that would have an  immediate impact on robotics and artificial inteligence.",
