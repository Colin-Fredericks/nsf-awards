 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acceptance of an object-oriented approach to scientific  computing is being hindered by the performance differential  between programs written in traditional languages and those  written in object-oriented languages. These performance  issues stem from the limitations on static dependence  analysis and compiler optimization posed by the presence of  objects.    An approach to increasing the degree of optimization in  object-oriented environments is incorporating information  about the object semantics and performing runtime  optimizations.  As proved true for compiler optimization  using static dependence information,informal semantics and  intuition are inadequate.  A semantic foundation for  optimization which includes support for dynamic dependence  and for the richer data types exploited in object-oriented  languages provides an important foundation for advancing  compiler research.  The  semantic model studied in this  research is intended to unify reasoning both in the compiler  (static) environment and the runtime (dynamic)environment.  Support for dynamic object creation and even dynamic class  definition can be considered in a setting exploiting both  static and dynamic dependence information. The resulting  model, utilizing tools such as denotational semantics and  equational calculi, will allow the creation of automated  tools to assist in the development of advanced compiler  optimizations with the additional formal assurances that  these optimizations do not alter the meaning of the program.    The computational demands posed by computational biology  provide another realistic setting within which to study the  complexities of object-oriented parallel and distributed  program development and the concomitant optimization needs  for language systems.  The educational goals of this  research are to both alter the programming languages and  compiler curricula to address, at all levels, issues of  semantics, optimization, and the degree to which each affect  the other. The computational  biology work provides a  promising framework within which to study these issues.  Thus, the computational biology curricula is being developed  in parallel with the languages work.    This research is expected to contribute to an understanding  of the nature of program dependences; how different language  constructs and program usage contribute to different  patterns of dependence; and how these patterns can be  exploited in language design or in language translation.  Work in this area has already uncovered unsuspected  connections between lazy evaluation and imperative  languages.  Further study should provide insight into  relationships among languages in the context of their  interactions at runtime.  A goal of this research is to  support the mixing of languages without sacrificing the  performance of the program, allowing the programmer to  select the most appropriate language for the individual  parts of a problem. The fundamental notion of program  dependence is a natural basis on which to construct a system  supporting this style of programming.  ***",
