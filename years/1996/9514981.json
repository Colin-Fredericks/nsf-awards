It supports conferences at Northwestern University  during the summers of 1996, 1997, and 1998.  Each consists of two  week-long workshops, one concentrating on theoretical issues in  macroeconomics and the other on microeconomics.  The topics for  the three years will vary.  Areas that look promising for the  1996 macroeconomics workshop include: fertility and population  growth, institutions for dealing with income and employment risk,  and theoretical and computational methods for studying models  with heterogeneous agents.  Areas that look promising for the  1996 microeconomics workshop are: interactive learning in  economics and game theory, rational learning in repeated and  recurring environments, evolutionary learning by boundedly  rational agents, and the applications of learning models to  industries, auctions, etc.  The topics for the second and third  years of the macroeconomics workshop and the second year of the  microeconomics workshop will be decided at a later date.  On the  macro side, areas likely to be included are: acquired comparative  advantage and the dynamics of international trade, the long-run  distribution of income and wealth, technological change and  diffusion, monetary and fiscal policy in growing economies, human  capital accumulation and labor market dynamics, and the  computation of equilibria for dynamic models.  On the micro side,  areas that look promising are: the role of information in  auctions and asset pricing, contracts and the internal  organization of firms, and the empirical implications of  industrial organization models.  The political economy workshop  is planned for 1998.  Topics include formal political theory and  the formation of political institutions.",
