These new composites consist of a reinforcement phase plus a  matrix composed of alternate thin layers of two different  materials.  Layered structures are known to enhance  mechanical toughness, and thus, their use as the matrix,  along with the reinforcement phase, should enhance the  toughness of the overall composite.  The 3 year project  consists of composite processing, characterization, and  mechanics modeling.  The process-structure-property  interrelationships for several laminated matrix composite  systems will be studied. Fibers of interest are carbon, SiC,  and Al2O3. Matrix materials will be selected from carbon,  SiC, Si3N4, Al2O3, mullite, B13C2, Nb, and Re.  Based on the  results from the first two years, a preferred system will be  selected for detailed study and optimization in the third  year. We propose to identify the layer thicknesses and  material properties (thermal expansion, elastic modulus, and  strength) required to optimize the mechanical performance,  particularly fracture toughness and strength, of this new  class of composites.  %%%  The objective of the proposed research is to study the  interrelationships between the processing, structure, and  properties of a new class of ceramic matrix composites.
