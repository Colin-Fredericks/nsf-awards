 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cornell University is the recipient of ARI funding for the renovation of the Molecular Beam Expitaxy (MBE) facility into a class 1000 clean room.  Located in the Department of Electrical Engineering, and housed in Phillips Hall, this laboratory is presently dedicated to compound semiconductor research using MBE for material synthesis.  The facility plays an integral role in engineering, and serves several departments in addition to other Universities. Compound semiconductor wafers from the facility are used for research into faster transistors, improved semiconductor lasers and new understanding of fundamental semiconductor physics. Interdisciplinary research is expanding due to thrusts into III-nitride semiconductors. The operation of the MBE machines is limited by the lack of proper temperature and humidity control, and poor air cleanliness due to irreparable failure of air-handling equipment and improper facility design and operation. Once renovated, the MBE facility will impact research by improving wafer yield, and higher material quality that will permit collaborations with industry that are presently not feasible. User safety will improve by removing the conditions of heat and humidity that currently serve as a dangerous diversion in a laboratory where hazardous chemical and machines are used.  Outdated facilities, including antiquated fume hood and safety showers, will be replaced and ADA compliant. The renovated research space will house more students and visiting scientists, and will be able to accommodate the growth in undergraduate research  and new graduate level research courses. This project will enhance the strong reputation of Cornell's MBE program as it continues to attract the interest of scientists throughout the country who need access to compound semiconductor materials to meet stringent research requirements.",
