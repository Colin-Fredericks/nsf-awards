 "awd_abstract_narration": "Does the general public experience sharp discontinuity in their attitudes and behavior as a result of political changes initiated at the elite level?  The possibility that mass attitudes are quite stable during periods of tumultuous change can have two very different implications for the success of political and economic transitions.  In one instance, mass attitudes might be perfectly consistent with the success of the new institutions.  In this case, education and diffusion of information produce a citizenry well-versed in the norms of democratic capitalism.  On the other hand, mass attitudes could be out of synch with the political and economic revolution, in which case attitude stability may well undermine the changes in the long run.    This project evaluates the role played by attitude change in the transition from communist societies to democracy and free markets.  Specifically, the project will examine attitudinal change and stability in Hungary between 1989 and 1996.      To answer these questions about the public's role, analyses of survey data along with macro-level social and economic indicators collected previously will be subjected to secondary analysis.   Based on this work, the principal investigator together with his Hungarian collaborators will develop and field a national probability survey of current attitudes.  The final phase of the project will bring together Eastern and Western scholars investigating democratic transition in a series of conferences to examine the state of knowledge about transition processes.",
