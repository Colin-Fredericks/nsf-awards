 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  EEC-9603572  Oren    The power industry must undertake a managed redesign of the Nation's Power System so that it can adopt to deregulation and to rapid changes in the power requirements and economic conditions.  A planning grant was awarded last spring to study the feasibility of an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Power Systems Engineering to address the research needed to create the tools and models to aid in the technical design of a future high-performance electric power system.  A multi-university I/UCRC in Power Systems Engineering, involving Cornell University, The University of Wisconsin-Madison, The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and The University of California, Berkeley, and Howard University as an affiliate, is viable.    The research agenda for the Center will address: 1) Simulation Tools for Analysis of Alternative Paradigms for New Electricity Business; 2) Market Mechanisms for Competitive Electricity; 3) An Internet Platform for Simulating Competitive Bidding for Unist Commitment and Schedule; 4) Available Transfer Capability; 5) Data Calibration; and 6) Real-Time Control of Oscillations.    The Electric Power Research Institute is planning to cost share some of the activities.     The Center is being cost-shared with Dr. C. Singh, Program Director, Engineering Systems/Power Systems Program, Division of Electrical and Communications Systems.",
