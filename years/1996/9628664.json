 "awd_abstract_narration": "9628664  Crivello  A novel metal catalyzed isomerization/polymerization  reaction has been developed in which readily available and  inexpensive allyl ethers and related compounds can be  readily and efficiently polymerized to give high molecular  weight polymers.  Depending on the specific metal complex  selected, polymerization can be spontaneous and highly  exothermic, or require heat or light activation.    The polymerization of simple allyl, crotyl and cyclic and  acyclic vinyl acetals has been demonstrated.  Typical  examples of these monomers will be polymerized and the  effects of the structures of the metal carbonyl, the silane  and the monomers on the rate of polymerization and the  molecular weight of the resulting polymers will be  determined.  The progress of the polymerizations and their  rates will be followed using NMR, GPC and FT-IR methods.  Further, the structures, tacticities, glass transition  temperatures and, where appropriate, mechanical and thermal  properties of the resulting polymers will be fully  characterized.  Multifunctional monomers and oligomers  bearing pendant and terminal allyl and crotyl ethers will be  prepared and characterized, then polymerized using the  optimized catalysts and reaction conditions.  Similarly,  monomers bearing various functional groups including esters,  alcohols, carbonates, ethers, urethanes and amides will also  be prepared and their polymerizations using these novel  catalyst systems carried out.  %%%  One of the major aims of this project is to elucidate the  mechanism(s) of the isomerization/polymerizations .  Accordingly, where possible, the synthesis of appropriate  organometallic intermediates will be carried out and their  involvement in the polymerizations be determined.  Based on  these studies, novel and more efficient thermal and  photochemically activated catalyst systems will be designed  and employed.  Lastly, the application of this chemistry to  the preparation of linear and crosslinked polymers of  potential practica l and commerical interest will be  addressed.  Attempts will be made to prepare and  characterize films and castings of polymerized allyl ethers.  ***",
