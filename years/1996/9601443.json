 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the project is provide an account of the  sociolinguistic and ethnolinguistic boundaries for the three  ethnic communities in Warren County, NC: the African-American  community, the Native-American community, and the  European-American community. The complex nature of the  relationships between the communities offers an ideal  sociolinguistic laboratory for examining the effects of ethnic  boundaries on language change and variation.       Acoustic analysis of vowels will be conducted to pinpoint  inter- and intradialectal variation, and quantitatively based  covariance studies of a set of social and linguistic varieties  will provide a profile of the overlapping but distinctive dialect  systems. Interviews with members of all three communities will be  conducted using sociolinguist/native fieldworker teams to augment  the present corpus of speakers, which presently includes 36  Warren County speakers.       The project will provide data and analysis relating to three  major issues in sociolinguistics today. First, research will  provide current and refined information on the state of Southern  linguistic identity. Second, quantitative and qualitative  analysis will provide a closer look at the possible convergence  or divergence between African-American Vernacular English (AAVE)  and European-American Vernacular English (EAVE). Studies done in  large, urban cities reveal social influences on the variation and  change of vernacular English; the triracial community of Warren  county offers a vastly different social situation, that of an  agriculturally based rural community. The possible convergence  and divergence of the Native American community with either the  local AAVE or EAVE speech communities, vis-a-vis a separate  dialectal identity, will also provide crucial evidence pertaining  to the attempts of the Warren County Native American community to  meet regulations for federal recognition. A distinctive dialect  may lend credence to claims of cultural diversity for the Native   American community. Third, data and analysis of Warren County  speech will provide the linguistic community at large with a  clearer view of the nature of ethnic boundaries and language  variation. The social setting of Warren County's ethnic  boundaries offers a different, diverse, and culturally rich  perspective on language variation.",
