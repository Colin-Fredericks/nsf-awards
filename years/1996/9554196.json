 "awd_abstract_narration": "9554196  Brainard    An Invitational Conference for Female Faculty and Graduate Students  in Engineering will begin to address the low representation of  female faculty in engineering in the US.  This initiative will  increase the awareness of all deans of engineering regarding the  need to improve the institutional climate to promote the  identification, hiring and promotion of female faculty and to  examine the admissions and funding criteria for female graduate  students.  The conference will focus on the professional  development of female faculty and gradate students by identifying  strategies to improve grant writing and skills, increase their  publications and collaboration with colleagues, and to enhance  their mentoring and advising skills which will benefit their  students.  A total of 30 will be female faculty and 30 female  graduate students will participate in the conference.  An  assessment will be conducted to determine the benefit of the  conference and to determine the need to offer this training on a  broader scope.    The anticipated outcome of this project is to effect a positive  change in the engineering infrastructure which will be equally  conductive to female and male faculty and graduate students.  To  this end, conference proceedings including a set of recommendations  to facilitate this process will be disseminated to all US deans of  engineering, participants and other female faculty who are members  of WEPAN, AWIS and ASEE.  WEPAN, Women in Engineering Advocates  Network will continue to mark, print and disseminate the conference  proceedings and recommendations after the grant period ends.",
