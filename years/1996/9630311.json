 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will develop a prototype database of  published surveys of animal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).  Surveys of genetic variation in natural populations have  been a major component of research in population biology and  systematics. The data from these surveys are valuable  resource for further research and for applications in  conservation biology.  Animal mtDNA surveys are appropriate  targets for standardized methods of representation and  analysis. Variation in mtDNA reflects a hierarchy of  maternal lineages, which often exhibit considerable temporal  and geographical structure. Although surveys of mtDNA  variation may employ any of several methods to detect  variation (DNA sequencing, RFLP, DGGE, SSCP), there are  standard statistical quantities that can be calculated from  any of these data, as well as standard methods for  interpreting these statistics.    The investigators will identify authors of animal mtDNA  surveys by literature searches, and contact them with a  request for data. When necessary (and feasible), they will  also extract data from printed tables in published articles  and reports. The raw data will first be assembled as a  hierarchical database in which the data for each survey will  consist of records for individual animals that include  genetic and other biological data. An object database will  be developed in which each survey will be represented as an  object that includes both data and a set of methods for  manipulating and representing the data. The methods will  provide both statistical and graphical representations of  population genetics surveys that can be directly compared.  Database programming will done in C++, a standard object  oriented programming language, and will use PARODY, a  database management system that supports persistent data  objects.    The investigators will test the functionality of the  prototype object database with an application that requires  a uniform representation of population surveys that conforms  to a single sta tistical model. This application will detect  patterns in the geographic distributions of mtDNA variation  that are shared among multiple species, and will assess  their statistical significance by performing a meta-  analysis. Previous studies utilizing graphical comparisons  of the geographic distributions of mtDNA variation for  multiple species have revealed similarities that have been  interpreted as evidence for the influence of common  historical and environmental forces. However this graphical  approach is not based on any statistical model. The object  database will enable a new approach to the analysis of  multiple population genetic surveys, based on the  statistical principles of meta-analysis.",
