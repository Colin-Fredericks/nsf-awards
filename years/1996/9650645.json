 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing a computer classroom in which mathematics and statistics classes meet to use interactive computer activities. The laboratory has three main objectives:  (1) to increase the accessibility of computer classroom time for computer activities that are in current use, (2) to meet the increasing demands of mathematics and statistics instructors for facilities to offer these kinds of activities in their courses, and (3) to promote the use of new software technology to acquire, modify, and refine existing activities and to create new activities for mathematics and statistics classes. The third of these is focusing on newly available software called Mathwright. This is an authoring tool for highly developed windows style interactive lessons called workbooks. Mathwright workbooks feature high quality graphics, animation, sound, data entry and manipulation, and symbolic operations in a point and click setting. Mathwright enables the teacher to create these workbooks using an interactive composition facility. The project is providing a development site for these workbooks, holding a faculty workshop on Mathwright software, and providing a laboratory assistant trained to use Mathwright and to retrieve Mathwright activities from the national library. They are also holding a local conference to demonstrate our Mathwright creations for faculty from other institutions.",
