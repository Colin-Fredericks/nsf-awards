 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates ethical issues arising from the  commercial exploitation of emerging genetic technologies.  In the  near to far future, it is likely that a wide range of genetic  tests will become available to detect disease or genetic  predisposition or to locate individual position along the normal  range of distribution of various traits.  Genetic interventions  will include both direct gene change and the creation of drugs to  mimic or change genetic expression.  Commercialization of these  technologies will transform the market.  Depending on public  policy and personal choices, individuals may be able to enhance  their or their progeny's natural endowments, or to sell copies of  their genes.  As this market expands, other social institutions,  like families and educational systems, will feel the effects.  The objectives of this project are (1) to identify the chief  ethical issues that will arise as market forces play an  increasing role in the deployment of genetic technologies; and  (2) to formulate the types of ethical considerations that ought  to be taken into account by policy makers in deciding whether or  in what ways to regulate the genetic marketplace.  The project  methodology is reflective ethical analysis (REA).  REA involves  the identification and careful reconstruction of public and  policy debates concerning how individual and social institutions  should respond to these new developments.  The ethical principles  and factual disputes underlying these positions are identified.  Relevant existing empirical studies are examined to respond to  what may have been taken to be ethical disputes.  The need for  additional empirical research is noted.  Techniques for balancing  conflicting ethical principles are applied to remaining ethical  conflicts.  In cases of intractable disagreements, unacceptable  options may still be excluded and a range of ethically acceptable  options may be identified.  Research results will be prepared for  publication in at least two primary articles dealing with the two  objectives above.  They will meet high standards of scholarship,  but they will also be presented in a form which is accessible to  a broad audience of policy advisors and policy makers.  Additional publications targeted at specific professional and lay  audiences will also be prepared.",
