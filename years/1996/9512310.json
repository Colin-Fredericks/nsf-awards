 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Southwestern Research Station (SWRS) of the American  Museum of Natural History (AMNH), located in southeastern  Arizona, offers field biologists from numerous U.S. and  international institutions a field research facility with  access to a wide range of biological communities and a great  diversity of species.  The primary objective of the Station  is providing accommodations and scientific facilities to  support research at a remote site.    This project addresses a variety of housing needs for  researchers working at the Station.  The duplex residence  will solve housing problems, at various times of the year,  for a diverse scientific clientele.  First, it will provide  additional sleeping quarters for up to twelve individuals,  relieving acute crowding during peak use by scientists in  spring and summer.  Second, as a winterized building with  kitchenettes in each unit, it will serve as winter (November-  March) housing for researchers when the dinning room is  closed for the season.   Third, it will be used to house  researchers and their assistants who are engaged in studies  on nocturnal organisms, providing an isolated, quiet  location for daytime sleeping.  And, fourth, by  incorporating two sleeping areas in each unit, the duplex  will be appropriate housing for families with children who  are the Station for extended periods.  The building will  provide housing conditions not currently available at SWRS,  thus facilitating use of the Station by scientists, and  creating opportunities not previously available.",
