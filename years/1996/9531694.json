 "awd_abstract_narration": "9531694  Meerkov   This research concerns the application of rigorous mathematical analysis from systems theory to improve output rate of production lines by better allocation of resources.  It is an innovative approach to the \"bottleneck \" problem.  The researchers have developed a theory of improvability, where a production system is considered improvable  under constraints if limited resources such as work -in-process  or workforce can be redistributed so that a performance index (usually production rate) can be increased.  Here, improvement, rather than optimality, is looked for, since it is often impossible to determine optimality due to the extremely complex mathematical nature of production systems.  The research will also investigate unconstrained improvability, namely determining the machine, device, or assembly station that impedes the systems performance in the strongest manner, i.e., the bottleneck.   The approach of the research is based on sound mathematical principles which result in usable operating rules for the \"shop\" floor.  The researchers have excellent industry ties, and the theoretical results are constantly evaluated in real industrial environments.",
