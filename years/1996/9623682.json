The probes will  be  microwaves  and ultrasound for UPt3, and an oscillating  magnetic  field and ultrasound for Helium-3. The temperature dependence  of  the  microwave impedance of Upt3 will be studied using a recently  developed  variable-frequency, cryogenic, microwave spectrometer.  This will allow determination of the temperature-dependent energy  gap  and  will  enable  a  search for collective  modes  in  this  material.  Helium-3  shear  waves  and  their  interaction   with  collective  modes  will be investigated using a unique  variable-  path-length sound cell developed in this laboratory.  Finally,  a  search  will be performed for evidence of interaction between  an  oscillating magnetic field and various collective modes in Helium-  3.  %%%  Superconductivity   is   finding   on   increasing   number    of  applications,  including high-field magnets, sensitive  magnetic-  field  detectors and high-speed computers. Most  of  the  present  interest  surrounds  the high-temperature superconductors.  These  materials,   which   may   be  referred  to   as   unconventional  superconductors,  are  thought to derive  their  properties  from  mechanisms   that   differ  from  those  found  in   conventional  superconductors.  Two  other  classes  of  materials  also   show  unconventional  behavior: the rare isotope of  helium  (Helium-3)  and  a  uranium-platinum compound (UPt3). These materials are  of  unique  scientific interest as well as being testing grounds  for  developing    an    understanding   of   other   non-conventional  superconductors (including the high-Tc materials).  This  project  will  employ  high-frequency  probes,  including  microwaves  and  ultrasound, to study excitation phenomena in these mat erials  and  thence  derive an understanding of the unconventional  nature  of  their superconductivity and superfluidity  ***",
