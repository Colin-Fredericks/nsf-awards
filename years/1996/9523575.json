 "awd_abstract_narration": "Joseph L. Knee is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry   Program to study the spectroscopy and dynamics of molecular clusters   using pump-probe threshold photoelectron spectroscopy.  Threshold   photoelectron spectroscopy is used as a state selective probe of excited   state dynamics by monitoring the time evolution of the photoelectron   spectrum as a function of pump-probe laser delay.  By implementing mass   analyzed threshold ionization spectroscopy (MATI), such studies can be   done with mass resolution; a reflectron mass spectrometer will be built   for this purpose.  Fluorene-Ar(subn) clusters will be used to study   intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR) and vibrational   predissociation (VP) in van der waals complexes.  The cluster size, n,   will be varied in order to investigate cluster size influence on IVR and   VP dynamics. MATI experiments will be carried out which will distinguish   between different cluster conformations, allowing dynamic measurements of   processes such as conformer interconversions.  Cation cluster   spectroscopy will be another important component to these studies.  Also,   proton transfer in Naphthol-(NHsub3)subn and other hydrogen-bonded   systems will be studied.    Many studies have been completed on binary and tertiary complexes, but   for clusters of four or more, the quantity and quality of information   available is much less.  Larger clusters are important to study if one is   interested in learning about solution phase behavior such as how solvents   can participate in and mediate chemical reactions, e.g., the excited   state proton transfer between 1-Naththol and ammonia requires at least   four ammonia molecules complexed to the naphthol to occur.  To learn   about cluster structure and dynamics in larger clusters, one has to   overcome problems of complexity and mass selectivity.",
