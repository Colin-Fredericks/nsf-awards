Lin, Frank    California State University - San Bernadino (CSUSB)    CISE Minority Institutions Infrastructure:  Infrastructure Improvement to Increase Access for Minorities to CISE Career    The purpose of this NSF CISE MII planning grant proposal is to provide minority students enrolled in the CISE disciplines of Computer and Information Science at California State University, San Bernadino (CSUSB), with facilities to pursue careers in the CISE fields.  To achieve this goal, this planning grant will develop an NSF MII proposal and integrate the NSF funding with existing and newly developed funding sources necessary for the proposed quality instruction and improved minority opportunities.  These funding sources involve vendor participation and support, including minority owned small business vendors.  A number of specific strategic program areas have been identified :     -improved minority recruitment and retention into the CISE disciplines, using both the pool of  students at CSUSB and recruitment of otherwise unsupported minority students;      -upgrades and innovations in curriculum to produce minority graduates with both an industrial  and an advanced degree path open to them;      -establishment of facilities to teach modern data communications;   measures to address the problems faced by minority students with physical disabilities;      -means to improve minority student access to facilities from remote (home) sites; and      -upgrades to general infrastructure in terms of computers and communications to support these  programs",
