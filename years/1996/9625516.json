 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to provide a forum for six  faculty members from various institutions to present results  of their NSF-supported research in undergraduate engineering  education. The Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE'95)  will bring together approximately 400 professors, engineers,  information specialists, K-12 teachers, graduate students,  and others involved in the advancement of engineering  education for an intense three days of interaction. With the  theme \"Engineering Education for the 21 st Century,\" the  conference will be focusing on new technologies and methods  for improving engineering education. Thus the showcase will  provide an excellent opportunity for dissemination of  research results to a wide and appropriate community of  scholars and practitioners.    Inviting PI's who have developed exemplary products such as  computer-based curricula, textbooks, and curricula which  attract and retain traditionally underrepresented  populations in the engineering disciplines, not only  showcases NSF-supported educational research, but also  provides opportunities for one-on-one interaction, hands-on  interactive experiences, stimulating exchanges of ideas, and  enhancements in the uses of innovations in science,  mathematics, engineering and technology education at all  levels.",
