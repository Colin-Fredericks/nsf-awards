 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the research of a cultural anthropologist from the University of California-Los Angeles.  The project is to maintain and develop a data-base of demographic information about a small group of foragers known as the Hadza, in Tanzania.  The PI and other collaborators have conducted research among this group for the past 10 years.  The questions to be asked concern the nature of the local women's reproductive histories to test hypotheses relating men's reputations and their wife's fertility, the relation of a woman's size and reproductive history, and the nature of the desired offspring set size and gender composition.    In addition a  linguist will study the Hadza language with the goal of recording its distinctive features, analyzing its relations with other regional languages (none have been recognized so far), and recording indigenous folk-lore.  This research is important because the group to be studied represents one of the few and fast vanishing hunter-gatherer societies still existing in the world.  The data on the reproductive behavior and language of these people represent a valuable data-base to be used for comparative studies of human language, reproduction and family planning.",
