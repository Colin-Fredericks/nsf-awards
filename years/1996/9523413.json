 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent results in laser-solid interactions indicate that there is a   convenient way to propel large molecules into the gas phase with little   or no degradation.  This particularly exciting new method,   matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), has enormously   expanded the mass range for the spectroscopy of high molecular weight   biomolecules.   No adequate theory is yet available to explain the entire   method, or even parts of it like co-crystallization or ion formation.    The proposal plans to study the chemistry and physics of the mechanisms   that produce the sample crystals, energize, eject, and ionize the   molecules from condensed molecular samples with emphasis on the MALDI   experiments on proteins and nucleic acids.  Two limits of the ejection   process will be explored:  the hydrodynamic (HD) limit and the molecular   dynamic (MD) limit.  The two descriptions complement each other in terms   of time scales (<200 ps for MD vs. 1 ns to 100 ns for HD) and accessible   information (molecular vs. bulk properties).     Large biomolecules are hard or impossible to evaporate since they tend to   decompose before reaching high-enoughtemperature.  The most accurate   spectroscopic methods, however, rely on gas phase molecules. A recently   discovered phenomenon, called matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization   (MALDI), gets around this problem by embedding the large molecules into   an easy-to-evaporate matrix that can be excited by pulsed laser   radiation.  The MALDI method has provided unprecedented accuracy in the   molecular mass determination of large proteins and other biomolecules.    Despite the great benefits of this method, understanding of the   underlying processes is lagging behind. The proposal plans to explore the   chemistry and physics of the mechanisms that produce the sample crystals,   energize, eject, and ionize the molecules from condensed molecular   samples with emphasis on the MALDI experiments on proteins and nucleic   acids.  Improved understanding of the basic phenomena involved will help   to extend the capabilities of MALDI for a larger group of important   biomolecules.",
