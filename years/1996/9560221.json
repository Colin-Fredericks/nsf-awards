 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address new computer-aided-design (CAD) tools for manufacturing of microsensors and other microelectromechanical (MEM) devices.  These MEMCAD tools are an innovative enabling technology consisting of a CAD software tool set tailored for MEM systems.  In addition, they may also find use for microelectronic devices.       MEMCAD is an integrated software system consisting of databases, simulators, a solid modeler, and an intuitive graphic user-interface for the workstation environment.  It incorporates a wealth of empirical manufacturing data, which feed state-of-the-art simulation tools.  Using MEMCAD, process engineers and designers conceptualize, design, simulate, and optimize the performance of MEM devices from the same underlying knowledge base.  Phase I will develop the architecture of MEMCAD technology armed with anisotropic etching process technology and define the specific components needed to perform these functions.  A preliminary prototype of MEMCAD specific to bulk micromachining will be assembled and benchmarked.  Phase II would then assemble, test, and commercialize a complete MEMCAD system.       Anticipated benefits are lower prices for MEM system devices and faster introduction of these devices into use through lower development costs.  Commercial applications of these software tools are the design and development of MEM system devices such as sensors, actuators, and integrated circuits.",
