 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Memphis is utilizing this new instructional computer laboratory for instruction in the core sequence of courses Calculus I, II, and III, Differential Equations, and Linear Algebra. This sequence has a broad student clientele. Mathematics and Applied Mathematics majors, including all pre-service secondary Mathematics teachers, and all Mechanical, Civil, and Electrical Engineering, and Engineering Technology students take the entire sequence. Other majors which take at least two of the courses within the sequence include Computer Science, Statistics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. The average combined enrollment is approximately 500 students per semester. Approximately half of our students are women, 20% are African - American.    The purpose of this project is to enable the department to integrate technology with instruction throughout the sequence, by adding a PC lab component to each of the courses. The creation of two computer laboratory rooms is allowing each section within the sequence to use the laboratory weekly (or bi-weekly, as appropriate), and ensure that at most two students share any one machine. Adding a lab component to the entire sequence of courses is allowing the Department to (i) more fully incorporate the Rule of Three in the calculus courses, (ii) modernize the linear algebra course along the guidelines of the Linear Algebra Curriculum Study Group, (iii) modernize the differential equations course through adoption of a modeling approach and (iv) provide a solid base of technological literacy early in their academic careers for this broad group of science students.",
