 "awd_abstract_narration": "Using molecular approaches, scientists have recently isolated disease-linked genes, mapped complicated traits in plants, and identified homologous genes in numerous species. Much of the information generated now comes from massive DNA sequencing projects taking place around the world. The newest technology for DNA sequencing employs fluorescent dyes to detect the sequencing products, an important advance that will be used for many years to come. However, the equipment needed for the separation and detection of the fluorescently labeled products is prohibitively expensive. Therefore, this project arranges for the purchase of two DNA sequencers for use in an advanced molecular biology laboratory class, enabling undergraduate students to train in this new technology.   This equipment permits students to sequence unique DNA fragments, compare these results to known sequences, and submit the cloned DNA to central collection sites, making this information available for research. This addition to the undergraduate laboratory is a logical next step in the current molecular biology course, making it possible for students to make an important contribution to the scientific community, which would undoubtedly increase their interest in the future of biological endeavors.   This equipment can also be used in undergraduate research in a number of laboratories in the department. Initial steps are being taken to offer use of this equipment for undergraduate teaching by other colleges in the area, as well as in demonstrations for high school students and teachers. This project is likely to affect at least 200 undergraduate students, college educators, precollege students, and teachers during the 2 years of funding.",
