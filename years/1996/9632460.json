This project  will investigate the hypothesis that differing physical processes  which control the advection of water and zooplankton from the Gulf  of Maine onto different regions of the bank during the winter, and  differences in growth and mortality patterns of the target copepod  species within the different regions of the bank, regulate the  population sizes they attain during the spring and early summer. As  part of the U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field Studies, Phase 2  program this project will focus on  egg production, growth, and  mortality of Calanus finmarchicus and Pseudocalanus spp.. This  project  will determine:  (1) the recruitment of Calanus and  Pseudocalanus on Georges Bank during the winter/spring period, as  inferred from the distribution of nauplii and early copepodites  collected with pump samples during the broad scale surveys; (2) the  spatial, seasonal and interannual variation in egg production and  birth rates for the dominant copepod species; (3) the spatial,  seasonal and internal variations in egg viability, egg and naupliar  mortality rates, and naupliar development rates; and (4) whether  egg and naupliar mortality rates are correlated with abundances of  potential predators.  ***",
