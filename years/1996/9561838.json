 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide a basic understanding of a new machining process called Electrochemical Orbital Abrading (ECOA).  Advanced materials, such as high temperature metal matrix composites, have properties affording advantageous performance parameters but which are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to machine.  The ECOA machining process combines several materials removal processes to achieve a viable, economic machining technology for complex shapes and advanced materials.  Phase I will determine feasibility of the ECOA process as measured by dimensional accuracy, surface integrity assessments,and surface finish measurements.  Research will focus on basic factors which influence ECOA.  Electrolyte, tooling, and process parameters will be optimized, and the effort will examine more complex configurations.  The electrochemical removal mechanism, electrochemical grinding characteristics, and the orbital abrasion action will be investigated in a combined configuration to establish feasibility of maintaining a balance among these actions.       By virtue of anticipated advantages in fast, low-stock removal with excellent surface finish and integrity, ECOA is expected to find applications for a very broad cross section of traditional materials and configurations as generic as tool and diemaking for casting, forging, stamping, plastic molding, etc.  An important application is machining of advanced materials in industries such as advanced propulsion engines where serious machining problems are likely to emerge with advanced materials.",
