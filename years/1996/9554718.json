 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is intended to promote a new style of differential   equations instruction, one that emphasizes concepts and applications   and one that involves faculty members from both the mathematics and   engineering communities. We will share the results of the Boston   University Differential Equations Project in developing and   implementing a radical revision of the traditional sophomore-level   differential equations course designed to achieve these goals.  The   project will also feature presentations from an engineer who teaches   courses that depend heavily on the differential equations course.    To emphasize the way in which differential equations are used   throughout a student's education, participants will take part in   collaborative activities in small groups that include both   engineering and mathematics faculty members.  The goal is to promote   a style of differential equations instruction that better engages   and serves students throughout their college and professional careers.",
