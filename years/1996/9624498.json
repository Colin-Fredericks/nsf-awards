 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project investigates issues in memory hierarchy design and proposes solutions  to bridge the increasing performance gap between the processor and memory.  By  observing the unequal time needed to perform cache tag access/comparison and to  access cache data, this path imbalance can be exploited to achieve a more  performance optimal cache design.  The basic idea is to use an additional tag  array record the status and location of the recently used lines in the cache data  array.  By recording the cache line locations in this subset of the tag array,  the data access is decoupled from the tag access/comparison path for a shorter  overall cache access time.  In a multiprocessor system, cache coherence  activities incur extra traffic to the heavily-loaded snooping bus and impose  additional latency in accessing the data.  By observing that references to the  same memory location are often ordered at the software level, frequently  rendering cache coherence activities are unnecessary and can be deferred until  at the proper synchronization point.    The infrastructure required, including a multiprocessor tracing facility,  multiple-issue out-of-order execution processor models, and various memory  hierarchy models, will be developed in this project.  These tools will be  enhanced with graphical user interfaces and used for instructional purposes to  provide students with hands-on experience in evaluating difference architectural  design tradeoffs.",
