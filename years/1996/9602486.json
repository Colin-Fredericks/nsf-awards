 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-U.K. collaboration  between Gerald J. Stubbs of Vanderbilt University and T.  Michael Wilson of the Crop Research Institute in Scotland.  the objective of their research is to determine the three-  dimensional structure of furoviruses in molecular detail.  The project is related to Dr. Stubbs research on the  structure of a wide variety of different, unrelated helical  plant viruses.  Furoviruses have unique genetic structures, viral host  interactions and transmission modes, and low levels of coat  protein sequence homology with other viruses.  Sequence  comparisons indicate that furovirus RNA binding is very  different from that of other helical viruses.  The  structures of these viruses will be important in  understanding the nature of host-viral interactions,  specificity, vector transmission, and protein-nucleic acid  interactions.  The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration his  expertise in structural biology.  This is complemented by  the U.K. investigator's expertise in virology and his  research on furoviruses.  The project will advance our  understanding of the molecular structures of helical plant  viruses and will eventually be used in applied studies of  disease resistant plants.",
