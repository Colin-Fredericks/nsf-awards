 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for support for a program to make high resolution  studies of variations in the concentration of methane, the oxygen-  isotope composition of paleoatmospheric oxygen, and the total gas  content of deep Antarctic ice cores.  Studies of the  concentration and isotopic composition of air in the firn of the  Antarctic ice sheet will also be continued.  One objective of  this work is to use the methane concentration and oxygen-isotope  composition of oxygen of air in ice as time-stratigraphic markers  for the precise intercorrelation of Greenland and Antarctic ice  cores as well as the correlation of ice cores to other climatic  records.  A second objective is to use variations in the  concentration and interhemispheric gradient of methane measured  in Greenland and Antarctic ice cores to deduce changes in  continental climates and biogeochemistry on which the atmospheric  methane distribution depends.  A third objective is to use data  on the variability of total gas content in the Siple Dome ice  core to reconstruct aspects of the glacial history of West  Antarctica during the last glacial maximum.  The fourth objective  is to participate in collaborative studies of firn air chemistry  at Vostok, Siple Dome, and South Pole which will yield much new  information about gas trapping in ice as well as the  concentration history and isotopic composition of greenhouse  gases, oxygen, trace biogenic gases and trace anthropogenic gases  during the last 100 years.",
