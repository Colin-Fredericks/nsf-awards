 "awd_abstract_narration": "Agents must reason and act in an uncertain world. The standard approach to representing this  uncertainty is to use probability.  While probability has many advantages, there are situations  where it seems inappropriate or unnecessary.  The  long-term goal of this project is to  understand to what extent we can maintain the benefits of probability while using more  qualitative approaches. The focus is on one measure of belief, called a plausibility measure,  where the plausibility of an event is just an element in some partially-ordered space.  Plausibility measures generalize the bestknown approaches in the literature, including  probability, possibility (based on fuzzy logic), and Dempster-Shafer belief functions. Four main  lines of investigation are being pursued:   (1) Default reasoning---using plausibility to give  semantics to defaults such  ``birds typically (or normally) fly''.  (2) Belief dynamics---using plausibility to capture an  agent's beliefs, and defining an appropriate notion of conditioning to capture how these  beliefs change over time.  (3) Qualitative decision theory---using plausibility as a basis for  a qualitative approach to  decision making.  (4) Complexity issues---investigating whether  qualitative reasoning using plausibility is  easier than more quantitative reasoning.   This  research should help provide tools for a powerful, yet easy-touse, framework for representing  uncertainty.  It is hoped that a combination of qualitative and quantitative reasoning under  uncertainty will be more effective in providing reasoning ability to intelligent agents than  either approach used alone.  ***",
