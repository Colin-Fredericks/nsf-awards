 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past decade, artificial intelligence concepts and techniques have been productively applied to diverse aspects of manufacturing decision-making, ranging from product and process development, to production management, to process diagnosis and quality control.  Artificial intelligence techniques will continue to impact design and manufacturing.  In fact, they are an important -  even necessary - part of the dreams shared by concepts such as lean manufacturing, agile manufacturing, virtual manufacturing, computer-integrated  manufacturing and design.  Because artificial intelligence is still a field in which there is much fundamental research required to bring to fruition exciting developments that will prove useful in these fields and because this research might as well be focused on the most productive areas, it is a good time to bring together experts and practitioners in both artificial intelligence and manufacturing, to bridge gaps between problem and solution perspectives, build better mutual understanding of important research challenges and technical potential in the field, break down cultural barriers that now exist, and foster future interaction and collaboration between the two communities.    Together, manufacturing and artificial intelligence researchers and practitioners will work to facilitate the realization of truly intelligent manufacturing systems.",
