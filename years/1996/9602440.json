 "awd_abstract_narration": "South Carolina Advanced Technological Education (SC ATE) Center of Excellence    The South Carolina Advanced Technological Education (SC ATE) Center of Excellence addresses expanding the pool of skilled technicians in advanced engineering technology fields to aid the state's and the nation's manufacturing industries in remaining competitive in the global marketplace. The SC ATE Center seeks to create a learning environment which models the new technologically sophisticated work milieu rather than simply teaching about it. Objectives are focused in three broad areas including curriculum reform, program improvement, and faculty development. Curriculum reform centers on developing integrated engineering technology core curricula using a systems-based approach; program improvement encompasses recruitment/retention reforms as well as the development of an electronic communications infrastructure for state-wide curriculum design and delivery; and faculty development emphasizes the use of interdisciplinary/intercampus teams for designing and implementing curriculum reforms. The primary target audience of the SC ATE Center is technical college students enrolled in, or desiring to enroll in, engineering technology programs with a particular emphasis on attracting women and underrepresented minorities. The Center seeks to impact the educational pipeline from middle school through the baccalaureate level. A particular emphasis involves working with Clemson University and other four-year colleges to help prepare the middle and secondary school technology teachers of the future. Collaborative partnerships encompass over twenty-five educational, governmental, and business/industrial entities including the State Department of Education, Clemson University, South Carolina State University, the Virginia Community College System, the Governor's Math/Science Advisory Board, the Governor's Commission on Women, the SC Department of Commerce, AMP, Inc., BellSouth Telecommunications Inc., Michelin North America, Bose  Corporation, Robert Bosch Corporation, and NCR Corporation. A strong evaluation component, headed by the Academy for Educational Development, will facilitate the development of program improvement processes and curriculum products which will have a significant impact on engineering technology education nation wide.",
