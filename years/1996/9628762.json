 "awd_abstract_narration": "9628762  Wang    An International Conference on Molecular Beam Epitaxy(MBE) is being held to address new,  more microscopic aspects of MBE phenomena.  Chemical kinetic reactions and mechanisms in  critical aspects of interfaces, thin film surface evolution and continuous film development  during early stages of epitaxy of both compound and elemental semiconductors ar  e being addressed through advanced processing and characterization techniques being studied  by  a new generation of young scientists.  Current topics in semiconductor materials growth  under lattice mismatch conditions, and related in situ advanced materials characterization  are an integral part of the conference.  There will be an opportunity to a  ssess the field, and to establish ties between universities, research institutions, and  industry.  It is expected that top scientists in the field will attend, and that the  Conference will provide an effective forum to discuss and delineate critical scientific  issues in this important research area, and to consider and define the approaches and te  chniques needed to address them.  %%%   An evaluation of the progress and status of Molecular Beam Epitaxy and related materials  processing and characterization issues, especially critical materials research areas of  hetero-epitaxy, processing, and the relationship of materials research to device and  circuit fabrication along with current assessments of the most important developments  in this field will be of great value to the understanding and enhanced utilization of  advanced materials in the field of electronics and photonics.  ***      _",
