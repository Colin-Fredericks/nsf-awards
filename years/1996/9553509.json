The program will introduce students to discrete mathematics, an accessible field with many applications and many open problems; will increase students' problem solving ability; will expose them to a wide variety of mathematical scientists as role models; and will encourage them to consider careers in mathematics and the sciences.  Workshops conducted by college faculty will focus on applications of graphs, algorithms in graph theory, iteration and fractals, and applications.  A variety of technology environments will be used for explorations and demonstrations related to these topics.  Research projects will be mentored by university and industry mathematicians and computer scientists.  The program will include speakers from industry, field trips, career orientation workshops and discussions of ethics in the mathematical sciences. Follow up sessions will be held on four Saturdays during the school year.",
