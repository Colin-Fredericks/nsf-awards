The first workshop, to be held in   late 1996 in Ensenada, Mexico, will have as its products the following:  a   state of the art review, to be compiled and produced as a book, a   discussion of the principal research themes for the group, and the division   of labor between working groups for the production of a Phase II proposal   to the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI).  The   second workshop, to be held in early 1997 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, will   consist of a smaller group that meets to integrate the results of the   working groups and draft the actual Phase II proposal.  The preliminary   comprehensive objective for a Phase II project is a latitudinal comparison   of the effects of the variations in incident UV radiation at the   individual, population, community, and ecosystem levels.  This goal will be   achieved through the following sub-objectives:  the characterization of   subsurface UV spectral irradiance; the quantification of the impact of   environmental UV on biogeochemical processes with respect to spectral   composition, intensity and duration of exposure; the quantification of the   impact of UV-B radiation on the biology and bio-diversity of marine   planktonic ecosystems up to decadal exposure times, with emphasis on   phytoplankton and pelagic primary production, and measurements of possible   UV-induced photoinhibition; and finally the training of local personnel to   carry out a coordinated program of measurements and analysis.  The proposed   program would identify key areas of study at different levels in the   ecosystems; coordinate efforts, sampling, and methods to be used for   inter-site comparisons; and take advantage of existing ecosystem study   sites (e.g. the Palmer LTER site).  Facilities belonging to the following   institution s might be used during Phase II:  Argentine Antarctic Institute;   Austral Center for Scientific Research, Argentina; Autonomous University of   Baja California, Mexico; Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, Canada;   Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education of Ensenada, Mexico;  National Autonomous University of Mexico in Yucat=E1n; National Institute fo=   r  =46isheries Development, Chile; National Institute for Fisheries Research an=   d  Development, Argentina; National Scientific Research Institute of the   University of Qu=E9bec, Canada; Oceanographic Institute, University of Sao   Paulo, Brazil; Scripps Institute of Oceanography, in the United States;   Smithsonian Institute (facilities in Belize, C.A., and Maryland); and the   University of San Francisco, USA.  These institutions are all principally   located in countries that are members of the IAI, a United States   initiative to stimulate global change research among the scientific   institutions of the Americas.  The National Science Foundation is the   designated U.S. Government agency to carry out the U.S. responsibilities   within the IAI.  %%%  This proposal requests support for two international scientific meetings on   the effects of ultra-violet radiation on aquatic ecosystems.  The first   workshop, to be held in late 1996 in Ensenada, Mexico, will have as its   products the following:  a state of the art review, to be compiled and   produced as a book, a discussion of the principal research themes for the   group, and the division of labor between working groups for the production of   a Phase II proposal to the Inter-American Institute for Global Change   Research (IAI).  The second workshop, to be held in early 1997 in Buenos   Aires, Argentina, will consist of a smaller group that meets to integrate the   results of the working groups and draft the actual Phase II proposal. The   preliminary comprehensive objective for a Phase II project is a comparison of   the effects of UV radiation on ecosystems at variou s levels. The proposed   program would identify key areas of study, coordinate methods to be used for   inter-site comparisons, and take advantage of existingecosyst em study sites   (e.g. the Long Term Ecological Research sites).  Facilities belonging to the   following institutions might be used during Phase II: Argentine Antarctic   Institute; Austral Center for Scientific Research, Argentina; Autonomous   University of Baja California, Mexico; Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences,   Canada; Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education of Ensenada,   Mexico; National Autonomous University of Mexico in Yucat=E1n; National   Institute for Fisheries Development, Chile; National Institute for Fisheries   Research and Development, Argentina; National Scientific Research Institute   of the University of Qu=E9bec, Canada= ;  Oceanographic Institute, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil; Scripps Institute   of Oceanography, in the United States; Smithsonian Institute (facilities in   Belize, C.A., and Maryland); and the University of San Francisco, USA.
