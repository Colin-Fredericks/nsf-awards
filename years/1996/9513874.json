Fungi play vital roles  in forest and grassland systems, yet knowledge of species  diversity and distribution of fungi in many areas of the  world is sparse compared to information available on nearly  all animal and plant groups.  The situation is especially  critical in China where little is known about the  biodiversity and biogeography of Chinese fungi.   This  project is the first study designed to obtain biodiversity  data for Chinese fungi that are comparable with information  from other parts of the world.    During the two year study, US and Chinese scientists will   conduct cooperative research  on the biological diversity of macrofungi in China and   undertake comparisons with  the mycotas of eastern North America and Central America.   The proposed research  requires field work in both the US and China to sample   fungal biodiversity and to collect  materials for DNA analyses as well as laboratory work to   assay genetic divergence  among allopatric populations suing DNA RFLP  and direct   sequencing techniques.  The  combined expertise of the US and Chinese participants and   the resources of their herbaria  and laboratories are necessary for the successful completion   of the project.  Support on  the Chinese side will be provided by the Chinese Academy of   Sciences.",
