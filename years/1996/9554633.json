 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Association of Geology Teachers (NAGT) will develop a  program to disseminate the effective and innovative strategies for  teaching geoscience that have been developed over the last decade.   The two-year program has four components:  1) three one-day short  courses on effective teaching offered each year at meetings of  professional geoscience societies; 2) one annual four-day summer  workshop on re-designing an introductory or upper-level geoscience  course in the context of educational reform; 3) opportunities for  continuing discussions among participants via an electronic list  server and \"alumni\" reunions at meetings of professional geoscience  societies; and 4) a Teaching Resource Book of successful and  innovative strategies for teaching geoscience to undergraduates.   The audience for this project will include faculty members at a  variety of types of institutions as well as graduate students and  post-doctoral fellows.  The short courses and workshops will  introduce participants to teaching techniques that promote active  learning, stimulate them to look critically at design of effective  learning environments, and provide opportunities for discussions  about teaching.  The presenters are five experienced faculty  members who will actively involve participants in the session.   Participants will leave a short course or workshop informed not  only about the value of making changes in how they teach, but also  about specific teaching strategies and examples of assignments.",
