 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in multimedia computing technologies offer new approaches to the support of computer-assisted education and training within many application domains.  Novel interactive presentation tools can be built to enhance traditional teaching methods with more active learning. Since a variety of user interaction styles are possible, research must address the incorporation of such human interaction factors into presentation tools. Under this Research Planning Grant (RPG), the principal investigator conducts preliminary research into the impact of various quality-of-service (QoS) parameters on the various presentation tools that support interactivity functions necessary within digital libraries intended for education or training. The project explores and compares the benefits of various techniques designed to support such functions. The research activities include: (1) the identification of QoS parameters critical to the support of interactive learning and training activities; (2) preliminary experimentation with these parameters and candidate multimedia presentation methods; and (3) the construction of prototype applications to demonstrate the interactive capabilities of learning and tutoring tools.  A successful completion of these activities can lead to a more ambitious research plan to investigate interactive techniques for supporting on-line education- and training-oriented digital libraries.",
