 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600137  Xin     The PI proposes to study a class of nonlinear partial differential   equations arising from Continuum Mechanics and other branches of natural   sciences, which includes the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations for both   compressible and incompressible, inviscid and viscous fluids, the equations   of electro-magneto field dynamics for electrically conducting compressible   viscous fluids, the equations of elasticity, nonlinear Boltzmann type   equations in kinetic theory, and equations for combustion, multi-phase   flows, etc. The main goal is to gain understanding of the dynamics and   interactions of basic nonlinear waves such as shock waves, expansion waves,   solitons, diffusive waves, vortex sheets, and boundary layers, which play   important roles in the study of the general flows. In particular, it is   proposed to analyze the effects of the small scale dissipation or relaxation   processes on large scale physical quantities and their motions. Other   questions such as global existence of both strong and weak solutions,   nonlinear stability of basic wave patterns, uniqueness of weak entropy   solutions, layer behavior of solutions, numerical methods for the computation   of discontinuous flows, and fluid-dynamic limit for kinetic models are also   to be explored. It is planned to continue the current effort to expand the   existing techniques and to develop new tools for studying some of these   problems. One of the main idea is to refine the conventional methods designed   to study smooth flows or unrelaxed systems by taking into account more   internal structures of the underlying discontinuous flows, and study these   problems both theoretically and numerically.    %%%   Nonlinear evolution of partial differential equations arising from   physical balance laws govern many of the most widely encountered phenomena in   nature. Solutions to these nonlinear systems remain a central topic in the   study of wave propagations and are fundamental to the understanding of basic    physical phenomena ranging from compressible and incompressible fluids,   acoustic waves and electromagnetic scattering to wave propagations in   nonlinear composite materials, in reactive gas mixtures, in fiber optics,  as well as in magnetohydrodynamics and general relativity. In this project,   It is proposed to study some of the basic questions for these nonlinear   systems, which are motivated directly by important applications to many fields   such as image processing, aeronautics, composite material, sonar, radar,   medical imaging, geophysical exploration, weather prediction, oil reservoir   simulations etc.. For example, the proposed study of design of high resolution   multi-dimensional numerical methods for calculating sharp fronts for mixed   type partial differential equations is extremely important for the oil   reservoir simulations, design of composite materials, imaging processing,   and propagation of pollutants such as oil in water and air; the proposed   study of boundary layer theory is one of the key ingredients in the   understanding of turbulence, and the design of supersonic aircrafts, etc..   Thus the accomplishment of this project should be of considerable importance   in the improvement and new development of technologies in the above mentioned   fields.  ***",
