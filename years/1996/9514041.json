 "awd_abstract_narration": "Boake        9514041    The process of species formation is very poorly understood; a major factor is the maintenance of separate gene pools before two species are incompatible.  This proposal describes an analysis that links an intraspecific phenomenon, sexual selection, to the process of behavioral isolation and the separation of gene pools.    The proposed research will examine factors that could influence behavioral reproductive isolation between two species that are incompletely isolated.  Behavioral reproductive isolation has been explicitly related to sexual selection in two models, and the relationship deserves empirical attention.  The central hypothesis for the proposed study is that the aspects of mating behavior which are critical to species discrimination are also involved in sexual selection within at least one species.    This hypothesis will be tested by examining Drosophila silvestris and D. heteroneura, a pair of allopatric, interfertile species.  These species were chosen because they have no postzygotic isolation, their mating systems are non-resource based, and because behavioral isolation is incomplete, the cross between D. Silvestris females and D. heteroneura males is easy to make and occasionally occurs in the wild.  Behavioral isolation has arisen in the reciprocal cross, D. heteroneura females and D. silvestris males.  Furthermore, these species inspired a controversial hypothesis that relates sexual selection to speciation.  The failure of D. heteroneura females to mate with D. Silvestris males is primarily due to the failure to initiate courtship, rather than failure at later stages, and research will focus on early courtship.    At the end  of the study, behavioral traits that are keys to reproductive isolation will have been identified, which will allow an analysis of the inheritance of critical differences between the species.",
