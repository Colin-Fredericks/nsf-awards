 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625340  Sinkovich    The  objective  of this research is to determine the  nature  and behavior   of  quasiparticles  in  strongly  correlated  electron  systems,   where   band  formation  plays  an   important  role.  Conventional   difficulties  in  analysis   of   spin  polarized  photoemission  from  non-ferromagnets  will  be  circumvented  by combining  the spin analysis with  circularly polarized soft-x-ray radiation  in  the  vicinity  of the  transition  metal  2P  (L3) photoabsorption edge.  These photo emission measurements will  for the   first  time   extend  the  application  of   spin-resolved  photoemission  spectroscopy  to all  transition  metal  materials irrespective                    of    their  magnetic   state                          (ferromagnetic,  antiferromagnetic, etc.). The new techniques will be  applied  to simple  transition  metal  oxides, high-Tc  superconductors,  and narrow  band ferromagnets. The  experiments will use state-of-theart  third generation  synchrotron radiation sources in Europe and the United  States.  %%%  The  fundamental  understanding  of  magnetic  materials  remains incomplete, particularly for the class of materials  in which  the magnetic electrons interact strongly with one  another. These  are highly   correlated  electron  systems,  and  include  the   high temperature  superconductors. This  project exploits state-of-theart   synchrotron  radiation  sources  to  produce   photoemitted electrons  from magnetic  materials. An analysis of the  magnetism (spin  polarization)  of  the  photoelectrons   yields   crucial  information about the magnetic materials themselves. The  results of  the  project  will test current theories  of  the  origin  of magnetism  in highly correlated electron  systems. The information is  primarily of fundamental  interest and the results may lead to development of new  magnetic and superconducting materials.  ***",
