 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parl  95-54215    This program will demonstrate high speed Internet access for rural areas using a new low-cost and flexible Over-the-Horizon (OTH) microwave radio technology. The most remote area of Vermont, known as the North East Kingdom (NEK), has been chosen for this demonstration.  NEK schools are highly motivated to cooperate on a joint effort to implement Vermont's state education programs. However, with a few exceptions, they have ineffective means of computer communications and share a common isolation due to prohibitive long distance dialing costs. The goals of this program are: (1) to demonstrate that the technology is cost effective for interconnecting LANs and for providing remote access to the Internet and (2) to show that such cost effective connectivity in a rural area can promote a sustainable increase in collaboration between the schools and can stimulate student learning through access to the National Information Infrastructure (NII) via high quality network and Internet connections. The program consists of a one year planning and training phase, a one year operational evaluation phase, and a six month continued operational and evaluation/assessment phase.    The technology proposed builds on recent advances in low-cost OTH radio links made by Signatron and is based on the military and commercial radio modems developed in the past. Some of the new advances were made in SBIR contracts from the NSF and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The proposed radio network will complement local infrastructure grants from major computer corporations and will provide some of the infrastructure called for by current VISMT research and planning programs. Connections from school LANs to an Internet service provider are planned using fractional Tl (256 kb/s per school) with Internet access at Tl (1,544 kb/s). These rates are high enough for hundreds of users, can even provide images and video conferencing, and can be expanded with increased demand.    A cost comparison with leased line s for the 8 schools shows that the radio network investment is paid in only 20 months and that it will be 775~o less expensive to sustain than a similar network based on leased lines. Volume manufacturing can further reduce radio network costs.    The math and science education program will be planned and executed by VISMT. The results will be evaluated by WM/CRS and the Vermont Department of Education against SSI goals. UVM/CRS, aided by Americorps volunteers, will also explore extending the network to libraries, municipal offices, and local business. Upon completion, local sustainability will be assessed by WM/CRS and the nation wide applications of this technology will be independently assessed by a recognized expert in education networking.",
