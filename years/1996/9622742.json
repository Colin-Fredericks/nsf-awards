 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622742 Kazhdan   This award provides funds for the investigations of David Kazhdan and  Benedict Gross in several areas of representation theory and number  theory. Kazhdan will continue his work on the discrete series for GL(n) and on minimal representations over local fields. He is also addressing several problems posed by Drinfield on quantization, and on  generalizations of affine Lie algebras. Gross is working on a construction of motives with Galois Group G2, via an exceptional theta correspondence, and on a generalization of Serre's conjectures on Galois representations to finite groups of Lie type.   This research falls into the fields of  Algebraic  Geometry  and Number  Theory. Algebraic Geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern  mathematics, but  one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past  quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined  in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays, the  field makes use of methods not only from algebra,  but from analysis and  topology, and conversely is finding  application in those fields as well  as in physics, theoretical  computer science, and robotics. Number Theory  has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers, addressing  such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one whole number  by another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the last  half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse applications  in areas such as data transmission and processing, and communication  systems.",
