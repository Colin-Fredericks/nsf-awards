Of  particular interest are properties of incompressible surfaces in  hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and interactions between number theory and  algebra on the one hand and hyperbolic 3-manifolds on the other.    The former involves the study of the existence and construction of   incompressible surfaces in hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and the latter   concentrates on how certain invariants arising from algebraic data   associated to a hyperbolic 3-manifold are related to the geometry and   topology of the the 3-manifold.       The study of surfaces in 3-manifolds plays an important role in  3-dimensional topology.  Indeed, many of the deepest results in 3-manifold  topology have arisen from the study of how surfaces map into  3-manifolds.  Apart from their application in 3-manifold topology, the  study of surfaces in 3-manifolds has had many interesting applications  in physics.  The number theoretic connections alluded to above have  proved important in recent years in proving theorems about hyperbolic  3-manifolds.  One of the simplest number theoretic connections is  through the volume of a hyperbolic 3-manifold.  This is closely  connected to the Dilogarithm function, which appears in many guises   in other branches of mathematics and physics.  ***",
