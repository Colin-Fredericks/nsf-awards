 "awd_abstract_narration": "9531878    Rossby  As a contribution to the Atlantic Circulation and Climate Experiment (ACCE) of   the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), the Pis in this project will   seek to identify the pathways of the warm-water North Atlantic Current (NAC)   and the sites and mechanisms of frontal exchange across it using approximately   80 isopycnal RAFOS floats to be launched at various locations in the vicinity   of the NAC.  Specific objectives include: (1) exploring the structure of the   front which separates the cold, fresh subpolar water to the north and the   warm, saline subtropical water to the south, and (2) attempting to quantify   the mechanisms and rates of exchange between the two gyres.  In conjunction   with the field program of Drs. Bower and Richardson of the Woods Hole   Oceanographic Institution, they will also expand the study of the bifurcation   of the NAC as it enters the eastern North Atlantic.    The North Atlantic Current (NAC) is recognized as a crucial element of the  meridional overturning cell, both as the primary northward-penetrating  upper-ocean current and as a region where thermodynamic exchange occurs  between the subtropical and subpolar gyre.  Its character changes from an   intense, topographically controlled jet in the western boundary, to a less-  defined, perhaps filamented eastward flow after veering east north of the   Flemish Cap.  It is not clear whether the NAC is a discrete front that   translates north and south, a collection of fronts, or simply a broad swath of   eastward flow, nor is its fate fully understood.  Although most of the flow is    to the north and towards Europe, some recirculation occurs as well, and this   partitioning of pathways is important in attempting to understand and quantify   the controlling factors of the overturning cell.",
