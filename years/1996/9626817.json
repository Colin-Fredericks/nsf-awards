General  formulae for invariants of singular varieties will be developed and  will be applied, using toric varieties, to obtain precise comparisons  of lattice summation and integration.  Analytical, combinatorial and  number theoretical aspects of these comparisons will be explored with  a view to many possible applications.  Another line of investigation  will be the use of symplectic geometrical methods in the study of  representation-theoretic invariants of three-manifolds.  This will  include a series of studies of Maslov indices and analytical formulae  for Casson's SU(2) invariant as well as a study of SU(n) invariants.  A third area of investigation will be the development of a  satisfactory general theory for the topological classification of  finite group actions on manifolds; this will encompass such  foundational questions as the appropriate notion of functoriality for  this classification problem in a given homotopy type.       Non-technical summary: In this project, constructions and ideas   drawn from topology and geometry will be used to get precise formulae   that compare multidimensional integration with lattice summations.  Such   comparison formulae have been available for several centuries for  one-dimensional integrals and sums, i.e., in the Euler-MacLaurin  expansion, but have not been available in adequate generality in the  higher dimensional settings needed for many applications.  Through a  series of intermediate steps, such problems have been translated into  questions about the topology of spaces which have singularities (that  is, which are not uniform) and the measurement of how such  singularities contribute to the computation of invariants of such  spaces.  The deep methods of modern topology will be applied to  resolve these geometrical ques tions and hence ultimately to solve the  concrete problems of precise comparisons of integrals and sums.  Envisioned applications include new approaches to rapid integration  and to discrete optimization.  ***",
