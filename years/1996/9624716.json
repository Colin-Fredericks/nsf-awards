The goals of the activities are to (1) establish and maintain a  research program which produces a significant contribution to an  important and interesting area of astronomical research, (2) to  strengthen educational opportunities in astronomy at the  University of North Dakota, (3) to increase the involvement and  interest of Native Americans in astronomy research and in the  University of North Dakota, (4) to stimulate interest in  astronomy research within the University and within the state of  North Dakota.  The understanding of galaxy evolution in clusters of galaxies has  posed a persistent challenge to astronomers for approximately 20  years, beginning with discovery of the Butcher-Oemler Effect.  Photometric and spectroscopic observations of galaxies in  clusters showing this effect have confirmed this observational  enigma and increased our understanding of the problem.  The  problem stated succinctly is, \"How does the galaxy population in  clusters change from being dominated by late-type spirals at a  redshift of  z = 0.2 to being dominated by early-type galaxies in  the galaxy population at the present epoch\".  The recent  discovery that substructure is found in many clusters of galaxies  in both the optical and the X-ray region of he  electromagnetic  spectrum suggests that galaxies must experience violent mergers  of subclusters as rich clusters are formed.  Even well known rich  clusters, such as the Coma cluster of galaxies and the A2256  cluster of galaxies, are still accreting groups of galaxies so  that mergers must be an ongoing phenomenon in cluster evolution.  The study of the evolution of galaxies in clusters through the  analysis of the data from observations of  the X-ray emission  from clusters  of galaxies with  substructure will be carried  out.  Simulations of the cluster tidal effect on disk galaxies  during mergers and accretions will be developed and analyzed.  The simulations wi ll be formulated to emphasize predicting  observable quantities, such as changes in the galaxy disk due to  star formation, disk deformation, and loss of metals to the  intracluster medium.  These quantities will be compared to data  obtained at current ground-based observatories, space-based  observatories (ASCA and the Hubble Space Telescope), and future  observatories such as the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility  (AXAF).  The analysis of these data will contribute significantly  to our understanding of two important and closely linked areas:  evolution of the intracluster medium and galaxy evolution.  Educational activities to be carried out outside the classroom  will include (1) upgrading and modernizing the curricula in three  courses, which are currently severely underenrolled, when  compared to the same courses taught at other Universities, (2)  providing undergraduate and graduate students research  opportunities in astronomy, and (3) providing astrophysics  graduate students the opportunity to gain practical experience in  the laboratory working on high energy detector development.  It  is a stated future direction of the University of North Dakota to  include more computer-based, interactive learning  for students  and to strengthen ties with the Native American community in  North Dakota.",
