 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622367  Golden  We propose to develop new analytical and numerical techniques   for investigating the behavior of a number of percolation models   arising in the study of high contrast composite materials.   Some of the directions for development include:  (i) exploring the critical behavior of the random resistor network  in light of a new, direct correspondence with the Ising model,  (ii) analysis of continuum percolation models for porous media   and matrix-particle composites, (iii) developing a diagnostic   method for non-destructively telling whether one phase in a   composite percolates or not, which could have applications to   the detection of material failure or quality control for composite   manufacturing, and (iv) modeling the transport of heat and brine   through sea ice, a porous medium.  %%%  A broad range of problems in materials science involve composites   which can be characterized by a high contrast in the properties of   the components. For such media, the effective behavior is often   dominated by the connectedness, or percolation properties of a   particular phase. Examples include porous media, doped semiconductors,   smart materials such as piezoresistors and thermistors, thin metal   films (used in solar energy production), oil bearing sandstones,   fracture patterns in rocks and metals, many structures in the human   body, and sea ice (which plays a major role in climate and is an   indicator of global change). In the proposed work we will study   mathematical models of such materials. We anticipate that this project   will further our capabilities to predict the effective behavior of   naturally occurring or artificially made complex random materials,   as well as aid the development of composites designed to achieve novel  or optimal properties.   ***",
