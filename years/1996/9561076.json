 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will examine the fabrication of rotary engine parts using carbon-carbon (C-C) composite materials.  The innovative rotary engine for which these parts will be designed operates on what is known as the `true Diesel` compression ignition cycle.  Successful adaptation of these C-C components will result in this engine not only being more compact, significantly lighter in weight, quieter and more fuel efficient, but also costing less than presently available piston or Wankel type engines.  Finite element thermal and stress analysis of these parts will be done after the operating conditions of the engine have been analyzed.  Phase II would concentrate on further development with strategic partners.       Potential commercial applications for C-C composites include wear and corrosion resistant capacitors in battery and combustion components, bearings, gears, shafts, nozzles, crucibles, high temperature alloy production, high temperature tape and wire drawing dies, sensors, read-write heads in computers, brushes in electric motors, and superior thermal management devices for microelectronics.  The rotary engine has numerous applications in power, refrigeration, helicopter, and materials handling industries and is a global market due to high horsepower per unit weight.",
