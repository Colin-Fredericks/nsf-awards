 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds for establishing an Internet-  bsed interactive learning system at Indiana University-  Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI).  The Department of  Computer and Information Science (CIS) seeks to improve its  breadth-first computer science curriculum by adequately  supporting student learning of abstract theoretical  materials through interactive learning, simulation and  modeling opportunities.  The goals are 1.  to develop an  interactive learning system called PACER (Personally Active  Computing Exploration Resource) as an instructional  supplement for the breadth-first introductory computing  courses, and 2.  to cultivate and support early interest in  science through delivering PACER to K-12, college, and  returning adult students.  The PACER system meets learners\"  needs of repetition and visual simulation of complex ideas  and offers them the ability to pursue education from remote  locations and have access to resources never before  available.  The interactive design of PACER encourages self-  directed learning.  It also challenges and supports women,  minorities, commuting adults and students with disabilities  to purse the field of quantitative reasoning.    The proposed interactive learning system will be developed  as World Wide Web pages using Hypertext Markup Language.  Unlike traditional Web pages, the PACER pages will support  interactive learning sessions as well as simulations with  animation capabilities.  The hierarchical organizations of  Web pages allows the PACER system to have learning modules  that are inter linked, which in turn supports \"demand-based\"  learning.  This feature allows PACER to be an active  learning tool for learners at all levels.    The proposed PACER system will be available to students in  our breadth-first introductory compute science courses,  Computing 1 and 2, and students at New Augusta Middle School  in the Metropolitan district of Pike Township, Indianapolis,  Indiana",
