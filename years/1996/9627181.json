 "awd_abstract_narration": "9627181  Hannibal    The Cleveland Museum of Natural History will develop an exhibit  that integrates earth sciences and planetary geology.  Currently  titled \"The Hall of Earth and Planetary Exploration\" this 8700 sq.  ft. exhibit will consist of a series of ten sections, each one  focusing on a different theme including \"The Big Bang\", \"Plate  Tectonics\", \"Earthquakes and Volcanoes\", \"Ores and Mining\", and the  like.  The goals are to instill curiosity about the Earth and  planetary sciences and their interrelationships, to invite deeper  exploration into scientific information and processes, to improve  general science literacy by organizing the information into  comprehensible themes, and to present an exhibit that is relevant  to the daily lives of the general public.  Visitors leaving the  exhibit should know about the uniqueness of the earth with its  moving continents, liquid water and living beings.  They will also  have some sense of the new scientific knowledge about the universe  and the solar system and have their desire piqued to explore these  topics further.  The exhibit will have a number of complementary  components including brochures, an expanded docent program,  scheduled demonstrations and lectures by museum staff, devices for  physically disabled, teacher guides and workshops, and traveling  kits for schools.  The exhibit goals and complementary activities  align with Cleveland's Urban Systemic Initiative.  The exhibit is  scheduled to open late in 1997.",
