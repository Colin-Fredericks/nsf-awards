 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research establishes the magnitude and timing eustatic sea-  level for much of the Cenozoic by studying the subsidence of 3  thermal basins, The Baltimore Canyon Trough (offshore New Jersey),  The Northeast Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea Basin.  In each  location the eustatic component of accommodation space will be  separated from the tectonic and sediment components via a sequence  stratigraphic backstripping.  Procedure generation and study of the  North Sea Basin are funded by NSF grant EAR-9506572 to the P.I.,  Dr. Michelle Kominz.  Sequence stratigraphic data coupled with well  logs and crustal thicknesses will be the input.  Flexural  backstripping of this data produces accommodation space by removing  the effects of sediment loading.  Separation of the eustatic and  tectonic components of accommodation space will be possible based  on their unique temporal and spatial properties.  Forward modeling  of each basin is required to determine the effects of sediment on  the thermal history of the lithosphere and to determine the  flexural rigidity of the lithosphere as a function of time.   Finally, the eustatic results of each basin will be integrated to  remove regional tectonism and to obtain a Pre-Pleistocene Cenozoic  eustatic curve.     Interactive activities include: teaching upper level  undergraduate/graduate courses in Marine Geology and co-teaching a  graduate course on Sequence Stratigraphy and Backstripping.  In  addition, Dr. Kominz will present individual lectures or sets of  lectures in additional classes including Introduction to Marine  Science, Introductory Geology, Stratigraphy and Geophysics.",
