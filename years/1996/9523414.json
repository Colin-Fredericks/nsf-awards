 "awd_abstract_narration": "9523414  Raichlen  This project addresses two areas related to the damage resulting  from tsunamis, namely generation and coastal effects.  Tsunamis  are ocean waves which are generated by impulsive events such as  earthquakes, landslides, and volcanic eruptions occurring on the  ocean bottom.  The tsunami problem can be divided into three  general areas: generation, propagation and coastal effects.    This investigation is directed toward mitigation of the tsunami  hazard primarily due to nearshore underwater landslides.  In  California, numerous submarine canyons are oriented perpendicular  to the shore, with the canyon heads nearshore where the  underwater sliding of sediment layers stored in the nearshore  regions of these canyons could generate large waves.  An  important mechanism which could cause such landslides could be a  distant or an offshore earthquake, such as the Northridge  earthquake of January 1994 which caused considerable shaking  and  damage in the coastal community of Santa Monica, approximately 20  miles from the epicenter.  If such shaking had triggered the  failure of sediment layers in the nearshore canyons, it is  possible that a damaging tsunami could have been generated in the  nearshore waters.    The shape and the kinematic properties of waves generated by  underwater landslides and their modification as they propagate  shoreward and overland are important in defining the forces on  structures, such as seawalls and buildings which may be in the  path of such potentially-destructive waves.    The project involves experiments to understand the tsunami  generation mechanism through underwater sediment slides, in  conjunction with the development of an analytical model for the  generation mechanism.  It will provide data to assist in the  evaluation of inundation distances to predict coastal flooding,  and suggest reliable limits to evacuation  zones.  Such data are  important for the engineering design, urban planning, and for  improvement of the tsunami warning syste m.  The results will be  directly applicable also to engineering problems associated with  other wave-structure interactions, such as the shoreward  propagation of long-wavelength storm waves, and to waves  generated in inland reservoirs and coastal inlets by landslides.  ***",
