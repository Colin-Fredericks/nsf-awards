 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to analyze the dynamics of  innovation and technological diffusion in the world economy.  One  component of this research is to specify and to estimate a model  of productivity differences and patterns of trade, given the  allocation of technological knowledge across countries and  sectors.  The model implies that, given the distribution of  technical knowledge, trade can influence observed measures of  productivity, so that these measures reflect underlying access to  technology indirectly.  Using the model's implications for trade  flows and productivity, the parameters of the model will be  estimated with international data on these magnitudes.      The second component of the research is to specify and to  estimate a dynamic model of sectoral innovation and technology  diffusion underlying this static trade model.  Different  countries may serve as the major innovators in specific  industries, and the speed of diffusion may depend on the  technology in question and the countries involved.  The model  incorporates the decision to innovate and to patent innovations  in different countries.  This model can be used to infer the  sources of innovation and the direction of technology flow from  sectoral data on research input, productivity, and international  patenting.  Together, the two components of the research have  implications for: (i) which countries are the major innovators  and contributors to productivity growth in different sectors;  (ii) the extent to which other countries benefit from these  innovations, either through diffusion or through trade; (iii) how  innovation and technology diffusion affect observed patterns of  productivity and trade; and (iv) how barriers to trade affect  productivity and growth.",
