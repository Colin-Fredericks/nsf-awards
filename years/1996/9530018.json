 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop, organized by the Dr. Robert Naiman, of the Center for Streamside Studies, University of Washington, in collaboration with Dr. Kevin Rogers, of the Center for Water in the Environment, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa, brings together scientists from the U.S., France, UK, South Africa, and other countries in Southern Africa, from a range of disciplines, to examine the environmental factors creating and maintaining the characteristics of riparian corridors in Southern Africa.  The expected outcomes are a comparison of the state of knowledge about riparian corridors in temperate and subtropical regions, and a statement of priority research directions, especially for Southern Africa.  The workshop will include active researchers and graduate students from the biological, geological, and social sciences, as well as policy makers and resource managers.  Five South African universities are represented, including two historically-disadvantaged institutions.   The African participants come from five different countries: South Africa, Malawi, Mozambique, Botswana, and Namibia  The structure and function of riparian corridors and the human impact on these systems is an important issue for Southern Africa, where over 60 percent of the population lives within one kilometer of surface water. This workshop on this important theme can help to strengthen collaborative linkages internationally  (between US and Southern African scientists), regionally (between So. African scientists and their counterparts in neighboring countries), between historically white and historically black institutions in South Africa, across disciplinary boundaries, and, it is to be hoped, between researchers and policy makers.",
