 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pollution prevention is practiced in industry, but there  appears to be no coherent and generally applicable  principles of pollution prevention about which to organize  instructional materials. The literature abounds mainly with  anecdotal and disconnected accounts of successful pollution  prevention campaigns. There is a need for educational  material on pollution prevention. Our goal is to design a  course and prepare teaching materials suitable for students  from all engineering disciplines.  Environmental engineering texts on pollution control  summarize state-of-the art knowledge in a way that does not  foster innovation because (1) they compartmentalize the  treatment of wastewater, solid wastes, gases, hazardous  substances, etc. and (2) they typically do not deal with  pollution prevention and waste minimization. Chemical and  mechanical engineering texts on manufacturing process design  typically ignore the production of pollutants and pollution  prevention. The systematic coordinated view that is so  valuable in solving real problems is not fostered by  division along these boundaries. This approach fails to  convey to the young engineer the notion that certain  fundamentals apply to all processing systems. We seek to  amalgamate the subdivisions of process design, pollution  prevention, and pollution control, and integrate the  management of various physical forms of pollutants.  The principles of pollution prevention common to all fields  of engineering involve the intelligent management of  materials, energy, and chemical reactivity. These principles  guide the engineer in the search for superior manufacturing  processes. These rules of thumb are constrained by the  physical laws of conservation of mass, conservation of  energy, and the principles of managing chemical reactivity.  These principles serve to identify pollution prevention  concepts that might be successful from those concepts that  cannot be successful. The most important part of the  instructional material will be ch apters on applications  focusing on perhaps twenty areas of the economy. The  applications will serve to identify and limit the specific  techniques of mass ands energy balancing and the specific  rules-of-thumb to be presented in the introductory  materials.  This method of instruction emphasizes the role of the  engineer as a developer of technology that is economically  competitive and environmentally responsible. The principles  can be a generally applicable basis foe instruction in  engineering.  The final product will be a course syllabus with an  instruction manual, including practice problems and  exercises, that can be used to teach an integrated approach  to pollution prevention and control. The ultimate product  will be a textbook because this is the only way to have the  course taught nationwide.",
