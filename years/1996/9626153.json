 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626153  Puckett       This research project undertakes to develop and implement  effective numerical methods for modeling fluid flows in thermal  inkjets.  Such a flow is multidimensional and is characterized by  high thermal gradients, multiple phases, and interfaces and free  boundaries.  The project, supported under the GOALI initiative, is  a collaboration between investigators at the University of  California--Davis and Xerox and features joint mentoring of a  postdoctoral researcher.  A goal of the project is to develop  reliable and effective software to model the fluid problems and to  validate the numerical methods and software against physical  experiments.       This project is concerned with developing advanced  computational methods for modeling fluid flows in thermal inkjets,  and incorporating the methods in software.  These flows arise when  the ink in an inkjet cartridge is heated to spray characters onto  paper.  The heated ink (a liquid) forms a vapor bubble (a gas)  that shoots the ink onto the paper.  In this process, the formation  of the bubble, its growth in the surrounding ink, and the way this  forces ink out of the cartridge are genuinely three-dimensional  phenomena.  They involve thermal properties (where the ink is  heated to form a bubble), multiphase flow (liquid and gas), and  free boundaries (where the bubble grows in the ink, and where a  droplet of ink is forced out of the cartridge).  These features are  difficult by themselves.  To verify that their combination is  modeled accurately, the investigators compare the computational  results against experiments.  The project is performed by  researchers E. Gerry Puckett at UC--Davis and John Andrews at  Xerox's Wilson Research Center, who jointly mentor a postdoctoral  researcher.  This provides a close integration of research and  education in a combination of industrial and academic environments  that provides a junior mathematical scientist advanced training in  the design, development, and application of sop histicated  numerical methods to problems that arise in science and industry.  Such integration is a key feature of the GOALI initiative, which  supports the project.",
