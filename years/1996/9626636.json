 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program, focusses on the development of advanced sol-gel  materials to be used in the construction of micron dimension  analytical biosensors and biosensor arrays.  Biorecognition  molecules will be placed in these sol-gel matrices and their  selectivity and reactivity will be characterized.  The biosensor  devices that are constructed during this work will be applied to  simultaneous multicomponent analyses in complex matrices.  In  this work Professor Bright will utilize a broad range of modern  analytical techniques including scanning electron microscopy,  mercury porsimetry, optical microscopy, profilometry, and static  and time-resolved fluorescence and Raman spectroscopies.  The goal of this project is to develop small, reliable, and  inexpensive biosensors that can be used in the quantification of  clinically important analytes.  These devices will employ  biological molecules as active elements because their reactions  are selective and sensitive.  The biological molecules will be  held in sol-gel matrices where they will retain their reactivity  within the sensor.  Professor Bright will also take advantage of  the fact that sol-gel materials can be fabricated in very small  dimensions thereby enabling analyses in microscopic volumes.  The  work to be done by Professor Bright and his students could lead  to new and improved methods for doing important clinical  analyses.",
