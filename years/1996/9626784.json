 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS 9626784  Studden  This research is composed of two related parts:  one part deals  with the design of experiments and the other deals with canonical  moments in Statistics and Probability.  The research in the  design area involves the analysis of complex computer codes, the  use of rational functions in regression theory and the analysis  of rigid designs.  Complex computer codes are analysed  asympotically in order to optimally choose input values to use  for further prediction purposes.  The theory involves the use of  stochastic processes, multidimensional interpolation theory and  approximation theory. The second part involves the use of  normalized moments of distributions on the real line called  canonical moments. These have been used successfully in designing  experiments in one dimensional polynomial regression.  The  present study investigates some unanswered questions in moment  theory and random walks.  Experimental design problems in general involve how to choose  which experiments to conduct to obtain maximal information at  minimal cost.The present research involves the analysis of  complex computer codes where the problem is to decide on optimal  input values to predict the outcome at other possible input  values.  This relates significantly to high performance computing  which is one of NSF's current strategic areas.",
