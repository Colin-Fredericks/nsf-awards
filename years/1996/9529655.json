Within the context of fire   and global change research, the goals of this workshop are to:  assess   current knowledge of potential influences of global change on fire regimes;   devise a research agenda on the potential effects of global change on fire   regimes; evaluate methodologies for analyzing the influences of climate and   land-use changes on fire regimes; form a network of researcher and research   institutions interested in developing an interdisciplinary research agenda   that focuses on inter-hemispheric comparisons of fire regimes and global   change; and to develop research proposals for Phase II.  The temperate ecosystems of western North and South America are chosen for   this research program because of the comparable climates and ecosystems of   these regions.  They are broadly similar in climate and vegetation   physiognomy but differ importantly in terms of climatic history,   phylogenetic origins of the biota, and human history.  Broad similarities   in present day climate and vegetation of these two regions provide the   potential for comparative studies of the effects of climate variation and   human activities on fire regimes and the responses of these ecosystems to   altered fire regimes.  Comparative studies can effectively exploit the   important differences in settlement history, land use, and resource   technologies between temperate North and South America to disentangle the   influences of climatic variation and human activities on fire regimes.  The   specific goals of the proposed workshop are to assess and synthesize the   existing knowledge of fire and global change, to define a research agenda,   to evaluate methodologies appropriate to the study of fire history in   different ecosystems, to develop research proposal to be submitted to Phase   II , and to develop a network of researchers and institutions capable of   carrying out the research agenda on fire and global change.  %%%  This project proposes an international workshop on \"A comparison of Fire   Regimes in Terrestrial Ecosystems of Western North and South America\" to be   held in southern Chile in September of 1996.  Within the context of fire   and global change research, the goals of this workshop are to:  assess   current knowledge of potential influences of global change on fire regimes;   devise a research agenda on the potential effects of global change on fire   regimes; evaluate methodologies for analyzing the influences of climate and   land-use changes on fire regimes; form a network of researcher and research   institutions interested in developing an interdisciplinary research agenda   that focuses on inter-hemispheric comparisons of fire regimes and global   change; and to develop research proposals for Phase II.  One of the major research challenges in ecology is to identify and quantify   the ecological mechanisms and processes that control ecosystem responses to   altered climatic conditions.  Such studies are required to understand how   present landscape patterns have been influenced by climatic variation and   to predict future landscape patterns that may develop in response to   climatic change.  Fire frequency in any ecosystems is a consequence of   interactions among fuel accumulation, fuel moisture content, and ignition   sources.  Climatic variation influences fire regimes across a broad range   of temporal scales.  Analysis of fire regime responses to climatic   variation across a range of time scales is important for separating the   effects of seasonal and annual variations on fuel desiccation and ignition   from longer-term climatic influences on fuel types and loads.  Additionally, it has been recognized that understanding climatic influences   on fire regimes is critical to predicting the effects of climatic variation   on vegetation change.  The f ollowing countries are participating in this proposal:  Argentina;   Canada; Chile; and the United States.  These countries are Members Statesof   the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI), a U.S.   initiative to stimulate cooperative research on global change issues among   the scientific institutions of the Americas.  The U.S. National Science   Foundation is the U.S. Government agency designated to carry out U.S.   responsibilities within the IAI.  ***            --========================_13392216==_--",
