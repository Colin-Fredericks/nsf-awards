 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF-CONACyT Collaborative Renewal Award continues to apply  techniques from the abstract mathematical area of simplicial  algebraic topology (developed under CCR-9505949) to the  problem of coordinating concurrent processes in a  distributed or parallel computing system.  Coordination  problems arise at all scales of modern distributed and  concurrent systems, way from synchronizing access to shared  data objects in tightly-coupled multiprocessors, to  allocating data paths in ATM networks.  Coordination is  difficult because modern parallel and distributed systems  are inherently asynchronous (that is, processes may be  delayed without warning for a variety of reasons, including  interrupts, pre-emption, cache misses, communication delays,  or failures).  These delays can vary enormously in scale:  (a) a cache miss might delay  a processor for fewer than ten  instructions; (b) a page fault for a few million  instructions; and (c) operating system pre-emption for  hundreds of millions of instructions.  Coordination  protocols that do not take such delays into account run the  risk that if one processor is unexpectedly delayed, then the  remaining processes may be unable to make progress.  Such  problems become increasingly severe as systems scale.   In  the past few years, a number of researchers have developed a  range of new techniques, based on classical algebraic  topology, for analyzing distributed and concurrent protocols  and data structures.   These techniques have been applied  successfully, under the US-Mexico collaborative effort  supported by CCR-9505949, to a range of computational  problems.   This renewal collaborative project extends these  algebraic topological techniques to a range of more  difficult problems, not just for distributed and parallel  computing, but for any problem area that requires reasoning  about uncertainty and partial information.***",
