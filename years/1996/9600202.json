 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be carried out in experimental nuclear physics  and new tools will be developed for teaching nuclear physics  at the graduate level.  The central research activity is a  series of experiments designed to elucidate nuclear  structure contributions to weak interaction processes in  complex systems.  The decays of unstable nuclei are driven  principally by the weak interaction.  The proposed  measurements are very precise in nature and will address  small effects which limit our detailed understanding of the  weak interaction.  Specifically, measurements will be  carried out aimed at improving the understanding of the rare  double beta decay process, of isospin symmetry breaking and  the complexities it introduces in extracting the weak  interaction strength using weak probes or hadronic probes,  of possible effects of meson exchange currents on weak  interaction strengths, and of possible small scalar parts of  the weak interaction (which is predominantly vector/pseudo-  vector in nature).  Integration of education and research is  an equally important facet of the proposed activity.  The  experiments will be carried out at the Notre Dame tandem Van  de Graaff, and at several particle accelerators in Europe.  Graduate and undergraduate students will work on all aspects  of the proposed research to broaden their research training  and develop their research skills.  Relating explicitly to  the teaching part of this PI's overall academic activity, a  new set of problems in nuclear physics will be developed  which will provide a more contemporary basis for teaching  nuclear physics at the graduate level.",
