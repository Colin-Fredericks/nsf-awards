 "awd_abstract_narration": "Salish Kootenai College Environmental Science faculty proposes to develop an instructional methodology which infuses scientific and environmental literacy and critical thinking throughout the overall college curricula. The philosophical basis of this project is that professionals in any field must have the ability to synthesize relevant scientific and environmental information into decision-making. Environmental sciences provide the natural bridge between the sciences and non-science curricula, particularly for Native American students, because interest in the environment and natural resources is traditionally strong.  This project will include curriculum development on two levels. First is pairing of eight environmental courses with eight courses in other disciplines, including Native American studies, business management, English, math, anthropology, nursing, human services, and computer sciences. These course pairings will involve integrated student projects, parallel topics, and group discussions. Second is incorporation of environmental modules into nine other course disciplines, developed by environmental sciences and other instructors as a cooperative effort.   Results will be disseminated as a manual, on the internet, and in professional meetings.",
