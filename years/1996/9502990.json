 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the 1st-year  of a 3-year continuing award.  The objective of this research is to widen the currently narrow `information pipeline` between humans and machine learners; instead of solely providing  labeled training examples to the learner as is typically done, the algorithms  being designed also allow humans to provide broadly applicable advice  regarding the task at hand.  The human advice-giver does not have to  understand the machine learner's internal representations and algorithms, nor  does the provided advice have to be completely correct or fully explicit.  The  algorithms being developed use techniques from connectionist reinforcement  learning to (slowly) learn from the feedback provided by the learner's  environment.  The advice-giver observes the machine learner's decision making  and occasionally makes suggestions, expressed as instructions in a simple  programming language.  Based on techniques from the field of knowledge-based  neural networks, the advice is inserted directly into the agent's knowledge  base.  Importantly, the learner can subsequently refine the assimilated advice  both by neural training based on further experience and additional advice from  the human advisor.  This work promises to simplify the interaction between  humans and machine learners, and may lead to flexible, adaptive software that  tunes itself to specific users via this project's flexible advice-giving  framework.",
