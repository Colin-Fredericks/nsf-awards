 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, part of the Cross-Directorate program for   Multidisciplinary Research in Optical Science and Engineering, William   Stwalley and colleagues at the University of Connecticut will extend   optical and other physical techniques for control and manipulation of   atoms and atomic ions, such as cooling and trapping, to molecules and   molecular ions for studies of ultracold chemical reactions and inelastic   collisions.  Such ultracold collision dynamics, at temperatures near   0.001 K, are virtually unexplored, but they are predicted to show extreme   quantum behavior which is highly sensitive to details of the   interactions, including the collision energy and quantum states involved.    Ultracold molecules will be formed by photoassociation of ultracold   atoms.  Chemical reactions, such as between a cryogenic beam of molecular   hydrogen and laser-cooled cesium atoms, will be explored in both the cold   and ultracold regimes, that is, at temperatures less than 10 K and 1 mK,   respectively.    The techniques of laser manipulation, which have proven so fruitful with   atoms, will be extended to allow investigations involving molecules and   molecular ions.  Novel chemical processes and physical behavior are   expected to be found in the ultracold temperature region examined in this   program.  This interdisciplinary research will have significant   educational impact at several levels.",
