The PI is one of  the very few people who approach the problem of strongly  correlated fermions with a strong background in state of the  art ab-initio electronic band structure and also in the many  body techniques.  The current grant is to study unusual  magnetism and crystal field effects of a series of  monopnictides and monochalcogenides of Cerium and Uranium.  These compounds are isostructural and have been selected for  a controlled study of the correlated f-electrons,  incorporating the three essential subtleties of magnetism  all in one series:  Crystal Field effects, Kondo Effect and  exchange interaction.  %%%  Exotic magnetism is often found in the rare earth materials  and their compounds.  In this grant the objective is to  study  the magnetic properties of (1:1) compounds of Cerium  and Uranium, each with two columns in the periodic table:  group Vb, consisting of  (N, P, As, Sb and Bi) and the  chalcogens of  group VIb consisting of (O, S, Se, Te) using  state of the art techniques.  ***",
