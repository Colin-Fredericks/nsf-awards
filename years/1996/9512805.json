The  first is a local pilot program to be carried out at City  University of New York.  This program consists of 3 parts: 1) a  number of supplemental mini-courses to the traditional Ph.D.  program in the areas of communication skills, computational  skills and the business aspects of high technology; 2) a regular  seminar series on traditional and non-traditional careers; and,  3) workshops on job and career seeking skills for graduate  students in the Ph.D. program.  The proposed program at CUNY will  be developed with the input and cooperation of the department  chairs, senior faculty and graduate students.  The second project  is a national program involving direct interaction with the  faculty and students at universities in various regions of the  nation.  This project will nurture local programs to improve and  widen career opportunities for Ph.D. physicists.  This second  project involves working with the faculty and students to  identify and develop a series of actions and programs and courses  which will maximize and focus the use of local resources.  A  career seminar series and strategies for supplementing and  enlarging the scope of courses for Ph.D. physics students will  also be encouraged.  ***",
