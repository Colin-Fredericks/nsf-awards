In the realist view, \"the historically most important manifestation of the balance of power . . . is to be found . . .in the relations between one nation or alliance and another alliance.\" (Morgentahu, 1949)  Two lines of research have been developed:  the first emphasizes inter-allkiance competition, studying conditions under which an alliance system is stable, assuming that alliances are unitary actors and that cvollective action problems among allies do not arise; the second focuses on intr-alliance collective action problems, assuming that external threats do not exist or can be kept constant.  The study of inter-alliance competiion is not complete without the consideration of intra-alliance collective action problems, and the study of collective action problems within an alliance must also consider the severity of external threats.    The purpose of this project is to study alliance politics by developing a game theoretic framework that incorporates both inter-alliance competition and intra-alliance competition in the context of international relations.  This extension involves finding the core in which no alternative grouping of allies can do better.  Specifically, the researchers are interested in the following questions:  Are large countries exploited by small countries in both strong and weak alliances?  When the number of allies increases, does the level of provision of public goods within the alliance decrease?  If countries may choose which alliances to join, does a stable coalition structure exist?  Are countries more likely to balance or bandwagon?  Can grand coalitions ever be stable?    This study  will provide an opportunity to understand alliance politics from a different vantage point.  For example, the initial exploration of this period by the investigator several years ago sometimes helps him question the truthfulness of conventional wisdom.  An in-depth study of this period will allow the inv estigators to conduct a comparative study of the Chinese and European alliance.  ***",
