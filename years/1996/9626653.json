Executive Summary             In August of 1996, the IEEE Education Society will publish a special issue of its Transactions,  accompanied by a CD-ROM, tided \"Applications of Information Technologies to Engineering and  Science Education\" to demonstrate how WWW/CD ROM technology can be used by engineering and  science societies to review, disseminate, and most importandy, archive software and multi-media  material. Although the CD-ROM may contain electronic versions of the printed contributions, its main  role is to permit distribution and archiving of special material related to the printed articles, such as  software, color graphics, video files, sound files and postscript files. There is no doubt that such  material will become an integral part of all future publications. The EEE Vice President for Publications  has already approved placing the special issue on a widely publicized, carefully monitored WWW server  for four months starting two months before publication to assess the success of dhe use of information  technology in publishing archival journals             To maxirnize the usefulness and impact of dhe special issue, cross-platform compatibility will be  achieved by treating the CD-ROM as a World Wide Web (WWW) server so dhat WWW browsers (such  as Mosaic, Netscape and others) running on Microsoft Windows machines, Macintoshes or X-Windows  machines can view the files on dhe same CD-ROM. This approach to cross-platform compatibility  exploits the cross-platform de facto standard that has been generated by dhe recent explosive use of the  WWW.             Although the Ii4.141< Education Society is leading dhe effort, dle EEE Computer Society, the  American Society of Mechanical Engineers, and other societies and entities are being invited to join the  effort as co-sponsors. Co-sponsors will i nsure dhe multidisciplinary scope of the effort will guarantee  that the special issue experiment receives widespread visibility and distribution, and answers many of the  questions now being posed about dhe benefits of using inforamtion technology in this way. However,  since there are added costs for the production of the issue, financial support from the co-sponsors and the  NATIONAL SCENCE FOUNDATION is needed. The projected need for financial support from the  Foundation is $10,000.00.",
