 "awd_abstract_narration": "9616738  Roberts  Articular cartilage lesions often heal slowly and incompletely  due to the poor ability of this tissue to proliferate following  injury.  Controlled upregulation of chondrocyte metabolism and  matrix synthesis may potentially enhance the healing outcome.  Single Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm) treatments of in vitro bovine and  canine articular cartilage explants have been reported to produce  significant increases in the matrix content of glycosaminoglycans  (GAG), proteoglycans (PG), collagen, and noncollagen protein 3-7  days post-irradiation.  Use of the 1064 nm wavelength for this  purpose is non-ideal, however, due to the low photon energy and  poor absorption characteristics of this wavelength in articular  cartilage.  Furthermore, the YAG laser is expensive, non-  portable, and requires complicated water cooling during  operation.         The purpose of this proposal is to determine if equine articular  cartilage matrix synthesis can be nonthermally modulated in vitro  via irradiation with a helium neon (HeNe, 633 nm) laser, a diode  laser (810 nm), or a broadband light source.  It is hypothesized  that 633 and 810 nm laser irradiation will be successful in  modulating cartilage metabolism due to the higher photon energy,  more favorable absorption characteristics, and reported success  in other low energy laser applications using these wavelengths.         In Phase 1 of this proposal, PG synthesis will be assayed in  cartilage explants following irradiation under a variety of light  delivery protocols in order to determine the effective range of  parameters necessary to consistently upregulate PG matrix  synthesis with these light sources.  In Phase 2, irradiation-  induced temperature increases in cartilage explants as a function  of energy delivery protocol, depth in the explant, and light  source will be recorded.  Data from Phases 1 and 2 will be used  to select appropriate light delivery protocols for Phase 3  experiments and verify the nonthermal nature of the light  inte raction with the tissue.  In Phase 3, cultured equine  articular cartilage explants will be irradiated with one of the  three light sources using energy delivery protocols found to be  effective in Phase 1.  Light-induced changes in matrix PG, GAG,  total protein, and cell viability will be compared to non-  irradiated control explants.         It is anticipated that this interdisciplinary project will  develop the preliminary data required for a full NSF funding  proposal.  Future work will extend this investigation into in  vitro human tissue or in vivo animal experiments and investigate  the mechanism of action of light in articular cartilage.  Ultimately, clinical treatments may be possible in which an  appropriate dose of light is delivered to cartilage lesions  through arthroscopy or used to enhance cell growth in culture for  autologous chondrocyte implantation.  ***",
