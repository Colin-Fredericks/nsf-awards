The focus  of this investigation is on the ecology of benthic microalgae in  an estuarine ecosystem.     The research will investigate the relationship between microalgal  and phytoplankton biomass and production in the Manukau Harbor.  This estuarine ecosystem receives treated sewage effluent from  Auckland, creating a strong gradient of nutrient loading and  turbidity.  The study will test the hypothesis that light  attenuation by phytoplankton, and its derived detritus, drives an  inverse relationship between the algal and plankton biomass.  The  study brings together the expertise of the New Zealand  investigator in light attenuation in aquatic ecosystems and the  American researcher in the measurement of benthic microalgal  biomass and production.  ***",
