Its operating premise is that a more robust  technology transfer relationship between EPSCoR state universities  and industrial partners will have positive impacts on the  fundamental research and educational activities of the  institutions.  The project will conduct an outreach effort focused  on EPSCoR-state universities that has the following components:   (1) an annual report to the region (e.g., the Southern Governors  Association) on the state of university-industry technology  transfer; (2) an annual practitioner/stakeholder conference; (3) a  network of \"best practitioners\" who can provide outreach assistance  to peers in EPSCoR-state universities; (4) a continuing analysis of  performance and practice benchmarks; (5) accelerated dissemination  of relevant reports, guidebooks, and tools; and (6) continued  professional development services for faculty.",
