 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years geometric modeling and simulation techniques  have become essential tools for applications involving  physical objects.  Although much progress has been made,  there are important applications that cannot be realized  with current technology. Examples include controlling  autonomous robots operating in dynamic situations, training  an employee for a dangerous task in a virtual reality  environment, and helping an engineer interactively analyze  design choices using a threedimensional model of a complex  product.  The general objective of this research is to  design and implement practical algorithms for such  applications.  Toward this goal, the applicability of  techniques developed in the field of computational geometry  to the following target applications will be studied:  performing robotic path planning and planning manipulation  tasks with contact, and analyzing product designs for  manufacturability, assembly, and disassembly. The research  will be performed in collaboration with an ongoing research  effort at Texas A&M in dextrous manipulation and with  researchers at GE R&D analyzing product designs for and  maintainability.  Two educational activities will be undertaken.  First,  mentoring and general support programs will be initiated for  undergraduate and graduate women in the Computer Science  Department at Texas A&M. The goal of these programs is to  encourage more women to pursue graduate studies and careers  in computer science and engineering. Second, group learning  methods will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate  courses in theoretical computer science.  The change from  the standard lecture format is motivated by research that  has shown that group learning can increase student interest  and help them to understand concepts more fully.  ***",
