 "awd_abstract_narration": "9602119  Jackson    Circadian clocks located in the brains of all animal species  are essential for the regulation of daily rhythms in many  different physiological, endocrine, and behavioral  processes.  Such clocks, for example regulate the timed  release of hormones, the timing of waking and sleeping, and  even the changing sensitivity of animals and humans to  pharmacological agents used in the treatment of cancer and  other diseases.  Circadian clocks can be reset by light  stimuli and this is crucial for the synchronization of these  clocks to environmental light/dark cycles.  The proper  synchronization of circadian clocks to environmental time  (solar time) is essential and insures that physiological  processes (within an organism's body) occur at an  appropriate time of day and in a coordinated manner.  Indeed, most travelers are aware of the phenomenon of jet-  lag, which results from a desynchronization of bodily  rhythms during adaptation to a new time zone.  Although it  is known that light can reset the circadian clock, the exact  mechanism by which the nerve cells comprising the clock  transduce light information into a resetting response is not  well understood.  The major purpose of this grant is to  define and study the signaling pathways within clock neurons  which are activated during the clock resetting response.  This work will be accomplished using the model genetic  system Drosophila melanogaster and contemporary molecular  biological approaches.  It will also take advantage of  existing Drosophila mutants which have heritable lesions  affecting specific cellular signaling pathways.  The  significance of this work is that it will lead to a more  complete understanding of how the brain's clock is reset by  environmental signals such as light.",
