 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program will support Charles S.   Parmenter of Indiana University in Bloomington to continue his studies of   state-resolved energy transfer in various molecules.  The gist of his   experiment is to use a supersonic molecular beam technique to generate   molecules in a few, very specific rotational states.  Laser pumping is   then used to excite the molecule to the first singlet electronic excited   state, and dispersed fluorescence detection of states populated by   inelastic scattering yields relative cross sections for single collision   energy transfer channels.   Past efforts involved scattering of glyoxal   (12 vibrational modes) from rare gases or diatomic molecules.  During   this funding period, the investigator will extend his studies on glyoxal   to collisions with helium or diatomic hydrogen.  He will also study   relative cross sections as a function of center-of-mass energy between   collision partners.   Finally, the crossed beam experiments will be   extended to deuterated formaldehyde, a molecular system far different   from glyoxal due to its nonplanar excited electronic state, presence of a   dipole moment and extreme anharmonicity in an active vibrational mode.    The research is directed at the problem of vibrational and rotational   energy flow within polyatomic molecules.  This is central to the problem   of how molecules acquire the activation energy needed for reactions.  The   collision-free vibrational energy flow is a fundamental aspect of   dissociation or isomerization of molecules with high vibrational   excitation.",
