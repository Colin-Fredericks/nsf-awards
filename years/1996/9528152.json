 "awd_abstract_narration": "9528152  PERLIN     For purposes of wildlife conservation it is important to be able to identify individual animals to be used in captive breeding programs and to assess populations of endangered species. Several methods have been developed to produce molecular \"fingerprints\" for such analyses. With the rapid decrease of biodiversity, quick and effective methods of assaying biological molecules (such as DNA) are important.   Dr. Perlin has developed a simple technique called DNA thermal profiling. The technique employs analysis of how an organism's DNA melts.  Initial evidence indicates that each individual or species may have a unique melting profile. This technique circumvents the more tedious and costly methods currently in use in many labs. The new method is also technically simpler and data can be generated in less time.  Furthermore, the amount of DNA required is small (100-200 ng) and total genomic  DNA is used as opposed to small, selected portions. Thus, it has the advantage of detecting and utilizing microheterogeneities throughout the test organisms' genomes. It may thus produce a true DNA \"fingerprint\" of the organism.    Dr. Perlin has applied DNA thermal profiling to the study of redwing blackbirds, Cuban crocodiles, and alligators.  He proposes to determine the genetic basis of the technique and thereby further strengthen its validity. The data obtained from animals with well-established pedigrees (e.g., racehorses and beagles) will be examined for Mendelian patterns of inheritance. In addition, populations of endangered animals maintained in zoos or breeding facilities will be studied to determine whether this technique can be used effectively for such population analyses. As much as possible, all data obtained with DNA thermal profiling will be compared with that obtained by already-established methods for DNA fingerprinting and population studies.  Dr. Perlin is primarily interested in studying the limits of this new and potentially exciting method in environmental biology. If  the method is robust, the results of this study could demonstrate that DNA thermal profiling is a quick and simple method for DNA fingerprinting with particular significance for conservation biologists and captive breeding programs.",
