 "awd_abstract_narration": "A model is being developed for the introduction of technology into chemistry laboratories in small, rural institutions of higher education. To accomplish this goal, ten state-of-the-art computers are being networked together in the chemistry laboratory. These computers are being interfaced with balances and spectrophotometers, and with pH/ion meters already owned by the department. All of the computers are equipped with CD-ROM drives for use as data sources, and the network includes three printers. Students use spreadsheet programs for recording and management of laboratory data. They use Maple V algebra instructional software for working problems in class, and the program is available to students and mathematics classes when chemistry classes are not using the laboratory. This exposure to Maple also prepares students for more sophisticated use of the program at the university level. A molecular modeling program is installed on the system, making it possible to add new experiments in both General Chemistry I and General Chemistry II. Students are becoming comfortable with the use of computers as scientific and data analysis/management tools while they experience new and exciting ways to conduct chemistry experiments. This cross-curricular, applied learning approach benefits mathematics students as well as those enrolled in chemistry classes. Oral presentations at ACS regional and national meetings will disseminate results of the proposal's implementation, and an article will be submitted to the Journal of Chemical Education.",
