 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:     Professor William A. Goddard at the Beckman Institute of the  California Institute of Technology is supported by a grant from the   Theoretical  and Computational Chemistry Program to perform research involving theory   and  simulation on problems relevant to new catalysts and chemical processes.    The  goal of the research is to determine a set of general concepts and   principles  that will form the basis of mechanistic understandings.  These   understandings  would make it possible to predict some of the properties of new systems   without  measurements or calculations.  The strategy to achieve this goal is to   make use  of ab initio quantum mechanical, QM, results combined with molecular   dynamics,  MD, studies of reaction kinetics.  The need to perform these QM and MD  calculations on realistic models of systems of practical industrial   interest is  given high priority.  The work is divided into method development and the  application of QM and MD to specific catalytic problems of industrial  importance.  This research is supported  under the NSF  Grant Opportunities for Academic Liason with Industry (GOALI) initiative.     There is enormous opportunity for theory and simulation to aid in  designing, developing, and engineering the catalysts and chemical   processes  important to industry and society.   With reliable simulations to reduce   the  number of experiments, U.S. industry could save many millions of dollars   per  year and could cut years off development cycles by focusing on the most  promising catalysts and processes.   To help provide the scientific basis   for  designing, characterizing, and optimizing new catalysts, the supported   research  involves a broad attack on the mechanisms of several industrially   significant  catalytic processes.   This theoretical work involves the use of both   ab initio quantum theory and molecular dynamics simulations. These   studies will demand size and time scales which stretch current   methodologies and, hence, considerable emphasis is placed on developing   new methods.",
