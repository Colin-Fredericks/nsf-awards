 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many elementary school teachers do not feel comfortable  teaching physical science using inquiry-based methods and do  not have the required background to present science as  agender-neutral activity that relates to the every-day lives  of both male and female students.  This is primarily a  result of their university training. The work proposed here  would result in a revised introductory physics curriculum  for pre-service teachers, particularly those at institutions  employing the quarter system. The curriculum is to be  developed as a series of hands-on activities and  exploration/research projects, and will include historical  and current biographical material on scientists of both  sexes and a variety of racial backgrounds. The activities  will focus on areas, such as health and the environment,  that have been shown to be of concern to students,  particularly female students. Effectiveness of the  curriculum for both male and female students will be tested  in the classroom and results will be disseminated in the  literature and through electronic media. A final version of  the curriculum will be made available for general adoption  through a publisher.",
