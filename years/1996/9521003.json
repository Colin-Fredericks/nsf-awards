 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program, is  directed towards the renewed study of solvation and retention  mechanisms in reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). During  the tenure of this eighteen month standard grant, Professor Carr  and his students at the University of Minnesota will expand their  research in solvatochromism towards the characterization of  separation processes in supercritical fluid and micellar systems.  Gas chromatographic stationary phases will be designed with  functional groups that participate in hydrogen bonding, acid base,  and dipolar interactions with various polar and nonpolar test  solutes. These interactions will be quantified using headspace gas  chromatography in conjunction with linear solvation energy  relations and Kamlet-Taft solvation parameters. This approach will  be applied to the understanding and prediction of analyte retention  in supercritical fluid chromatography and micellar electrokinetic  capillary chromatography.  Unlike magnetic and optical spectroscopic techniques which allow  the calculation and correlation of spectral energy parameters with  analyte structure, the prediction of retention profiles in reversed  phase chromatography is complicated by lack of a definitive theory  which can correlate molecular interactions between species in  solution with the partitioning of analyte between mobile and  stationary phases. Professor Carr and his students at the  University of Minnesota have been leaders in development of the  solvatochromic theory, which in concert with empirical  chromatographic and spectroscopic measurements, attempts to  quantify retention behavior in separation science. These pursuits  will be expanded to the characterization of new forms of  chromatography targeted towards environmental and industrial  applications.",
