 "awd_abstract_narration": "Harris    The investigator will study the geometry of plane curves, and specifically the Severi varieties papametrizing plane curves having given degree and genus and satisfying additional geometric conditions. This will proceed in three directions. First, the investigator will extend existing work on irreducibility and degree of Severi varieties to varieties parametrizing plane curves with singularities other than nodes. Second, he will apply recently developed techniques to describe certain hyperplane sections of these varieties, with possible applications to questions (such as the Enriques conjecture) concerning the Picard groups of these varieties and of the universal curves over them. Finally, the investigator will attempt to use the same ideas to analyze a related question, that of the dimension of the linear series of plane curves with singularities at assigned general points.    This is research in the field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry deals with very basic objects, figures that can be defined in the plane and in space by the simplest equations, namely polynomialsis. It is thus one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics--it was studied, for example by the ancient Greeks. At the same time it is one of the newest, having had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. Within algebraic geometry, perhaps the most basic and most thoroughly studied subject is that of algebraic curves, that is, curves in the plane defined by a single polynomial equation in two variables. For all the work that has been done on these objects classically, however, our understanding of them is still developing, and at a rapid pace; it is a very active field of investigation.",
