 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS 9625476  McCulloch    The generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) generalizes the standard linear  model in three ways:  accommodation of non-normally distributed responses,  specification of a possibly nonlinear link between the mean of a response  and the predictors, and allowance for some forms of correlation in the data.  Unfortunately, standard techniques like maximum likelihood estimation are  computationally difficult for GLMMs and hence a number of alternate  approaches have been proposed.  This research will develop two approaches to  inference for GLMMs:  1) computationally-intensive simulation-based methods  for maximum likelihood estimation, and 2) methods based on  \"joint-maximization\" ideas.  The joint maximization methods will be viewed  as a set of generalized estimating equations for the purpose of theoretical  evaluation and improvement.  The new approaches will be evaluated and  compared to extant methods.      Generalized linear mixed models are an important and broadly applicable set  of statistical models for the analysis of data.  For example, they can be  used to model repeated counts of animals through time at fixed sampling  locations for the purpose of environmental assessment.  They are applicable  to data which are gathered in a wide variety of formats and are capable of  modelling data exhibiting associations.  Association in the above example  would arise because repeated data values at a single location would be  similar.  Failure to incorporate such associations can lead to incorrect  conclusions from the analysis of data.  Unfortunately, the use of  generalized linear mixed models has been limited due to computational  difficulties and the lack of availability of well-tested parameter  estimation methods which have known performance characteristics.  This  research will develop two approaches to the analysis of such data and  evaluate their performance, both in absolute terms and in relation to extant  methods.",
