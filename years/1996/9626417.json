 "awd_abstract_narration": "Allen  9626417       The goals of this research involve two different but related  biological areas; one area is weed control and the other is  control of infectious diseases.  By their very nature, weeds and  infectious disease agents are unwanted invaders in a host system;  their introduction frequently has adverse effects.  Practical  methods for control of weeds and infectious diseases are under  continual research and development.  However, there is a need for  theoretical justification and predictability of these control  procedures.  This project develops and analyzes mathematical  models that provide quantitive and qualitative means for  evaluation of these control procedures.  Integrodifference  equations provide a realistic starting point for modeling the  biological dynamics of these two processes; the time variable is  discrete but the spatial and state variables are continuous.  Discrete-time models describe plant populations whose generations  are nonoverlapping and epidemics where the observation of cases  or the seasonal movement and population densities of animals  relate to the discrete time interval.  Mathematical models for  weeds and infectious diseases are analyzed to determine the  effects of spatial dispersal, age or stage structure,  multi-population interactions, and general growth assumptions on  model behavior.  Two important questions are addressed: (i) How  fast does the weed or disease spread? and, (ii) What are the  short- and long-term effects of a control procedure?       Determining effective control procedures for weeds and  infectious diseases has become a significant global environmental  problem.  Around the world, native plant communities are being  displaced by nonnative plants and enzootic wildlife diseases are  becoming a threat to humans.  In particular, agricultural land and  rangeland, where the native plant community structure has been  altered, are especially vulnerable to invasions by introduced  plant species.  Humans living in close proximity to  an animal  reservoir of a disease are at an increased risk of contracting  the disease.  It is the goal of this research to apply the  mathematical models and theoretical techniques that are developed  in this project to two important and timely biological problems:  (1) control of weeds in agricultural fields or rangeland and (2)  control of rabies in wildlife populations.  Formulation, analysis,  and numerical simulation of mathematical models provide a greater  understanding of effective methods for the control of the spread  of weeds in fields or rangeland and of rabies in wildlife.  Various control strategies are compared to determine the most  effective short- and long-term strategies that prevent or reduce  the spread while causing minimal damage or change to the  environment and minimal risk to humans.",
