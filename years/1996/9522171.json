 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522171  Gulliver    The objective of this project is to conduct experimental  investigation of the dissolution and droplet formation processes  in riverine environments as a step toward formulation of better  mathematical models than are currently available for use in  prediction of the transport and fate of slightly water-soluble  pollutants of surface waters.  The experiments will be performed  in a moving-bed flume that was specifically designed for conduct  of interfacial transfer experiments.  The flume simulates  conditions in flowing streams that affect dissolution, rate of  droplet formation and the equilibrium concentration of the target  pollutant in the polluted water.    Spills of slightly soluble liquids on surface waters result in  the formation of surface slicks that move in the direction the  water is flowing while dissolving, evaporating and forming  droplets in the flowing water.  Environmental issues associated  with spills of these liquids relate to the transport properties  of the spilled liquid and the characteristics of the bed over  which the liquid flows.  Results of this research are expected to  improve the engineering design of mitigation measures that can be  applied to reduce the pollutional impact of these pollutants on  the quality of surface water supplies in preparation for their  intended use.",
