Some of the most ambitious projects in the history of scientific research are now being undertaken at high luminosity particle accelerator facilities at various sites around the globe.  Central to the success of these endeavors are the availability of detectors such as those proposed.   Presently the only technology capable of achieving the required optical performance is a system of detectors which require extremely cumbersome and expensive cryogenic cooling to liquid helium temperatures.  As a result of the Phase I research, a new technology has been invented which should greatly reduce the expense and challenge of detecting the faint optical signals central to such scientific quests.  This technology consists of arrays of unique, super high gain avalanche photodiodes with such low noise that they can operate at temperatures near -50 degrees C, a temperature range which can be economically reached with little difficulty.  In Phase II, research will be conducted to move this device, whose performance has been characterized and found to exceed initial expectations, to the point where it will be ready for immediate incorporation at many high energy facilities.       These new optical sensors are so sensitive that they will be useful for a wide array of optical applications including large high energy physics systems, satellite aiming and communication and fiber optic data systems.  ***",
