 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Rutgers Consortium for Educational Equity, an affiliate of the  Rutgers Center for Mathematics, Science and Computer Education  (CMSCE) and the designated New Jersey Family Math and Family  Science training site, has developed Family Tools & Technology  (FT2), an after-school program targeting girls and their parents.  They collaborate in problem-solving activities (using tools and  building models) that illustrate the importance of science,  engineering and mathematics in the world beyond the classroom.   This project supports the development and assessment of a cost-  effective, pedagogically sound, replicable training model,  including a leadership component that will be piloted in NJ prior  to national dissemination.  The effort was inspired by Project  2061, Science for All Americans, The AAUW Report:  How Schools  Shortchange Girls, the NCTM Standards, and the USDOE's Goals 200.   FT2 was created:  to increase the number of girls who are excited  about science and technology; to encourage their continuing  interest; to stimulate parents to become advocates for their  daughters' endeavors in science and technology; and to train  teachers to promote girls' continued participation and confidence  in a critical period in their educational development (pre-  adolescence).    The first phase of this project (1995-96), focused on a year-long  assessment funded by NSF to evaluate the effectiveness of the 14  FT2 activities and accompanying materials and strategies.  It  looked at the program's impact on reducing the gender gap in terms  of girls' experiences and aspirations in 12 elementary schools with  approximately 240 families, 70% of which had participating  daughters.  It included an 11-day training model in which teachers  were trained in FT2 techniques, to equip them to present and  facilitate these activities in two series of six after school  sessions for girls and their families.  Based on the positive  results of the field-testing and assessment, the second phase of  the project  will be refined and streamlined into a cost-effective,  pedagogically sound, five-day training that can be easily  disseminated and replicated.  A leadership component will prepare  experienced FT2 teachers to train others to conduct the program.   This revised model will be piloted and assessed, as well as  institutionalized, in selected NJ schools during 1996-97 in  preparation for national dissemination.",
