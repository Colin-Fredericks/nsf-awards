 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purchase of commercially-built electron paramagnetic  resonance (EPR) instrumentation is proposed which will advance  the ASU Photosynthesis Center's EPR laboratory to the state of  the art in several areas. The majority of the budget is allocated  to the purchase of a pulsed Fourier Transform (FT)-EPR accessory,  the Bruker ESP 380E, for the Center's existing continuous-wave  (CW) EPR spectrometer, a Bruker ESP 300E. The 380E offers  improved sensitivity, time resolution, reliability, ease of use,  and (most importantly) versatility over the home-built pulsed  spectrometer currently used by the Center's investigators. For  example, 380E can perform two-dimensional electron spin echo  envelope modulation (ESEEM) experiments, execute complex  phase-cycling routines automatically, and implement long or novel  pulse sequences without modification of microwave or pulse timing  hardware. The Center's present pulsed instrument has none of  these capabilities. In addition, attachments for the 300E and  380E will be purchased that will provide the Center's  investigators, for the first time, with the following  spectroscopic tools: pulsed electron-nuclear double resonance  (pulsed ENDOR); 35 GHz EPR measurements from 3.8 K to room  temperature; and 35 GHz ENDOR. The proposed upgrade of the  Center's Bruker 300E CW spectrometer will also include  construction (by the PI) of a high-Q quartz 9 GHz ENDOR cavity of  the type described by Lubitz.    The uses of this instrumentation will lie mainly in the area of  photosynthesis and plant science, but will also include basic  studies of protein structure and enzyme mechanisms which have  applications across the life sciences. For example, pulsed and CW  ENDOR and fast time-resolved EPR measurements will aid in  characterization of Photosystem II mutants in which the  properties of the tyrosine D or Z radicals have been affected. In  studies of chloroplast Fl-ATPase using oxovanadium (VO2+) and  Mn2+ as paramagnetic probes, the availability of the new  in struments will permit precise determination of local ligand  structure. In addition, extensive spectroscopic characterization  of metal-ligand model systems whose crystal structures have been  determined will help to establish the 'signature' hyperfine  couplings from commonly-occurring protein-based metal ligands.  Determination of structural changes during the ATPase's catalytic  cycle will lead to full mapping of its highly complex catalytic  mechanism. Other systems to be examined using the new  instrumentation are: Photosystem I; the Fenna-Matthews-Olson  protein in photosynthetic green sulfur bacteria; lysine  2,3-aminomutase and ethanolamine-ammonia lyase (both of whose  reactions proceed through free radical intermediates); and the  enzyme S-adenosylmethionine synthetase, which produces the  primary intracellular methylating agent in a wide variety of  organisms. Finally, FT-EPR measurements on short-lived  charge-separated states in artificial photosynthetic systems will  be undertaken, as a probe of the complex problem of the influence  of structure upon electron transfer processes. In all cases, the  proposed instrumentation will yield, to a degree not heretofore  possible, atomic-scale structural information from disordered  samples.    Funding of the proposed equipment purchases/construction will  enhance significantly the research training for graduate students  as well as summer research experiences for undergraduates. The  improvement in ease of use of the pulsed instrument will make it  far more practical to introduce students to the intricacies of  pulsed techniques, within the context of a formal course or as a  part of individual laboratory training. This-project will also  allow the Center's EPR facility to maintain its high-profile  external collaborations with investigators from leading  institutions nationwide, and to attract other such  collaborations.          )    A - I",
