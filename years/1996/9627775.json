 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program is supporting Prof.   Keiji Morokuma at Emory University in his theoretical research on   transition metals and their complexes. High level ab initio theoretical   calculations are applied to a wide range of problems on structure and   reactions of transition metal atoms, ions, complexes and clusters. The   potential energy surfaces of a variety of chemical reactions will be   calculated, ranging from gas phase reactions of bare transition metal   ions and atoms and simple complexes, activation of various bonds by   complicated transition metal complexes, the potential energy profiles of   full catalytic cycles by organometallic catalysts, and reactions of   transition metal clusters and cluster complexes. In addition to the   standard ab initio molecular orbital (MO) methods, the Integrated   Molecular Orbital + Molecular Mechanics (IMOMM) method and the integrated   MO + MO (IMOMO) method, developed recently by the principle investigator,   will be used for studies of reactions involving complicated ligands.   Theoretical studies of full catalytic cycles by transition metal   complexes, which still remain a challenge to theoreticians, will be   performed for (1) boration of alkenes and alkynes by Pt(0) and Pd(0)   complexes, (2) regio- and enantio-selective  hydroformylation of olefins by Rh(I) catalyst with a chiral ligand   BINAPHOS, and (3) Murai's C-H activation of aromatic ketones by Ru   complexes. In addition copolymerization of olefin and CO catalyzed by   Pd(II) complex and dehydrogenative polymerization of silanes by   zirconocene catalysts will be studied. In the boration of alkenes and   alkynes, Pd(0) and Pt(0) have very different reactivities to different   B-X bonds, and the origin of the difference will be studied. In   enantioselective hydroformylation, the different selectivity with   different phosphine ligands will be studied with the IMOMM method to   provide a clue for design of better ligands.  The knowledge to be obtained through this research, such as structure,  spectroscopic properties and energies of reaction intermediates and   transition  states, is complementary to that gained from experiments, and is expected   not only to promote the fundamental understanding of complicated chemical   reactions of transition metal complexes but also to help logical design   of new catalysts for better control of complicated chemical reactions.   Close contact with experimental groups will be maintained throughout the   proposed research.",
