The following topics are studied: (1)  computation and bifurcations of invariant tori, (2) computation  of Lyapunov exponents and applications, (3) orthogonal  factorizations for time-dependent matrices and applications, (4)  Riccati equations, (5) logarithms of matrices and matrix  interpolation.  In each case the project combines theoretical  analysis and extensive computational testing, and develops  working codes.  Several aspects of this research are being carried  out in collaboration with Timo Eirola, Jens Lorenz, Erik Van  Vleck, Alessandra Papini, Aldo Pasquali, and Ph.D. students  Michael Keeve and Benedetta Morini.  The investigator analyzes and  implements algorithms to compute invariant tori of  parameter-dependent dynamical systems and to study their  bifurcations.  He studies ways to monitor Lyapunov type numbers on  the tori in order to detect their smoothness and understand and  classify their bifurcations and breakdown mechanisms.  The whole  issue of computation of Lyapunov type numbers (or Lyapunov  exponents) is also considered.  Quantitative information on these  numbers is needed in order to obtain a reliable stability picture  for time-dependent linear systems and nonlinear systems.  He  examines applications of this tool to error control.  Efficient  and reliable techniques for computation of Lyapunov exponents  require study of orthogonal factorizations of time-dependent  matrices.  The investigator works on numerical solution of Riccati  equations, and develops an integration code based on Gauss  Runge-Kutta schemes.  He studies techniques for computation of  logarithms of matrices, emphasisizing the case of a sequence of  slowly varying matrices and its application to interpolants of  matrices.  Finally, he is writing a book on numerical dynamical  systems with emphasis on direct approximation techniques .       Differential equations are one of the most powerful models  to describe physical phenomena.  They provide a compact  description of a system by giving a continuous description of how  a given position in (phase) space of a system at a particular  time influences neighboring positions in the immediate future.  The price for such a compact description is that we then need to  solve the differential equation in order to obtain information  about the system.  Solving the differential equation, except in  trivial cases, cannot be done exactly, and we must resort to  numerical techniques.  The investigator devises numerical  techniques for differential equations, motivated by the following  question: What should we approximate, what should we monitor?  Existing techniques are typically very reliable at tracking a  specific solution (a trajectory) of the equation over a short  time interval, but they are inadequate to provide a complete  description of the system, which would need knowledge about many  solutions over long time intervals.  This need is particularly  true for models of complicated phenomena, which may take the form  of systems of coupled oscillators and coupled nonlinear  differential equations, or high-dimensional time-varying matrix  equations.  These cases are of interest in this project and find  applications in almost all applied sciences: from the study of  complicated biological and chemical interactions, to the optimal  control of time-dependent manufacturing processes, to stability  assessment for time-dependent phenomena in general.  In concrete,  the following issues are studied. (1) For many systems, all  solutions eventually approach a finite region of phase space, and  then stay there afterwards.  The investigator devises techniques  that target directly such eventual finite regions, to avoid  transient behavior. (2) A differential equation, because it  mimics a given physical system, usually has built in some key  properties.  For example, in modeling a rigid rotat ion, the  solutions of the differential equation should be rigid rotations.  Unfortunately, most numerical techniques will fail at preserving  even such a seemingly simple characteristic.  The failure of a  numerical method to preserve essential characteristics might have  very unpleasant effects.  The investigator works on techniques  that maintain the relevant geometrical properties of the  solutions. (3) For a given model, the fundamental question is the  one of stability.  How robust is the model? How sensitive are  solutions to small changes in the model? Or, in a deceivingly  different but mathematically equivalent way, how fast is a system  approaching its eventual state? The investigator studies ways to  monitor indicators in order to answer these questions, and also  applies this study to assess error propagation during  discretization.",
