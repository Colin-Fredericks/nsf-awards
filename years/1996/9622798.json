 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622798  Alexandru Nica        The problems addressed by the project are in free probability theory   - a line of research in operator algebras which parallels aspects of classical   probability, in a context where tensor products are replaced by free products,   and independent random variables are replaced by free random variables. The   proposed research reflects the interplay between two main directions in   the development of the theory, namely that: while (on one hand) studying   the parallelism between freeness and independence is of intrinsic interest,   we have (on the other hand) that free probability is a powerful tool for   attacking hard problems on free products of operator algebras. The main object   of study, called the  R-transform, is a free non-commutative  analog for   the logarithm of the Fourier  transform of a (multivariable) probability   distribution. In recent work, the multivariable R-transfopm has emerged as  an elegant and at the same time far-reaching instrument in the study of the  freeness phenomenon; we present problems that naturally come in the   continuation of this promising direction of research. Problems related to a  remarkable interpolation, depending on a parameter q in  0,1 , between the  R-transform and its commutative counterpart; and problems related to an  asymptotic model for freeness, based on random permutations, are also discussed.        The notion of random variable, and the concept of independence for random  variables are basic elements in the language of probability theory. Random  variables can be added and multiplied together, and built in their definition  is the fact that the product of two random variables f and g does not depend on   the order in which they are considered (always fg = gf). In the field of free  probability, the latter assumption is dropped, and the concept of independence   is replaced by the one of freeness - a condition originally inspired from the   study of certain algebras associated to free groups. While free pr obability   was started in the 80's as part of an effort to approach some long-standing   problems in operator algebras, it is at present clear that we have to do with   a fertile mathematical theory, connected to other branches of mathematics   and science; recent contributions in the field were made, e.g., by quantum   physicists and algebraic combinatorists. The present project is concerned with   topics from free harmonic analysis - the `free analog' for the Fourier   analysis methods classically used in the study of random variables.",
