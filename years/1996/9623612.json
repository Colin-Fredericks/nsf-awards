 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623612  Tong    The research project will utilize light scattering and laser  Doppler   velocimetry   techniques  to   study   statistical  properties   of,  and  correlations  among   the   velocity,  temperature,  and  vorticity  fields  of  turbulent  thermal  convection  in water.  The experiments will investigate  (1)  the  spatial  structure  of  the coherent  motions  and  the  correlations   between   the   velocity   and    temperature  fluctuations  in turbulent convection, and (2)  new  scaling  laws  of  velocity  and  vorticity statistics  over  varying  Rayleigh  numbers  and length scales in the  turbulent  core  region  and  near  the boundary layers.   The  project  will  provide a body of reliable data to test current theories for  turbulent convection and to understand key features  in  the  turbulent heat transport and in the atmospheric convection.  %%%  The research project will utilize light scattering and laser  Doppler velocimetry techniques (similar to automobile  laser  radar)   to study statistical properties of turbulent motion  in  thermal  convection.  The proposed  experiments  are  of  fundamental  interest  for  understanding  the   nature   of  convective  turbulence, and they are also relevant  to  many  practical   applications  in  engineering,  geography,   and  meteorology.   The project will provide a body  of  reliable  data  to  understand  key features  in  the  turbulent  heat  transport  and in the atmospheric convection.  Understanding  the   heat  transport  phenomena  under  different  boundary  conditions will shed new light on technological improvements  for  more  efficient  heat transfer  in  various  industrial  applications  ranging  from heat  exchangers  in  a  nuclear  reactor  to  a  reentry vehicle.  The development  of  novel  laser  light  scattering  techniques  will  have  additional  applications in the discipline of fluid mechanics.  ***",
