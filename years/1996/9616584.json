This center will eventually address pressing issues in the integration of research and education, train postdoctoral scholars to work at the intersection of technology and instruction, support a community-wide dialogue about the future of educational technology, and develop or refine methodologies that enable this work.    Collaborative partners are SRI International, the University of California at Berkeley, and Vanderbilt University.  Teams will share research approaches and findings in detail, identify commonalties and differences in finding and approach, establish priorities, and commission activities.  During the planning year, the team concept will be tried out and evaluated with initial activation of one theme team.  Planning year activities include also the design of a system for continuous evaluation and refinement of CRLT activities, development of a plan for postdoctoral interdisciplinary research training, and the establishment of linkages to leverage the intellectual and financial contributions of other investigators and institutions, including university scientists, school systems, industry scientists and groups, think tanks, technology-based corporations and libraries.  The World Wide Web will be an integral part of the Center's communication and dissemination activities.",
