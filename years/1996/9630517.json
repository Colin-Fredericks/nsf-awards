This project is titled \"Prehistoric Gallery:  Planning for Science Education Components\".  The subject of the  planning activity is part of their master plan for facility  renovation and interpretation.  Two approx. 10,000 square foot  exhibit halls are being developed; the first is the recently opened  Paths of Life: American Indians of the Southwest.  The second, and  the subject of this planning project, is Journeys of the Ancestors:  Ancient Peoples of the Southwest.  The planning activities will  consist of 1) travel by the ASM planning committee to seven museums  to discuss exhibit philosophy, interpretive strategies, and exhibit  techniques; 2) an interpretive design seminar that will bring  together a multidisciplinary team of scientists, science educators,  exhibit designers, and others to share ideas on the design,  content, and educational activities for this new hall; 3)  additional a front-end evaluation to test effectiveness of the  themes, strategies, and learning activities with different segments  of their potential audience; 4) a planning session with area  teachers to examine the relationship between the exhibit and the  curricular needs.",
