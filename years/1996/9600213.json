 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Assistant Professor Minami Yoda of  Georgia Institute of Technology to collaborate in mechanical  engineering research with Professor F.T.M. Nieuwstadt of the  Laboratory of Aeroand Hydrodynamics of the Delft University  of Technology, The Netherlands.  Using particle imaging  velocimetry, they will carry out a study of a turbulent  boundary layer with and without suction in the vicinity of a  few holes of a diameter of ten percent of the local boundary  layer thickness.  The Dutch laboratory has excellent  experimental facilities for this research, and the  experience with their set-up to be gained by the US PI will  provide the basis for deciding whether and how to establish  similar facilities at Georgia Tech.  The two laboratories  bring to the research effort complementary expertise in both  hydrodynamic systems and specialized instrumentation: Delft  in bounded flows and the application of particle imaging  velocimetry and Georgia Tech in free shear flow control and  laser-induced fluorescence.  Turbulence increases drag (and operating cost) on moving  surfaces such as airplane wings.  Suction is known to re-  laminarize and delay the separation of turbulent boundary  layers, but too much suction can actually increase the  separation.  Suction through large holes or slots has been  widely studied; smaller holes work better, but the cost of  implementing has been found not to be worth the savings in  drag.  While new technology now permits economical  production of minutely perforated surfaces, relatively  little is known about the effect of suction on such small  holes on the boundary layer structure.  This work will help  to clarify how such suction affects the coherent structures  in the boundary layers, and increase understanding of  `aerodynamic roughness`, where strong suction levels  actually cause separation.",
