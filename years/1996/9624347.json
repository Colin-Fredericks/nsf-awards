 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Career award emphasizes the development of tools for  modeling identification, and response of mechanical systems  that include dynamical dry friction. Typical examples of  such systems include automobile squeak, rail-wheel squeal,  metal cutting processes, and many other manufacturing  applications. These phenomenon are inherently nonlinear and  their realistic modeling is crucial to understanding their  true dynamic behavior primarily applied to automotive  squeak. The approach involves wavelets to quantify the  frequency-time characteristics of the stick-slip and noise  events. Modern dimensionality theory incorporating state  space variables is used to accommodate the nonsmoothness of  stick-slip systems. Direct measurements of friction during  velocity reversals lead to establishing relationships  between the friction and the displacements, velocities,  accelerations, and time. Educational innovations include  developing a nonlinear oscillation course for off-campus  delivery, incorporating computers in courses, projecting  animations in lectures, and performing physical  demonstrations in the classroom to illustrate complex  dynamic phenomena.",
