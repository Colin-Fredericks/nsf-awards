 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  9631287    This award will provide funds for an enhanced applied mathematics PhD program at the University of Delaware  by incorporating an internship at a suitable government laboratory or industrial site.  The applied mathematics group at the University of Delaware is eager to develop its relationships with industrial contacts more fully, both to tap a rich source of ideas and problems and also to enhance graduate education.  With real practical experience in an industrial setting, graduate students will have better training and increased flexibility of employment.  The Principal Investigators  plan an industrial internship program with some key industrial contacts who have agreed to accept suitable interns and help develop the program.    The bulk of the funds to be awarded will finance enough graduate interns to allow the program to demonstrate its viability by establishing a reputation and portfolio of successful projects.  The goal is to have a vibrant and self sufficient program that can expand to include students from all the applied mathematics faculty.  This award is consistent with the GOALI activity, in that the funding awarded is centered on the activity of graduate students who will be in real industrial settings.",
