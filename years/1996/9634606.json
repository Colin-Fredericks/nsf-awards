Experiments will be conducted at the Corrsin laminar  flow wind tunnel at Hopkins and at the new boundary layer tunnel  at Roorkee.  The investigators will study the specific use and  interpretation of bridge deck section models and building models in  the respective wind tunnels.  Theory developed at Hopkins on the  use of flutter derivatives in determining wind stability will be used  relative to section models at Roorkee and Hopkins.  The research  will investigate the detailed geometric forms needed to enhance  stability in deck models.    Scope:  This award will allow travel between the research sites to  complete the agreed upon level of effort.  The funds requested for  the entire research project are modest at about $30,000.  This  project will continue development of the flutter derivatives concept,  considered a major advance in wind engineering, and extend abroad  the influence of U.S. technology in aerodynamic design.  For India,  the project will contribute to developing modelling expertise,  technical education, and improvements in design and construction  methods.    ***",
