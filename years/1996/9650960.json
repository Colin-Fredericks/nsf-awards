 "awd_abstract_narration": "Expectations set forth by the mathematics professionals in the AMATYC standards, and by business and industry leaders in the SCANS Report, recommend that students entering the workforce be prepared to (1) gather, display, and analyze real-world data and then communicate their findings; (2) understand how to integrate concepts in math with science or engineering or liberal arts through data gathering and problem-solving experiences; and (3) be able to use new technologies and recognize them as valuable instructional tools.   This project uses TI-92 calculators in conjunction with the Calculator-Based Laboratories (CBLs) for its three comprehensive instructional sites in order to address workforce expectations and help students become active learners in mathematics. With this equipment, students can engage in class or small group projects that solve realistic problems.   CAS software has not been available for classroom use in precalculus or calculus, science, or engineering technology courses. Faculty who have used graphing calculators can attend a CAS Short Course. Faculty, upon return, can train their colleagues in developing classroom activities using the TI-92 in combination with the CBL in mathematics and science classes.   The faculty training and development of classroom activities can be shared via a World Wide Web site on the Internet and at state and national professional meetings.",
