 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported  in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, seeks to develop  four new techniques with which to study solid surfaces that serve  to catalyze reactions.  Professor Munson will develop an in situ  flow magic-angle spinning (MAS) solid state nuclear magnetic  resonance (NMR) spectrometer probe.  Two dimensional pulse  strategies will also be developed to follow chemical species  during catalytic reactions.  Spin-polarized xenon will be used to  study low to medium surface areas catalysts where sensitivity is  a problem and a large volume MAS probe will be constructed to  increase the allowed sample size by at least an order of  magnitude.  During the tenure of this four-year continuing grant,  Professor Munson and his students at the University of Minnesota  will apply these new techniques to the study of partial oxidation  catalysis reactions that incorporate functional groups such as  epoxides, aldehydes and carboxylic acids into products.  Olefin  metathesis reactions that break carbon-carbon double bonds with  the formation of two new carbon-carbon double bonds will also be  studied during this CAREER research project.  Professor Munson's  educational plan involves exciting students at the high school,  undergraduate and graduate level about topics in chemistry.  An  NMR spectrometer has already been built at the University of  Minnesota that will be available for loan to local undergraduate  institutions in order to help create excitement about the field  of chemistry.  Incorporation of multimedia materials for use in  the classroom at each of these levels is also planned.  The field of heterogeneous catalysis is extremely important to  the future vitality of the scientific enterprise as the need to  do chemistry under lower energy consuming conditions and to  minimize the environmental impact of chemical synthesis becomes  more critical.  Through the planned work of Professor Munson's  CAREER research project, a concerted effort will be directed to  problems of this type.  This activity will be enriching for the  students involved in doing this science and it will provide  exciting examples to students elsewhere about the power of the  chemical sciences.",
