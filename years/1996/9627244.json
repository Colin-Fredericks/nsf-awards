 "awd_abstract_narration": "Farrell  9622744    The investigator, together with colleagues in Ireland and Russia,  develops epsilon-uniformly convergent finite difference schemes  for singularly perturbed equations.  Unlike classical schemes,  such schemes have the advantage that the errors do not depend on  an inverse power of the small parameter epsilon, and hence do not  become unbounded as epsilon approaches zero.  The aim of this  project is to develop methods for a number of nonlinear ordinary  differential equations, and linear and nonlinear partial  differential equations of elliptic and parabolic type, using  meshes that are condensed (refined) in the boundary layers.   These meshes usually involve at least one free parameter.  They  investigate the influence of these parameters on the accuracy of  the approximation and the speed of convergence of linear and  nonlinear solvers.  The investigator implements these methods on  parallel (shared memory) and distributed computers.  This  involves theoretical work on convergence of Schwarz type methods  of domain decomposition and their parallel variants, as well as  comparisons of the efficiency of various parallel and sequential  methods.  They also study efficient solvers for the linear  systems arising from these problems, which can be highly  nonsymmetric for small epsilon.    Singularly perturbed differential equations are pervasive in  applications of mathematics to problems in the sciences and  engineering.  Among these are the Navier-Stokes equations of  fluid flow at high Reynolds number, the drift-diffusion equations  of semiconductor device physics, the Michaelis-Menten theory for  enzyme reactions, and mathematical models of liquid crystal  materials and of chemical reactions.  The development of  efficient generalizable methods for such equations, which yield  guaranteed bounds on the error independent of the value of the  small perturbation parameter, is thus of considerable  significance in a number of important areas.",
