 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Numic Comparative Lexicon is a cooperative effort among four  specialists to build a computerized data base for the seven  languages of the Numic branch of the Uto-Aztecan language family  and to make a new and definitive reconstruction of Proto-Numic.  Bands speaking Numic languages lived in every western state in  the United States, except for Washington, and in early  postcontact times ranged as far north as Alberta and  Saskatchewan. One band also occupied a large area in the South  Plains. A complete reconstruction of these languages is therefore  an important link in the understanding of the prehistory of the  western United States. In addition to internal relationships, the  Numic languages also had extensive contact with neighboring  groups speaking unrelated languages. A complete data base of the  Numic languages will aid in the identification of borrowings in  other languages and further clarify the history of the region  surrounding the Great Basin. The project brings together all  known lexicons and vocabularies using commercially available  software on a Power Macintosh 7100 computer. This makes possible  not only detailed cross-linguistic comparisons, but also  comprehensive historical analyses and wide-ranging dialect  studies. The data base is designed for efficiency and flexibility  of data handling. After gathering all the data in a single  location, a larger and more reliable body of reconstructed  Proto-Numic forms and cognate sets will be ready for  incorporation into Uto-Aztecan cognate sets than has heretofore  been available. The use of commercially available software with  compatible Macintosh and IBM versions will make the computerized  data base readily available to as broad a spectrum of scholars as  possible. In addition, the data base will be available for use to  supplement tribal literacy courses throughout the Numic area. The  number of speakers of Numic languages ranges from fewer than 10  (for Kawaiisu and Panamint) to more than 500 (for Southern  Paiute).  The vast majority of the speakers listed above are over  50 years of age. This state of affairs makes the compilation of a  thorough comparative dictionary of the Numic languages quite  pressing while there are still speakers who command their  languages and can provide information where data are lacking in  currently available sources.",
