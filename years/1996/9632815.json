 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the use of SF5-containing epoxides and   acrylates  as photopolymerizable synthons for the production of durable   polymer films and coatings.  The synthons, in small concentrations, will   partition to interfaces and create fluorine enriched overlayers.     Targeted epoxides and acrylates will be synthesized from SF5-iodides,   olefins, acylfluorides and alcohols.  The structure of the films will be   determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and infrared   analysis, while film properties, including refractive index, dielectric   constant and surface energy will also be measured.  With this new award,   the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Gary L.   Gard of the Department of Chemistry at Portland State University.    Professor Gard will focus his work on using new and unique fluorinated   photopolymerizable synthons to form new durable polymer films and   coatings.  Fluorinated films and coatings possess high dielectric   strength, low refractive index and excellent environmental stability.",
