 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Northern Caddoan Dictionaries Project\" will complete  reference dictionaries of Arikara and Pawnee, closely related  American Indian languages of the Caddoan family. Today these  languages are spoken by fewer than a dozen elderly tribal members  in North Dakota and Oklahoma. The project will complete  compilation of three databases from which the dictionaries will  be generated, for Arikara, Skiri Pawnee, and South Band Pawnee.  Comprising each of those databases will be both written and sound  material.          Each of the databases will provide material from which the  project will generate three products for each of those three  groups. The first is a conventional printed dictionary. The  second a valuable and innovative product in the documentation of  endangered languages is a multimedia dictionary for use with  personal computers. The multimedia dictionary will be published  in CD-ROM format and present the same information as the printed  volume. In addition, it will provide sound recordings of every  word main entry and grammatical and other illustrative forms and  offer many useful features for searching and cross-referencing. A  third product is development of an enduring, non-proprietary  method of storing the dictionary databases that is accessible to  a broad range of operating systems and hardware platforms and  that will allow dissemination and publication of research in a  format that will not be rendered technologically obsolete.          The dictionaries, each to contain approximately 10,000  entries, will draw upon all available lexical and textual  materials: data collected by the PI over the past twenty-five  years; data collected by anthropologists earlier in the century;  and data in historical sources. Ten months of additional field  work are necessary, most of which will be with Arikara and the  South Band dialect of Pawnee.         The project, part of a larger effort to document the Pawnee  and Arikara languages as fully as possible, will result in the  first  reference dictionaries ever compiled for them. The  dictionaries, moreover, will provide essential data for the  comparative study of the Caddoan language family and the  interrelationships of the Caddoan languages with other  genetically related language families in the New World. Because  Pawnee and Arikara are complex polysynthetic languages, these  dictionaries will be of particular interest to typologists and  theoreticians. They will also serve as reference tools for  scholars and in language classes taught in the Arikara and Pawnee  communities.",
