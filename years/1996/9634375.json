The project will  formulate and investigate certain generic optimal hybrid control  problems which are strongly motivated by the problem of  stabilization and performance optimization in automotive  powertrain systems.  In terms of automotive applications, the  discrete actions will be VDE (variable displacement engine) and  transmission gear selections.  Performance measure will then be  introduced to formulate an optimal hybrid control problem.   Feasible hybrid control methods will be investigated and developed.       This project will be of importance in gaining a better  understanding of essential features of hybrid control systems,  and in developing reliable design methods for hybrid systems.   The approach of employing powertrain control as benchmark  problems will provide the PI and industry collaborators with  insightful motivations for problem formulation, clarifying  criteria for justifying design assumptions, and a platform for  design verification.  This project will provide certain benchmark  problems and feasible control strategies for hybrid systems, and  contribute toward narrowing the gaps between good intuition and  rigorous problem formulation, between trial-and-error design and  reliable control methods, and between application-oriented  methodologies and mathematical theory.  The project will provide  an excellent opportunity for intensive long-term cooperation  between the PI and researchers at Ford Motor Company. Several  Ph.D. students of the PI will participate in the project as part  of their dissertation research and will be jointly supervised by  the industry collaborators. A graduate-level course on automotive  control systems will be developed.  ***",
