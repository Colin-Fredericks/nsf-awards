 "awd_abstract_narration": "9555734  Frierson    The Valencia BRIDGES program (Building and Replicating an Innovative  Demonstration Model to Facilitate Gender Equity in Science) will focus on  activities that increase students, faculty, and counselors understanding of   the relationships between gender and the study of science. The project will  increase the academic, retention, and completion success rates of female  community college students enrolled in science courses,  develop a new  instructional approach to better prepare females for upper division study and  careers involving scientific research, and increase the percentage of female  students enrolled in science courses by helping female students make  informed career choices and better course selection decisions.  Curricular  changes include a new lower division research methods course, enriched  lower division biological and physical science courses with strategies and  content that are free of gender bias, mentoring opportunities for students,  hands-on internships in research laboratories at the University of Florida,  scientific and equity workshops targeted at the female student population,  new recruitment and promotion materials to targeted students, and  specialized counseling and mentoring interactions which focus on personal,  transfer, career, and financial aid issues.    Community college students are less likely to have research and mentoring  experiences that lead to research-based scientific careers.  This project will  reform lower level science courses to be more accessible for all students and  will partner with the state land grant institution to prepare community  college students for university-level science courses.  Mentorships will act as  an informal network to increase student success.  ***     9555807  Ash    The Chabot Observatory & Science Center (COSC) will develop an  environmental curriculum implementation project called FIRST: Female  Involvement in Real Science and Technology.  This comprehensive,  sequential scientific initiati ve will be developed and produced in collaboration  with local school districts, colleges, museums, and professional societies.  FIRST will involve students in grades 5 through 8, and their teachers,  administrators, care givers, and the families.  The participants will explore  critical environmental issues, envisioning themselves as effective shapers of  their environment now and in the future.  The program will reach 60  elementary schools and 15 junior high/middle schools, with over 35,000  students total, and 1,200 teachers will receive training each year.  This  project unites and builds upon the systemic reform begun by previous NSF-  funded projects at Mills College and Department of Energy-funded  collaborative education programs.        Interactive environmental studies allow middle and high school students and  their families to enrich their knowledge by discussing real life science  questions.  Teaching and learning in both formal and informal settings will  help teachers, students, and community members of an urban multilingual,  multicultural population explore environmental issues that effect their lives  on a daily basis.  ***   9554188  Austin    This project will determine how transactional writing, i.e., writing used to  develop, construct and express mathematical understanding, effects  females' achievement in, and attitude toward, their college and middle  school mathematics classes.  The project will target three different groups of  student participants in the basic and intermediate college algebra sequence,  as well as in one group of participants in a three-year middle school  mathematics sequence.  College level achievement will be measured by the  Elementary Algebra Skills test; the Stanford Achievement Test will measure  achievement on the middle school level.  Attitude toward math will be  measured by the Revised Mathematics Attitude Scale.    Teams of mathematics and English faculty investigators, and their female  students, from a large, urban two-year college and  participating middle  schools from a large, urban public school system will create an academic  community through the use of the college's electronic bulletin board. The  project will intervene at the two critical points that hinder girls staying with  and succeeding at mathematics and hence, women successfully pursing  mathematics-based careers and reaching higher income levels: lack of  achievement and poor attitude. Transactional writing can be an instrument in  the construction of knowledge and the reshaping of beliefs.    Writing about math helps students more easily learn mathematical concepts.   Students from middle schools and a community college will use a technique  called transactional writing to make them active learners. This, along with  mentoring and career counseling, will help them become more interesting in  math and science careers.  ***                                        9555817  Fontaine        Elizabeth City State University and five rural, economically disadvantaged,  predominately African-American public school systems will implement a  comprehensive regional project, entitled the Dr. C.D. Turnage Science, Math  and Technology Scholars Program for Girls. The goals are to create positive  and permanent changes in academic, social, and scientific climates in order  to allow the interest and aptitude women and girls display in science,  engineering, and mathematics (SEM) to flourish and to add to our knowledge  about interactions between gender and the SEM infrastructure. The program  will include: teachers, counselors, and central office staff, female eighth  graders, parents, business and industry. The project will train 300 educators,  200 teachers, 50 administrators, 25 counselors, and 25 central office staff  members in the areas of enhancing access to equity education and equitable  opportunities, gender equity expectations for student achievement,  EQUALS  Training, multidisciplinary mathematics and science, constructivism in  science and mathematics, and  alterna tive assessment. 240 eighth grade  girls will participate in after school clubs, a Saturday academy, and a  summer enrichment institute designed to enhance their education and  careers in the fields of science, mathematics, and technology. Parents will  attend activities with their daughters to provide input in their educational  programs.  A Scholars Program manual will be made available to each  state's division of science, math and technology to help them replicate this  program.        A partnership among university, public school and local businesses will work  to create a positive climate for mathematics and science learning among  middle school students. Led by Elizabeth City State University faculty,  school personnel will examine how to deliver equitable education to all  students. This will result in more students enrolling and succeeding in upper  level math and science courses.  *** 9555724  Kraemer    Girl Scouts in grades K-12 will learn and apply science, engineering, and  mathematics principles using interactive computer systems in conjunction  with math and science badge work. PLUGGED IN! is a collaboration of  Ottawa University and Mid-Continent Council of Girl Scouts. Girls will  advance in computer and science literacy by completing age-appropriate  computer assisted modules to develop skills in computer science, problem-  solving, research and critical thinking; explore Internet communication and  international perspectives of scientific data gathering; experiment with  microscopes, telescopes, weather station output technology, and computer-  interfaced data analysis; explore careers in science, engineering and  mathematics through mentoring; and completing Girl Scout science and  math activities from mobile units, as well as at remote sites. This project will  serve as a model for Girl Scouts of the USA, which serves a membership of  3.5 million.    Ho",
