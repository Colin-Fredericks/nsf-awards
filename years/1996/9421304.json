 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421304  Kim  In this proposal, optical spectral holeburning is considered with Raman  coherent population trapping in a folded three level lambda system. This is  a novel technique which allows storage (and retrieval) of optical data with  potentially significant advantages over conventional schemes. Each data  pulse is composed of the two optical frequencies corresponding to the two  legs of the lambda transition. The information about the pulse amplitudes  and separations are encoded in the spin-rather than optical-coherence. This  coherence is created by a two-photon process, so that its amplitude is  proportional to the product of the amplitudes of electric fields (i.e.,  geometric mean intensity) of the two frequencies, and oscillates in phase  with the beat frequency. Thus, both amplitude and phase sensitive optical  data, encoded in the geometric mean intensity and the phase of the beat  frequency, respectively, can be stored.    This scheme of data storage and retrieval may have significant advantages  over existing techniques. For example, the write window is determined by  two time scales: the homogeneous decay time of the spin coherence, and the  two-photon correlation time. This relaxes two constraints of optical data  storage. First, only the ground-state coherences, and not the optical  coherences, have to be long lived. Noting that spin coherences with  lifetimes up to approx.1 second are known to exist in certain solids at  room temperature, this technique opens up the possibility of finding high  density optical data storage materials above liquid nitrogen temperature.  Second, the laser frequency does not have to be highly stabilized, since  the two photon correlation time can be made independent of single frequency  linewidth if one laser frequency is generated from the other via  acousto-optic modulation, for example. Finally, this system may be used to  enhance the storage density since, in addition to the spin coherence, the  Raman excitation can create optical coherence.  Therefore, optical data can  be stored in holes burnt in a two-dimensional frequency space, leading to a  five-dimensional data storage. In the time domain picture, such a combined  scheme corresponds to extension of the write window, enabling the memory  capacity (at a single position) to exceed the current fundamental limit  imposed by the ratio of the optical inhomogeneous to homogeneous  linewidths.    The basic physics of optical spectral holeburning using Raman coherent  population trapping will be studied to determine suitability for potential  applications to optical data storage and image processing. This will be  accomplished by performing experimental and theoretical studies of spectral  holeburning in rare-earth doped crystals. Specific experiments include  basic characterization of Raman population trapping in a doped crystal,  storage and retrieval of optical data with Raman-excited spin echoes in  solids using modestly stabilized lasers, and basic demonstration of  enhanced storage density via spectral hole burning in a two dimensional  frequency space. Theoretical calculations will include more than two  ground-states in order to more closely match the characteristics of the  actual systems. Finally, projections will be made, based on the  experimental and theoretical results, as to the feasibility of practical  optical memories with Raman population trapping.  ***",
