 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    Shull  9511934    If an individual is obtaining some type of reward by  responding, what happens if additional rewards are freely  given, regardless of what the individual is doing?  One  obvious effect is that the rate of the operant response  declines.  But free rewards can also enhance the persistence  of the response--at least that is what research with pigeons  has demonstrated.  When conditions are made less favorable  for responding (e.g., when the subject is satiated or when  the delivery of all rewards in halted), responding will  persist longer if additional free rewards had been provided  in the context than if they had not been.    An implication is that the rate and the persistence of  operant behavior are not aspects of a single process like   response strength  but are, instead, independent properties  of behavior controlled by different classes of variables.  The rate of operant behavior (i.e., the inclination to  engage in the behavior) depends on the strength of the  operant contingency-- that is, on the proportion of the  total reinforcers that are obtained by the particular  response.  Persistence appears to depend on the degree to  which the context in which the response occurs signals an  increase or a decrease in the rate of reinforcers regardless  of whether or not the response produces those reinforcers.    One interpretation of the persistence effect is that the  freely delivered rewards make the context in which they  occur more arousing or emotionally exciting through a  Pavlovian conditioning process.  The emotional excitement,  in turn, feeds into the operant behavior making it  relatively more persistent in the face of worsening  conditions.  A possible practical implication is that one  can enhance the persistence of a response by presenting  reinforcers freely in the context in which the response  occurs (e.g., in a classroom) even though doing so will  likely reduce the rate of the response.    It is possible, however, that  the rate and persistence of  behavior appear to be independent properties only because  response rate in our usual experimental preparations is a  mixture of different kinds of behavioral events.  The  proposal provides a formal development of this possibility,  based on the assumption that response rate, as usually  measured, is comprised of  initiations  of activity and  performance during the activity.  The rate of initiations  corresponds most closely to the everyday sense of an  inclination to engage in an activity.  An implication is  that the rate and persistence of the usual measure of  response rate can appear independent even though the rate  and persistence of initiations are correlated.    The proposed experiments are intended to examine the effects  of additional free reinforcers on the rate and persistence  of initiations.  Several preparations are described that  should provide a measure approximating initiation rate, as  distinct from the composite rate.  The important question is  whether the rate and persistence of initiation rates covary  as a function of the operant contingency or are independent.  The subjects will be rats.  The response will be lever  pressing for food reinforcers.",
