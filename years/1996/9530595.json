 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the   Chemistry Division, Ben-Amotz will study the influence of solute-solvent   interactions on chemical reactions using pressure- and   temperature-dependent optical spectroscopic studies as well as   theoretical modeling.  Dissociation, isomerization, and ion-pairing model   reactions will be studied, and changes in the equilibrium constants for   model reactions will be measured in organic solvents as well as in   supercritical argon, xenon, and water using high-pressure Raman, FTIR,   and UV/visible spectroscopies in diamond anvil supercritical fluid   pressure cells.  The results will be used to test theoretical models   derived from liquid perturbation theory using both a first-principles   approach as well as a semi-empirical perturbed hard fluid (PHF) model.    Predicted and experimental results will be compared over a wide pressure   and temperature range in both liquid and supercritical fluid solvents.  The value of using predictive models to calculate properties of systems,   especially those under extreme conditions of temperature or pressure, has   become widely recognized by engineers.  These studies will contribute to   our ability to predict chemical reaction equilibria under increasingly   extreme and complex condensed phase conditions.  The results of this work   are likely to be important to industrial chemical synthesis, waste   recovery, and separation technologies.",
