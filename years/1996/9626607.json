 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry Program, investigates the design and spectroscopic  characterization of monolayers formed by the adsorption of  surfactants, polypeptides and oligonucleotides at liquid/liquid  interfaces and at chemically modified metal surfaces.  During the  tenure of this three-year continuing grant, Professor Corn and  his students at the University of Wisconsin will utilize  molecular second harmonic generation (SHG) to probe  spectroscopically the structure of the liquid/liquid interface.   This information is useful for developing an understanding of ion  transport across biological membranes, for the design of systems  for DNA detection and identification, and for the control of  biomimetic systems formed from self-assembled monolayers.  The  tools and information developed in the course of this research  have wide application in a number of areas of fundamental  analytical technology.  Spectroscopic probes of the orientation of molecules adsorbed at  the liquid/liquid interface and in organic overlayers on metallic  surfaces are being developed in this research program.  Non-  linear laser spectroscopic probes, and reflection absorption  infrared and plasmon resonance spectroscopies are used to  investigate the orientation and structure of molecules at these  interfaces.  Information obtained from these studies will be  useful in the development of new analytical methodologies, as  well as forming a fundamental base for the exploitation of  biological models of information storage and computing.",
