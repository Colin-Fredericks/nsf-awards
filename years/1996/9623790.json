 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will undertake analysis of data to increase our  understanding of the possible signatures of magnetopause and  magnetospheric boundary layer processes that are observed in the  ionosphere and on the ground.  The study will focus specifically on  a search for simultaneous observations of two different geomagnetic  perturbation phenomena whose possible sources may be either the  magnetopause or the upstream solar wind.  The phenomena that will  be studied are Pc 3 micropulsations and high latitude magnetic  impulse events known as traveling convection vortices (TCVs).  Pc  3 micropulsations are quasi-periodic pertubations of the Earth's  magnetic field with periods between 10 and 45 seconds.  One sources  of these pulsations is believed to be the upstream solarwind.  High  latitude magnetic impulse events are large amplitude (100nt), often  monopolar pulsations of the geomagnetic field with periods of 10 -  20 minute duration.  Interest in these pulsations was stimulated by  the hypothesis that they consituted the ionospheric signature of  sporatic reconnection -- though this speculation has become very  controversial.  Recent work suggests that these may occur on closed  field lines.  The possible connection between Pc 3 and TCVs has not  been undertaken.  There have, however, been some observations to  indicate that Pc 3 events can occur simultaneously with TCV events  and propagate with the same horizontal speed.  This suggests that  they may occur on the same field lines and share a common source.   A detailed study is needed to develop a conclusive determination of  a possible relationship between the two phenomena.  This will be  accomplished using data from the MACCS magnetometer array in  northern Canada.",
