 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Fred Wendorf will conduct archaeological excavations in the Nabta Playa region which is located in southwestern Egypt. Previous work has indicated the presence of prehistoric cattle pastoralists in the area from about 9,000 to 5,300 years ago. (After that time rainfall decreased and the area was abandoned.) Visible remains in the playa include several megalithic alignments, stone `calendar circles`, two small stone tumuli covering burials of cattle and 34 largaer tumuli clustered into three groups. Based on these preliminary information, Nabta appears to have served as a regional ceremonial center and more recent counterparts are known from the southern Sahara margin. While these latter are much younger they often cover burial chambers for leaders. Dr. Wendorf will partially excavate one of the Nabta mounds to determine what it contains, to collect datable organic materials and to determine how the structure was built  If skeletal materials are recovered these data will provide the basis to design  a larger longer term research project.  Archaeologists wish to understand how complex societies arise and are maintained. Although a great deal is known about the Pharonic period of Egyptian civilization, its antecedents are very poorly understood. Preliminary Nabta research suggests that stratified social organization may date to at least 6,000 years ago in a pastoralist context. Dr. Wendorf's work may shed light on the starting point of the developmental process.",
