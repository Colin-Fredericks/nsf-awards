 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a major reorganization of the laboratories for the second half of the introductory physics sequence for all science majors and pre-engineers (approximately 80 students each year). This continues the restructuring, begun in 1990, of the introductory laboratory sequence for these majors. The department is organizing four laboratory modules, Wave Motion, Electricity and Magnetism, Optics, and Modern Physics, each requiring 3 to 4 weeks to complete. Each module contains several innovative experiments that are run weekly until the module is completed by all of the students. This arrangement reduces the number of setups for an individual experiment, resulting in significant cost reductions to the university and its sponsors.   This project specifically addresses Module 2, Electricity and Magnetism. Classic experiments have been merged with new approaches to introduce the student to the concepts of exponential decay in physical situations, behavior of pulses in transmission lines, and experimental determination of fundamental constants. The exercises encourage creative curiosity and rely heavily on the use of analytical techniques made possible by computers. The module represents a more loosely structured laboratory than the conventional approach in which everyone does the same experiment at the same time. The involvement of the students in discussions with one another and the enhancement of creative curiosity should occur more readily in a less structured environment.   The project uses student focus groups, survey instruments, and observations in formative and summative evaluation. Dissemination products include course materials, software, a laboratory manual, and final evaluation reports.",
