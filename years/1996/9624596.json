 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grzegorz Szamel is supported by a Faculty Early Career Development Award   in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop a   theoretical understanding of thermoreversible polymer gelation and the   properties of thermoreversible gels. The specific problems to be studied   are: 1) existence and properties of a thermodynamic transition underlying   the observed gelation transition; 2) structure of the sol and gel phases;   3) elastic properties of the gel phase; and 4) viscoelastic properties of   the sol and gel phases.  The method to be used is a generalization of a   recent statistical mechanical approach to rubber vulcanization (formation   of a permanent polymer network) to the case of reversible crosslinking.     Specifically, a statistical mechanical theory of chemical association   will be used to describe reversible bonding of specific monomers   distributed randomly along polymer chains. A  replication approach will   be used to facilitate averaging over the positions of specific monomers.   Finally, an order parameter field (related to frozen density   fluctuations) will be introduced, and an effective free energy functional   will be derived. The free energy functional will be analyzed using   methods similar to those used in the study of the vulcanization   transition.  The goal of the education plan is to teach students the   value and significance of quantitative reasoning in physical chemistry,   and chemistry in general.   In particular, recitation classes will be   introduced into teaching the physical chemistry courses in order to   improve student's ability to solve chemical problems using the relevant   mathematical formalism.   Moreover, a new course on mathematical and   computational methods for chemists will be instituted in order to expose   students to the applications of numerical and simulational methods in   chemistry.  Polymer gels have attracted a lot of interest because of the wealth of   their potential practical applications.  Examples include drug delivery   devices, chemical valves and sensors, and magnetic resonance monitoring   agents.  Their properties can change drastically in response to external   stimuli such as temperature, electric field, or light.  Szamel's research   concentrates on one class of polymer gels, thermoreversible gels. These   gels originate from reversible crosslinking of polymeric systems.      These gels are reversible, i.e. they liquify upon heating, and are   regenerated upon cooling.",
