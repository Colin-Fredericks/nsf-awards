Six central topics are identified. The first project will  address the pinning of magnetic flux by disorder in some  of  the  new  superconducting  materials. This includes  a  study  of  the  process    by   which   the   flux   breaks   loose,   destroying  superconductivity,  at  high  currents.The  second  project  will  investigate  the  role of inhomogeneous conductance  among  small  magnetic  regions  in  determining  the  mechanism  for  colossal  magnetoresistance. The third topic will study the effect  on  the  \"solidity\"  of  the glass phase of some hidden long-range  order,  such  as  large-scale collective rearrangements  well  below  the  temperature  at  which gross annealing sets in. The  forth  topic  consists  in  the  study  of the effect of  local  anisotropy  in  determining  the qualitatively different mesoscopic  behavior  of  different  metallic  spin-glasses. The fifth project  will  study  which  of  the two mechanisms, simple pinning of magnetic  domain  walls  or  collective  domain-wall rearrangements,  is  the  most  important  in  determining the unevenness  of  the  magnetization  process  in  most  magnets. The nature of  relaxor  ferroelectric  behavior and comparison to spin-glass-like phenomenon will be the  last issue to be studied.  %%%  Almost  all  real  materials are not perfectly  crystalline,  but  rather  have  some disorder. In many cases (e.g.  glasses),  this  disorder  is  fundamental  to the structural  properties  of  the  material,  in  other cases (e.g. superconductors  in  a  magnetic  field)  it  is  crucial to understanding the dynamical  behavior.  Generally,  disorder  creates  situations  in  which  there   are  multiple  states  among which the system can  switch,  either  by  thermal  energy or under the influ ence of external driving.  Such  switches create noise in measurable properties. The goal of  this  project is to clarify how certain disordered structures form  and  respond  to external driving, mostly by using noise as  a  probe.  The  central issues to be addressed are: (1) In glasses, is  some  hidden  long-range  order responsible for the \"solidity\"  of  the  glass phase, despite the apparent randomness of the structure? At  what  temperature do large-scale collective rearrangements  occur  in  glasses?  (2)  In  the magnetic relative  of  glasses,  spin-  glasses,  what  parameters determine the range and  form  of  the  collective   behavior?   In   technological   important   relaxor  ferroelectrics, what determines the same properties? (3) How does  the underlying disorder in most magnets create the unevenness  of  the magnetization process? Is a simple pinning of magnetic domain  walls  involved,  or  are  collective domain-wall  rearrangements  important?   (4)  In  the  colossal  magnetoresistive  materials,  investigated  as  promising field sensors for magnetic  recording  and  other  applications,  what is  the  main  mechanism  of  the  magnetoresistive effect? Is inhomogeneous conductance among small  magnetic regions the key process?",
