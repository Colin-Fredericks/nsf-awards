 "awd_abstract_narration": "ECS-9619257  The Energy Systems and Control (CESAC) at Howard  University is dedicated to research in Power Systems for Utility  and Government foundations and outreach programs called EESI for  High School Students, with emphasis in Electrical  Engineering/Power Systems, and Artificial Intelligence  Applications.  We are proposing to extend these outreach  activities to include High School teachers in the Washington, DC  Metropolitan area.    These teachers will serve as a conduit for exposing a critical  mass of students as to why Power Systems education and career is  important.    The proposed work is aimed at a two-week summer outreach program  emphasizing the following:    (a)  Energy alternatives, economics consideration and modeling.     (b)  Basic Power System components and tools needed for analysis       and design.    (c)  Use of internet for problem solving in an engineering course       such as Network Analysis.    The extended EESI Program for teacher will spread over two (2)  weeks and will involve lectures, discussions and hands-on.  The  Principal Investigator (PI) and a graduate student in Power  Systems will be involved in the course delivery.    The experience obtained from this workshop will be documented in  an IEEE Power System Education Division paper.  ***",
