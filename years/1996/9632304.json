University of California, Santa Cruz  Title: Modeling Anthropogenic Desiccation of the Aral Sea: A Unique Test of the  Predictive Capabilities of a Regional Earth System Model    The utility of global and regional earth system models (ESMs) for investigating  causes of past climate change, and predicting impacts of future human activities,  depends on how accurately changes driven by specific perturbations are predicted.   This accuracy is controlled primarily by how well feedbacks are simulated.  The  accuracy of ESM-predicted changes is unknown, because previous model validation  has been limited to assessing how well present conditions are reproduced or  comparing paleoclimate model results with sparse and potentially ambiguous proxy  data.  In order to conduct a more thorough evaluation of ESM performance, model-  predicted and observed changes resulting from known perturbations over historical  timescales will be compared.    In this study, anthropogenic desiccation of the Aral Sea will be used as a test  of the predictive accuracy of a regional ESM (the RegCM2 and lake model  associated with the National Center for Atmospheric Research) that includes an  interactively coupled atmosphere and lake. Desiccation of the Aral Sea since  1960, resulting from diversion of water for intensive irrigation in the  surrounding basin, has been extensive enough to produce a regional climatic  response.  Desiccation of this magnitude should also produce a model response.   Importantly. meteorological and hydrologic observations that span the interval  of desiccation are available so the actual changes can be quantified.  The  predictive capabilities of the model will be tested by comparing model-simulated  changes with observed changes that have occurred between 1960 and 1995.    The work consists of three components.  First, observations will be used to  quantify regional climate and lake hydrologic changes that are likely due to Aral  Sea desiccation.  These obser ved changes will be used to (i) test model  predictions, (ii) directly measure how the presence of the Aral Sea alters  regional climate, (iii) directly measure how lake-level variations have impacted  the Aral Sea's hydrology, and (iv) quantify regional-scale human impacts.   Second, the interactively coupled Reg CM2-lake model's strengths and weaknesses  in predicting changes will be assessed, by comparing simulated and observed  desiccation-induced regional climate and lake hydrologic changes.  In order to  gain a more thorough understanding of the causes for the coupled model's  successes and failures, the predictive accuracy of independent (non-interactive)  versions of RegCM2 and the lake model, driven by meteorological or hydrologic  observations, will also be evaluated.  Third, the regional climate effects  generated by the Aral for seas of different surface area, depth and salinity will  be calculated.  This will allow: (i) quantification of lake-atmosphere  interactions and feedbacks associated with lake-level variations; (ii) prediction  of future climate changes driven by further anthropogenic Arals Sea desiccation;  and (iii) assessment of how much of the model predicted change between pre-  desiccation and -present and present intervals was due to large-scale  meteorological variability.  Predictions of future climate changes resulting from  additional desiccation will be prepared and evaluated in terms of the model's  strengths and weaknesses as determined.  This research is important because it  seeks to test how well coupled regional climate lake models predict the impact  of human activities on a large shallow terminal lake and how that feedbacks on  the regional and global climate.",
