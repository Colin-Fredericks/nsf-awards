 "awd_abstract_narration": "This application requests partial support for the  development of an Automated DNA         Sequencing Facility.  Seven independent laboratories in the Departments of  Biochemistry, Botany, Genetics, and Zoology at the  University of Washington, for whom DNA sequencing represents  a major research focus (major users), and an additional  seven laboratories in these Departments with a significant  but less extensive need for DNA sequencing (minor users),  are participating in this proposal. The impetus for this  application derives from the realization by these  individuals that existing methods for manual sequencing of  DNA are slower, more work-intensive, and more expensive than  are automated methods that employ fluorescent compounds to  track DNA fragments. All 14 faculty members involved in this  application have concluded that the need to rely on manual  methods for DNA sequencing is having a distinctly negative  impact on the progress of their research.    The 14 projects that comprise this application are all  funded by one or more research  grants from the National Science Foundation, National  Institutes of Health, and other granting agencies. The major  projects involve: an analysis of genes required for cell  migrations during oogenesis in Drosophila (C. Berg); the  structure and function of the mammalian metaxin gene family  (P. Bornstein); a molecular analysis of marine plant systems  (R. Cattolico); large-scale sequencing of the MHC class II  region in birds (S. Edwards); comparative sequence analysis  of the two largest subunits of nuclear RNA polymerase II  from different taxa (B. Hall); regulatory analyses of muscle  creatine kinase genes (S. Hauschka); and hormonal regulation  of insect development (L. Riddiford). The minor projects  involve: characterization of the revolta gene of Arabidopsis  thaliana (L. Comai); identification of components of the  microtubule organizing center in S. cerevisiae (T. Davis);  genetic control of the yeast cell cycle (L. Hartwell);  regulation of       mesodermal patterning in Xenopus and  zebrafish (D. Kimelman); origin of polarity in Drosophila  development (H. Ruohola-Baker); heterochromatic genes and  position effects in Drosophila (B. akimoto); and evolution  of a regulatory protein and its target gene in yeast  (E.Young).    We request the purchase of a model 377 ABI Prism Automated  DNA Sequencer with  associated computer software, and a GeneAmp PCR System 9600.  These instruments will be housed in space provided by the  Department of Biochemistry. The facility will be run on a  fee-for-service basis (cost center). It is anticipated that  80-90% of the capacity of the facility will be utilized by  the participating laboratories and that the remaining  capacity will be made available to investigators at the  University of Washington on a first-come, first-served  basis.",
