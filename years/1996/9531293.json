 "awd_abstract_narration": "9531293  Shah       In recent years, curve evolution has developed into an  important tool in Computer Vision and has been applied to a wide  variety of problems such as smoothing of shapes, shape analysis  and shape recovery.  The underlying principle is the evolution of  a simple closed curve whose points move in the direction of the  normal with a prescribed velocity.  A fundamental limitation of  the method as it stands is that it cannot deal with important  image features such as triple points.  The method also requires a  choice of an \"edge-strength\" function, defined over the image  domain, indicating the likelihood of an object boundary being  present at any point in the image domain.  This implies a separate  preprocessing step that is in essence precomputing approximate  boundaries in the presence of noise.  The initial curve also has  to be preselected.  The investigator demonstrates that the  different versions of curve evolution used in Computer Vision  together with the preprocessing step and the choice of the  initial curve can be integrated in the form of a new segmentation  functional that unifies and extends curve evolution models.  Moreover, the numerical solutions obtained retain sharp  discontinuities or \"shocks,\" thus providing sharp demarcation of  object boundaries.  The new functional described provides a  unified approach to the segmentation problem and shape analysis.  The principal objective of the proposed research is to carry out  a mathematical analysis of the new functional, apply it to real  images, and study its possible extensions.       This project is in the field of machine vision, with  applications especially in medical imaging.  The underlying  mathematical theory proposed here is potentially applicable also  to seemingly unrelated fields such as liquid crystal technology,  metallurgy, flame propagation and combustion.  A computer receives  visual information through a camera in the form of millions of  numbers per picture frame, each number describing th e intensity  and the color of light at a point in the scene.  The sheer volume  of the visual information makes the task of its interpretation by  the computer extremely difficult.  The first processing task for  the computer before it can begin to recognize an object in a  scene is to find the object's outline.  This is what is called the  segmentation problem.  The fundamental difficulty here is how to  separate the object's outline from the rest of a cluttered scene.  Even when the computer has successfully located the object  outline, it is difficult to identify the object because its  appearance changes depending on its orientation as the object and  the camera move.  Worse, the object might be partially obscured.  Therefore, characteristic features that distinguish one object  from another and that remain unchanged as the appearance of the  object changes must be defined and calculated.  This is the  problem of shape analysis.  This project formulates a new unified  approach to the fundamental mathematical questions underlying the  two problems.  It develops new mathematical tools based upon this  approach and applies them to specific classes of practical  problems, in particular to analysis of biomedical images.",
