 "awd_abstract_narration": "HRD-9628573  Long Island University    \"Strengthening the Research Environment by Acquisition of a 300 MHz  NMR Spectrometer\"    Long Island University's Brooklyn Campus requests support for the  acquisition of a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer with a  superconducting magnet, operating at 300 MHz.  The University will  provide non-federal matching funds on a one to one basis.    The University is a private institution and its Brooklyn Campus has  an enrollment of 8,000 students, more than 50% of whom are  minorities underrepresented in the sciences.  This proposal is made  on behalf of the department of chemistry, which experiences  approximately 900 undergraduate and 70 graduate (master's level)  registrations per semester.  There are 41 undergraduate chemistry  majors:  14 are Black and 3 are Hispanic; 27 are women and 14 are  men.  The Molecular Biology undergraduate program (co-sponsored by  the chemistry and biology departments) has 20 undergraduate majors:  7 are Black and 2 are Hispanic; 12 are women.  The master's program  in chemistry has 16 majors: 7 are Black, 2 are Hispanic, and 12 are  women.    The acquisition of the NMR spectrometer will fill a major gap in  the otherwise adequate research and instructional equipment of the  department.  It will strengthen the research environment of the  institution and will enhance very significantly the research  capabilities of five faculty, will bring about significant  improvement in the laboratory training of those student majoring in  chemistry.    The proposed research to be performed on the instrument includes  classical organic syntheses, the development of new catalysts for  organic compound transformations and polymerizations, the  development of new materials with interesting electrical  properties, the better understanding of properties and  thermodynamics of unsaturated molecules, and the better fundamental  understanding and modeling of industrial resin manufacture.  These  projects are for the immediate future and it is  expected that the  equipment will remain in service for the next 10-15 years,  maintained by the University, will support many more research  undertakings, and will increase significantly the contribution of  this institution to the Nation's scientific research activities.  ***",
