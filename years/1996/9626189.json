While these models can sometimes be  calculated analytically, they often can only be represented by Monte Carlo  simulations, particularly when selection biases are involved in the data  collection.  In such cases, the empirical distribution does not approach the  underlying population distribution and standard parameter estimation is  inapplicable.  The investigators study an estimation procedure, based on  projections of multivariate datasets on to 1-dimensional spaces, to derive  optimal values and constraints on the hidden parameters   Kolmogorov-Smirnov-type statistics based on the projections will be used to  compare the data with models.  Asymptotic consistency and the asymptotic  distribution of the new statistics will be evaluated using approximation  theory of empirical processes.  When applied to astronomical problems,  `best-fit' model parameters may be computed even for biased multivariate  data and complicated models.  %%%      Many important problems in astronomical research involve applying  complicated astrophysical models to datasets with many variables:  the  evolution of galaxies since the Big Bang, the distribution of matter in our  Galaxy, the age of the oldest stars in globular clusters.  The astronomer  seeks insight into the validity of the models and the range of model  parameters consistent with the data.  The models are often very complex, and  real datasets frequently suffer from known selection biases (e.g. only the  brighter galaxies are detected).  We develop and apply the mathematical  and statistical tools necessary to treat such problems.  This project is part of a   long-term effort to promote intellectual integration of two disciplines:  statistics,  which has sophisticated tools for understanding data; and astronomy, which  confronts fundamental questions a bout our physical Universe.  ***",
