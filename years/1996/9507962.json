The initial objective is to synthesize, characterize, and catalytically evaluate  zeolite-based catalysts with incorporated metal ions for use in the catalytic decomposition of  NO.  The de-NOx catalytic activity then will be assessed as a function of different methods of  metal ion introduction, including impregnation, ion-exchange in aqueous solution, ion-  exchange by solid state reaction, and chemical vapor deposition.  The third objective is to  incorporate metal ions of copper, rhodium, iridium, and others into alumina-pillared hectorite  clays and to evaluate these materials for de-NOx activity.    Zeolites are aluminosilicates so bonded as to form molecular-sized cages and channels which  give rise to the term \"molecular sieves.\"  The aluminosilicate framework has a net negative  charge which is balanced by exchangeable cations.  Zeolites are used extensively for various  catalytic reactions such as cracking, hydrocracking, and isomerization.  The PI and his  Korean collaborator will investigate the effectiveness of various zeolites and smectic clays in  removing from automobile exhaust nitrogen oxides, major contributors to air pollution and  acid rain.  If successful, their zeolite-based and smectic clay-based catalysts might replace the  expensive platinum, rhodium, and palladium catalysts presently in use.  The PI and his  Korean collaborator are highly respected researchers who have made a number of significant  contributions in the field of this proposal.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the  U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation  bet ween U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific  information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual  benefit.  Korean participation in the project is supported by the Korea Science and  Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  This project adds an international cooperative dimension  to the PI's ongoing research under NSF Grant No. CHE-9420766 and provides an  international research experience to a U.S. graduate student.  ***",
