 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reconstructing and understanding past ocean circulation and heat  transport are central to establishing the causes and mechanisms of  long-term climate change.  Ocean circulation directly influences  the global environment through the formation of ice, by influencing  oceanic and atmospheric CO2, and by heat transfer.  Ice and marine  records show millennial-scale changes in temperature and  circulation during the last glacial interval, suggesting climate  instability on very short time scales.    The high-sedimentation-rate cores recovered during ODP Leg 162  provide a unique opportunity to investigate the millennial-scale  stability of climate and thermohaline circulation over the last  three million years.  This will be accomplished by examining  sedimentological parameters which are influenced by climate and  current strength and comparing them to independently generated  isotopic and faunal records.  Four different climatic regimes will  be investigated; the 100 kyr dominated late Pleistocene world with  large marine based ice-sheets, the 41 kyr dominated world during  the early Pleistocene and late Pliocene, and the mid-Pliocene warm  interval before initiation of the Northern Hemisphere ice ages.    Interactive activities focus on teaching a graduate course entitled  \"Drift Sedimentation in Modern and Ancient Oceans,\" collaborating  with scientists at Cambridge University, and giving a lecture tour  to college students in the U.S. as a U.S. Science Advisory  Committee Distinguish Lecturer.",
