 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626884  Menasco       The investigators develop a computer program for studying  topological properties of maps of punctured surfaces.  A central  component of the software tool is the Bestvina-Handel algorithm  for the Thurston-Nielsen classification of surface  homoeomorphisms, which yields not only the classification, but  also a canonical representative - a \"train-track map\" - of the  isotopy class to which the homeomorphism belongs.  Experimentation  in this field, essential to the formulation of theorems and  conjectures, is currently hampered by the very large amount of  labor entailed in classifying and analyzing even a single example  of a surface homeomorphism.  The software removes this roadblock.  It allows the researcher to rapidly generate train-track maps,  and representations and characterizations (both algebraic and  graphical) of their suspensions.  The software is made available  via the World Wide Web.       One studies dynamical systems to explain and make  predictions about a vast range of phenomena, from the motions of  the stars and planets, to the circulation of the Earth's  atmosphere, to the behavior of machinery such as drilling rigs  and human hearts, to the self-propulsion of bacteria.  In  describing such phenomena, which are repetitive in character,  models in the form of iterated maps from some space to itself  frequently have great explanatory and predictive power.  Perhaps  the simplest class of realistic models is that of continuous maps  of two-dimensional surfaces.  Even simple members of this class  can exhibit a bewildering complexity of behavior, and many  questions about these systems have yet to be answered.  Maps of  punctured surfaces are of interest because of their bearing on  the relationships among periodic orbits and on long-standing  problems of the theory of knots.  The purpose of this project is  to develop a software tool for experimentation in the topological  properties of maps of punctured surfaces.  Topological properties,  those that ar e persistent under distortions of the surface or  map, are the most fundamental.  The software is made available via  the World Wide Web.",
