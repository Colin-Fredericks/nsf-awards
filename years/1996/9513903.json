 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  ultimate  objective  of this project is to  develop  and  to  make  available   to   the   neuroscience  research  community   siliconbased  microelectrode  arrays (\"probes\") for recording  signals  from  nervous  tissue,  as  well  as  critical  supporting  equipment  for  performing  practical   multisite   neuronal  recording   experiments.   The   tiny  fork-shaped  silicon  probes have several microelectrodes  on  each  of  their  multiple shafts, and allow simultaneous recording from  multiple  neurons  at  various depths and lateral spacings. Each shaft  typically  occupies  less volume than a pair of microwire electrodes. Using  these  probes,  it  will  be possible to obtain a detailed  look  at  a  local  network of neurons.    Initial  development  of the basic technologies has  been  accomplished  with  the  support  of  a  previous grant from NSF.  Probes  have  been  manufactured  using a new microfabrication process, and neural  signals  have  been  recorded  with  them  from  the  cerebellar  cortex  of  an  anesthetized  rat.  The present grant will support efforts  to  further  develop   the  instrumentation  and  to  test  it  in  three  different  neurophysiology  laboratories. The goal of this funding  period  is  to  develop  the  technology to the point that it  can  be  distributed  to  outside users at the end of the grant, through a collaboration  with  a  commercial  ncuroscience  equipment vendor.  With  this  approach,  the  project  should have a broad and rapid impact by making  silicon  probe  experiments accessible to the neuroscience community at large.",
