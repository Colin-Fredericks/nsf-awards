 "awd_abstract_narration": "Heinzer  9622224    This proposal supports the work of Professor W. Heinzer to work  on problems in commutative algebra. He intends to study  intermediate rings between a local domain and its completion. He  also intends to study the structure of ideals in a two  dimensional regular local ring, the ramification of prime ideals  in infinite integral extensions, the contraction of ideals from  one dimensional overrings with applications to primary  decomposition in powers of ideals in Noetherian rings, and the  content of Gaussian polynomials.     This research is on the boundary between commutative algebra and  algebraic geometry. Both fields  arose from the classical problem  of studying mathematical objects defined in the plane by the  simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the fields use  methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and  topology, and conversely are extensively used in those fields.   Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse as  physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding  theory and robotics.",
