 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB-1) will  be  held January 3-6, 1996, in Hawaii. PSB-1 will bring together  top  researchers and educators, from the US,  Asian  Pacific  nations,  Europe and throughout the rest of  the  world,  to  exchange  research  results,  teaching  experiences  and  to  address open issues in all aspects of computational biology.  Replacing  and  extending  the  last  three  years  of   the  Biotechnology  Computing Track at the  Hawaii  International  Conference on System Sciences (HICSS), PSB-1 will provide  a  forum for presentation and discussion on virtually all areas  of  computational biology with special emphasis this year in  the   following  areas:  molecular  evolution,   interactive  molecular  visualization, genome informatics and  databases,  protein   structure  analysis  and  prediction,   population  modeling,   quantum/classical  hybrid  methods,   biological  control   systems,  protein  design,  internet   tools   and  biocomputing    education.    PSB-1    is    a     genuinely  interdisciplinary  meeting,  emphasizing  the  critical  and  difficult  areas in both computer science and biology,  with  in-depth  coverage of such areas as evolutionary  inference,  protein biophysics, advanced data representations, and  high  performance computing.    The Biotechnology Computing Track of HICSS in previous years  attracted  researchers from more than 20 countries.  Initial  feedback  from PSB-1 conference announcements  suggest  that  participation at the new meeting will be just as diverse. No  other    computational   biology   meeting    has    greater  international participation.    To  our  knowledge, PSB's educational workshop is the  first  ever  organized  meeting  on the teaching  of  computational  biology.  Course  and curriculum development  are  at  their  formative  stages. Many faculty are facing similar  problems  in  this  emerging and crucial area, yet there is a lack  of  published  materials and no widely available  gu idelines.  A  forum  on educational issues at this time will significantly  advance instruction in this field.    The  organizing committee is requesting funding in order to:  (i)  attract  high  caliber educators and researchers;  (ii)  attract  educators and researchers who have recently  become  involved   in   course   and   curriculum   development   in  computational  biology;  and (iii) fund  graduate  students,  postdoctoral   fellows,   young  faculty,   and   women   or  minorities,  with  preference shown to  those  who  will  be  giving oral presentations or displaying posters.",
