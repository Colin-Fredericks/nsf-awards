 "awd_abstract_narration": "9601155  Mcfall-Ngai  The goal of this research program is to define specific aspects of the complex morphological, biochemical and molecular conversation that underlies the development of the cooperative association between the sepiolid squid Euprymna scolopes and its luminous bacterial partner, Vibrio fischeri.  The present proposal draws directly from the foundation created by recent developmental studies of this model system, and focuses on four specific questions:   1. What are the characteristics of the bacteria-induced     cell death that occurs in the light organ during the     colonization process, and how do the bacteria signal     this process?   2. How is development of the accessory structures of      the light organ induced, and to what extent are the     bacteria symbionts involved in this process?   3. What are the identities of symbiosis-induced                       bacterial genes?   4. Is bacterial catalase induction essential for       symbiotic competency, and/or for the triggering of      host development?  These questions will be addressed both by examining diagnostic characteristics of embryonic and postembryonic development, and by experimentally manipulating symbiotic and aposymbiotic juvenile animals.  In addition, development of the bacterial symbionts will be probed using promoter-reporter constructs that will lead to the identification of bacterial genes that are induced specifically during symbiosis, and reveal the role(s) of these genes in host development.  Light and electron microscopy will be used in concert with in situ hybridization dn immunocytochemistry to visualize regions of host and symbiont gene expression, and the presence of resultant protein products.",
