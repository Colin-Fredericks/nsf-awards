The conference will consider the main scientific and technical findings of the Northridge earthquake research, the important conclusions reached for assessing and reducing seismic hazards posed by future events, and critical gaps in our current knowledge that need to be addressed by new research. To accelerate the dissemination and utilization of research results, a multi-volume proceedings will be compiled.  This document will provide an interdisciplinary overview of  research undertaken as part of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program's response to the most damaging of U.S. earthquakes.  Also, research summaries and other Northridge earthquake materials will be provided on the World Wide Web.",
