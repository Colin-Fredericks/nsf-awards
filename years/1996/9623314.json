 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9623314  PI:  Nagy  Kansas State University    Nagy will investigate rigidity phenomena in C*-algebraic   deformation quantization. In order to address such problems,   Nagy plans to use and develop homological techniques adequate   for the classification of certain classes of C*-algebras. One motivation   of this research is the recent worldwide interest in the promising   new theory of quantum groups which links together several branches   of mathematics and is closely related to mathematical physics.   Another motivation and inspiration for this project is the development   in the K-theory of C*-algebras in connection with non-commutative  geometry.    The area of mathematics for this project has its basis  in the theory of algebras of operators on Hilbert spaces.  The study of operator algebras was initiated in the 1930's by   John von Neumann in order to provide a mathematical framework   for quantum mechanics. Due to a broad range of applications,  operator algebras are presently one of the most dynamic fields in  mathematics. For example, the remarkable interactions of operator algebras   with knot theory, discovered by Vaughan Jones in the 1980's, lead to   interesting applications to the study of the DNA molecules. Due to their   fundamental role in non-commutative geometry, in quantum probability theory,   and in conformal quantum field theory, operator algebras   have become increasingly important in physics.",
