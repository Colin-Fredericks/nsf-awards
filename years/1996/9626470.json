 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Alexander R. Muci has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research   Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Muci received the doctoral degree from   Harvard University under the supervision of Professor David A. Evans.    Dr. Muci will continue research at the California Institute of Technology   under the sponsorship of Professor John E. Bercaw.  The postdoctoral   research will focus on the synthesis and study of enantiomerically pure   polymerization catalysts.  In particular, work includes the synthesis of   an yttrocene complex where chirality installed in the silicon linker   controls the rotational orientation of the substituted Cp rings.    Longterm research goals target the development of synthetically useful   catalytic carbon-carbon bond activation reactions.  Heterogeneous,   metal-catalyzed carbon-carbon bond cleavage is an important process for   the cracking of crude petroleum hydrocarbons into more useful, lower   molecular weight chemicals and fuels.  The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as   an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge   and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in   contemporary chemical research and teaching.",
