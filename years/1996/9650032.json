 "awd_abstract_narration": "To capitalize on the recent allocation of space for the proposed laboratory, funds were requested for research template and statistical analysis software, a local area network of microcomputers, and a classroom data projection system.  A dedicated microcomputer laboratory in Experimental Psychology 1) supports the continued development of a new Laboratory in Cognition course, 2) allows the department to maximize the impact of the administration's recent space allocation for this laboratory, and 3) centralizes  and expands laboratory resources in order to increase hands-on exposure to the scientific method in psychology in the three targeted courses, Experimental Design and Statistical Inference, Laboratory in Cognition, and Research Issues in Psychology. Establishing a dedicated microcomputer laboratory for students in these courses better prepares them for psychology careers because the current situation, a College-wide, open-use lab, is an inadequate environment for actively exploring the research design and analysis activities. Furthermore,   this project expands the research activities possible and facilitates student-directed data collection and analysis. Women, who comprise the majority of the students in these targeted courses, and minorities, who make up 30% of majors, are especially empowered by their successes in these courses. Evaluation includes both self-report and behavioral data comparing the current situation with the proposed changes. The basic premise of the proposal is that students gain a solid background in research design and statistics because they are asked to make use of such information rather than just read about it. Students become more competitive and savvy about science-oriented laboratory tools after having participated in the three courses to be offered in this dedicated laboratory.",
