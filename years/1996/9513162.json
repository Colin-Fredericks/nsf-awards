 "awd_abstract_narration": "9513162  Hsu      This is a 12 month award proposed by Dr. Tai-Ran Hsu, San  Jose State University. This proposal requests funds to  convene a Trans-Pacific workshop on education and human  resource development in mechatronic technology.  This  workshop will include educators, scientists, engineers and  business leaders in the mechatronics industry from Korea,  Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Japan.  The  meeting will be held at the San Jose State University,  California on May 19-24, 1996.  Mechatronics is an important  and emerging technology combining mechanical science with  electronics.  The U.S. has held a leadership role in this  technology, but this leadership role has been seriously  challenged in recent years by producers in Pacific-rim  countries as these countries have invested heavily in this  technology.  The result has been a dramatic shift in the  manufacturing of mechatronics products from the U.S. to  these countries.  The principal reason for the shift of this  industry to overseas is the quality and quantity of the  labor force including the cultural values of the workers.  Human resource development  therefore becomes a key factor,  in order for the U.S. labor force to be competitive in this  industry.  This workshop comes at an opportune time for  developing an agenda for education and human resource  development in U.S. colleges for training the front line of  workers in this industry.  The result can be of importance  for strengthening the U.S. competitive position in this  field.",
