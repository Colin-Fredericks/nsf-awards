Dr. Sisk will work with Dr. Hisaharu  Hayashi, on a research project entitled, \"Quenching of  Gaseous Fluorescence by Large  Magnetic Fields up to 10 T and Magnetic Field Effects on  Reactions Products After Excitation\".    Research on the chemical reaction of gas phase molecules has  previously been carried out at ordinary fields (H<2.5 T).  The proposed study will investigate the chemical reactions  of gaseous molecules with large magnetic fields (H>2.5 T).  When a molecule is excited, e.g. via laser light  application, it may relax to its intial state through the  emission of light (fluorescence).  Accordingly, the  examination of levels of fluoresence is an effective way to  monitor reactants or products of a chemical reaction.  When  a molecule is excited in the presence of a defined magnetic  field, the magnitude of the fluorescence is also altered. In  the proposed research, fluorescence quenching and time-  resolved absorbance spectro-scopy will be carried out under  the influence of different applications (the emphasis on  magentic fields) in order to: 1) gain a more comprehensive  understanding of how large magnetic fields quench  fluorescence in gasphase candidates; 2) ascertain the long-  term effects that large magnetic fields have on complicated  reaction mechanisms.  ***",
