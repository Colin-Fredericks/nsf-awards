 "awd_abstract_narration": "9531848  Landing    The western Atlantic is a good location for examining the effects  of multiple inputs, biogeochemical processes, and circulation on  the concentrations of trace elements. This study will examine the  interaction between inputs, cycling, and transport for Al, Be, Fe,  As, Se, Sb, and other trace elements in the western Atlantic.  The  cruise track provides opportunities to collect samples from nearly  all of the major intermediate and deep water masses in the  Atlantic, as well as a detailed surface transect across the western  boundary currents in the south Atlantic, the equatorial  Atlantic/ITCZ (which receives large amounts of Saharan dust), and  the Amazon plume, (supplying terrestrial organic ligands, suspended  sediments, and colloidal matter). This cruise track will also meet  the second research objective, to coordinate and execute the third  Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission Baseline Expedition for  Trace Metals and Organic Contaminants in the western South and  equatorial Atlantic. The stated goal of these expeditions, as  envisioned by the IOC, is to characterize the major water masses of  the world's oceans for as many contaminants as possible so that  changes due to anthropogenic activity can be identified.",
