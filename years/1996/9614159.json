The goals of the Center are to: 1) to advance the science base in the technologies of web handling through fundamental and generic research; 2) to assist in the transfer knowledge and information to the sponsoring organizations; 3) to assist in the transfer of knowledge and information to targeted Oklahoma manufacturing firms; and 4) to establish and maintain strong cooperative relationships with industry and other universities.    The Center currently has nineteen corporate sponsors each contributing $25,000 each year for sponsorship.  Over the ten year development the sponsors have played a key role in the evaluation of projects, the identification of new projects, and the advisement of the principal investigators.  Inputs are sought on a continuing basis from the IAB members on potential new projects.  A research needs assessment is conducted once each year.  Inputs from industry participants often form the basis of new project proposal s at subsequent meetings, as well as changes in the scope of continuing projects.",
