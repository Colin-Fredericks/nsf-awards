 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this study is to provide systematic evidence  regarding the factors that determine the choice of contracts for  land, buildings, equipment, and labor in North American  agriculture. To date, economic analysis of contracts has been  largely limited to theoretical inquiries.  Empirical work has  been done with aggregate data or small samples of contract data  and has been concentrated in developing countries, but little  work has been done using large samples of contracts from modern  agriculture.  The theoretical literature on contracts has  traditionally been dominated by principal-agent models that rely  on risk aversion to generate testable predictions.  More  recently, the transaction cost paradigm has emerged as a  theoretical alternative.  The proposed study will develop an  important data base and test economic theories of contracting,  and bridge the gap between theoretical and empirical research.    The study will test hypotheses derived from both principal-agent  models and transaction-cost models of contracts applied to North  American agriculture.  From principal-agent theory, hypotheses  include: 1) As crop yield output variability increases it is more  likely that a share contract will be chosen over a fixed payment  contract. 2) As crop output variability increases the share to  the farmer will decrease. 3) Under decreasing absolute risk  aversion share contracts will be less often used by wealthy  farmers.  From transaction and monitoring cost theory, hypotheses  include: 4) Because highly variable crops have greater monitoring  costs, as crop yield output variability increases it is less  likely that a cropshare contract will be chosen over a fixed  payment contract. 5) The choice between owning and leasing assets  will depend on enforcement costs and contract incentives.    To test these hypotheses, a large data base on individual  contracts for land, labor, buildings, and equipment in North  American agriculture will be assembled.  Data sources will  include: T he 1986 Nebraska and South Dakota Leasing Survey, The  1992 British Columbia Farmland Ownership Areal Leasing Survey,  1979 British Columbia Farming Lease Survey, and The 1992  Louisiana Farmland Ownership and Leasing Survey. Once developed  the data will include observations on over 4,000 farmland  contracts from over 2,000 farms. It is likely to be the most  extensive data set available to study the economics of contracts.",
