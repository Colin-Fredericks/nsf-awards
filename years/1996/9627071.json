 "awd_abstract_narration": "9627071  Strikwerda       The investigator improves, studies, and implements numerical  methods for parallel and distributed computation.  The project  concentrates on parallel domain decomposition methods for  incompressible viscous flow, implemented in a distributed  environment and applying the methods to problems of significant  interest.  The investigator runs a domain decomposition code in a  distributed computing environment using message passing.  The  code uses the finite difference method with the incompressible  Navier-Stokes equations to solve for flow in nonsimple  geometries.  He analyzes the solution of linear systems by  distributed relaxation methods and other methods suitable for  distributed computing environments.  He analyzes further recent  convergence results for the GMRES(m) algorithm, a very robust  method with wide applicability.  The investigator has recently  analyzed parallel computing methods and shown that synchronous  methods are faster than asynchronous methods for a significant  class of methods.  He extends this work to a wider class of  methods and use more powerful analytical methods to analyze  parallel computations.  The current code uses the PVM library to  pass boundary values between domains.       This project studies how best to solve some large numerical  problems using parallel computation.  For many of these  computations, algorithms can be devised so that the total effort  is split into several large pieces that are linked together.  For  example, determining the flow pattern of water past a submarine  can be split into the flow near the front, middle, and rear, as  well as the flow farther away from the submarine.  For these four  regions, if the solution is known in any three of the regions,  the flow in the fourth region can be determined.  This leads to  an iterative method for computing the flow: assuming that the  flow is correct in three regions, a flow in the other region can  be computed.  This resulting total flow can then be used to  com pute a new flow in each region, and this process can be  continued until it converges to the correct answer.  The  computations can be greatly speeded up if they are done for each  region simultaneously, that is in parallel.  There are a number  of issues related to this sort of computation.  The computation  can proceed in a synchronous fashion, with a new round of updates  beginning only after all have finished, or the updates could be  done asynchronously, with a new update for a region beginning as  soon as the previous update for that region is completed.  For  some problems it can be shown that the synchronous computations  are faster.  Some other iterative methods, in particular one  called GMRES, are usually faster than the simple iteration  described above.  GMRES uses past information to guide the  computation of the next update toward a better result.  The  investigator implements this in parallel and studies the gain in  efficiency that results.  One of the project's goals is to  determine how to best decompose certain large problems to better  utilize high performance computing environments.",
