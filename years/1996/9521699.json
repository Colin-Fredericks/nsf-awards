 "awd_abstract_narration": "Doctoral Dissertation Research:  Converting the Industrial Assets of Cold War Science    Under the direction of  Dr. Ann Markusen, Mr. Jonathan Feldman is examining the barriers and opportunities for conversion in firms which primarily serve the military.  The most successful defense projects are led by managers able to forge links among engineering experience, insiders and exposure to outside commercial experiences such as civilian production culture.  Defense cutbacks and supporting regimes spark diversification in these firms.  Defense procurement creates capacities for civilian market entry through economies of scope, such capacities for diversification can be extended by reorganizing resources through separatimn, the development of common systems and the creation of institutions which facilitate technology transfer among divisions.  Such institutions include systems for forging cooperation within the firm.  Successful projects which exploit these strategies benefit from learning by doing, relatedness between new products and old defense or newly acquired commercial capacities and the existence of a collaborative system which forces engineers to design for civilian needs.   The collaborative system often is linked to external users who help build markets for defense firms.  To test the hypotheses and develop a theory of the changing institutional requirements of developing defense nurtured financial, research and manufacturing capacities for civilian use, Mr. Feldman is studying a number of defense firms and case studies of defense contractors and their key civilian projects.",
