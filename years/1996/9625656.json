 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this project are to advance the state-of-the-  art in language-based tools for software engineering. There  are three related aspects to the research: (1) extending  dependence-graph-based tools, (2) carrying out theoretical  and practical studies of pointer analysis, and (3)  quantifying trade-offs in dataflow analysis.    The work builds on the prior research in two areas: the  design and implementation of software engineering tools, and  the design, implementation and evaluation of algorithms for  dataflow analysis.  The first part of the work includes the  continuation of previous NSF-supported research extending  underlying theory to permit graph-based tools to be used for  a wider range of languages than is currently possible, and  improving existing graph based tools. It also includes  new directions: the design and implementation of new tools  using a hybrid approach that combines text or syntax-based  tools with semantic checks.    The research on pointer analysis and dataflow analysis  tradeoffs is complementary to the work on dependence graphs,  since the results are expected to improve the graph-based  tools. They are also expected to be useful to other  researchers and practitioners concerned with applications  that rely on the results of static analysis.  ***",
