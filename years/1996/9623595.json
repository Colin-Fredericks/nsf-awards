 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623595  Adanur   Being able to rapidly produce aligned polymer fiber composite structures today limits their use in mid to high volume products.  This CAREER award will investigate new approaches that draw on textile manufacturing technologies to produce net shape resin impregnated composite preforms rapidly and reliably.  The educational program of course and curriculum development will complement the research program, but also build the infrastructure at Auburn University for a Textile Engineering program accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).  The research plan calls for modeling and experimental investigation of two innovative new thermoplastic composite manufacturing processes.  One process involves spreading the fibers in the yarns so that they can be more easily impregnating with resin, which is followed by returning the fibers to yarn that is made into a preform and cured.  The other process uses a new concept for resin impregnation just before braiding and weaving.  A well thought out curriculum development plan emphasizes engineered textiles as a product, but also the machines and systems needed to produce them.  A structural textile composites laboratory will complement and connect the research and education aspects of this project.   Technical breakthroughs in making near net shape composite structures will greatly reduce the cost and potential for high performance aligned fiber composites.  The educational plan will develop a new look in textile engineering curriculum that prepares textile engineers for new opportunities.",
