 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Geographic Information System laboratory will be developed to support broad applications in the Dept. of Geography and Planning, and in the associated physical, life, and social sciences.  This project also provides a number of opportunities for undergraduate students to work directly with faculty members on research projects making use of GIS or related spatial analysis techniques using state-of-the-art PCs and peripherals. The ultimate goal is to prepare students better for quality professional service and technical jobs in today's highly competitive marketplace.    In addition to improving the applied technical course offerings in geographic information systems (GIS) for students of the social and behavioral sciences, the department aims to satisfy an increasing demand for course work in GIS among students of law enforcement. Additional undergraduates from other colleges may benefit from an enhanced teaching laboratory for GIS and Spatial Analysis. Secondary instructional objectives focus on the ability to offer technical workshops for individuals in law enforcement and related public safety and service professions. Summer workshops in GIS can be held for individuals in the teaching profession wishing to increase their general knowledge of this rapidly changing spatial information technology and, perhaps, for recertification requirements as teaching standards change in light of new Federal and state laws. Service objectives include the potential use of GIS technology for outside applied studies in cooperation with city, county, or state agencies, which may also actively involve undergraduate students. A number of ongoing and potential service/research projects have been identified where a strong level of support for an expanded GIS laboratory is indicated.",
