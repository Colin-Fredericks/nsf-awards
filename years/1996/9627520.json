 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Biosciences Related to the  Environment for 1996.    The fellowship supports research and training in the area of  prokaryotic genetics.  The title of the research and  training plan is \"Identification of genes involved in  environmental and physiological stress resistance of  Pseudomonas fluorescens.\"    Soil bacteria grown to stationary phase in culture are more  tolerant to environmental and physiological stresses than  are exponentially-growing cells.  Sigma factor serves as a  central regulator of stationary-phase gene expression in E.  coli.  This study focuses on Pseudomonas fluorescens in  which a gene coding for sigma has recently been cloned.  Genes preferentially expressed by P. fluorescens in  stationary phase will be identified.  These studies will  expand the current knowledge of genetic factors involved in  bacterial stress response and contribute to our  understanding of the molecular basis of interactions between  a soil bacterium and its physical environment.",
