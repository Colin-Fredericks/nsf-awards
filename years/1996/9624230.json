 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  research addresses two related problems in the design and management   in integrated high-speed communication networks. The first problem is to   analyze and develop the tools required to support and operate hierarchical   source routing algorithms currently under consideration for private and   future public ATM networks. This approach to routing aims to simplify the   operation of large-scale networks by introducing hierarchical structure and   attempts to ensure Quality of Service (QoS), prior to transmitting   connection requests, via source routing. Using a combination of stochastic   modeling and optimization techniques the principle investigator will study   various approaches to estimating, and periodically advertising available   capacity, as well as to hierarchically aggregating state information. The   second problem to be investigated concerns the design of performance   oriented embedded (virtual) networks on an ATM backbone. For specific types   of services, such as interactive video, the PI will explore various   architectures and complementary management schemes which meet overall   performance requirements and maximize throughput/revenue. This work will be   extended to address, services requiring heterogeneous resource bundles such   as on-line services, distributed computing, and database applications   requiring consistent high-levels of performance and for which the use of a   dedicated virtual network is justified.",
