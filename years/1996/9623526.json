 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623526  Pruett-Jones    While most birds breed and raise young in pairs, a few species do so in groups, with several non-breeding adults assisting in the feeding and rearing of young produced by a single breeding pair.  In essence, these helpers forgo breeding themselves in order to assist the breeding pair.  In some instances, it appears that the helping birds are not related to the young that they are rearing, making cooperative breeding an apparently altruistic behavior, a situation that is rare in nature.   Research funded by this award will address the environmental factors that have promoted the evolution of this unique behavior. Studies will focus on Australian songbirds of the  Honeyeater  group. Honeyeaters are ideal for such research because they vary widely in diet, habitat preferences and in the level of cooperation in their breeding efforts.  Comparative analyses of the relationships between  environmental variables and the occurrence of cooperative breeding within the Honeyeaters will be conducted. These analyses will utilize a framework of evolutionary relationships between the species, so that behavioral characteristics that have arisen in response to similar environmental pressures can be distinguished from those arising from shared ancestry.    This study will be the first to rigorously test ecological hypotheses for the evolution of cooperative breeding.  Understanding the ecological factors promoting cooperative breeding in songbirds has implications for the conservation of avian biodiversity and for the design of managed breeding programs (e.g., in Zoological Gardens) to preserve species that show such complex social behaviors.",
