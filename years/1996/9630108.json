In addition,  plant cell vacuoles have other functions; they function in  regulating cytosolic pH, osmotic shock, and in the storage  of proteins. Plant vacuole can occupy up to 90% of the total  cellular volume. The maintenance of vacuoles requires the  specific sorting of proteins and lipids from their sites of  synthesis to the vacuoles. The process of recognition,  sorting, and transport of proteins to the vacuole is  complex. More than 30 genes have been implicated in vacuolar  protein sorting. The goal of the proposed research is to  determine the role of a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-  kinase) and that of a serine/threonine protein kinase in  protein sorting to plant cell vacuole. The specific  objectives are to study 1) the role of Vps 34p PI 3-kinase  activity in protein sorting to plant vacuoles in Arabidopsis  thaliana; 2) the role of Vsp 15p, a protein kinase, in  protein sorting to plant vacuole in A. thaliana. The gene  for Vps 15p will be cloned and sequence. Cloning of the gene  will be done by functional complementation of a Vps 15p  yeast mutant by transforming with an A. thaliana cDNA  library, or by PCR-based amplification of gene fragments  that will be used to probe the cDNA library to identify the  gene. The role of Vps 15p and of Vps 34p will be assessed in  A. thaliana by examining tissue and temporal gene expression  patterns in wild type plants, and by documenting the effects  of overexpressing the gene in transgenic plants. It is  expected that this data will provide new insights into how  protein transport is regulated in plants.  %%%  The plant cell vacuole is functionally similar to fungi  vacuoles and to lysosome of mammalian cells.
