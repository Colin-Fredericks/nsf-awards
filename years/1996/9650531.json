 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on enhancing undergraduate materials engineering education in the area of the mechanical behavior of structural materials. An innovative methodology is being presented, in which students perform experiments to measure key mechanical properties on a range of materials (Testing), use materials selection charts to compare the properties measured with those of other materials (Comparison), and then use this information to get at the fundamental concepts behind the properties at hand (Origin). The T-C-O approach uses both laboratory and lecture to promote true learning in the mechanical behavior of materials. A state-of-the-art tensile testing system is also being used in this project. This system, of appropriate size and capability for undergraduate use, is the cornerstone of the mechanical behavior of materials laboratory facility. Several sets of T-C-O experiments are presented at the sophomore through senior level for materials engineers and other engineering disciplines where students can use the new tensile testing system, plus other mechanical testing equipment, to discover the nature of the mechanical behavior of materials.   The T-C-O method is being evaluated by student surveys at several levels and by Beta Testing at San Jose State University and the University of California, Davis. Successful results can be disseminated to the materials and mechanics communities at the Beta Test sites, by presentation at a national technical meeting, and by publication in a refereed technical journal.",
