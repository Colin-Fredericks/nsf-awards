 "awd_abstract_narration": "9527244  Roesler         This project is a three-year study of what happens to  solar energy at the interface between the antarctic sea ice  and the atmosphere, specifically how the energy is  apportioned among the ocean, the ice, and the lowest air  layers.  It will be carried out in cooperation with the  Australian Antarctic Program, with field work on board the  Australian ship Aurora Australis.       The very high reflectivity of the seasonal antarctic  sea ice cover reduces the input of solar energy at the  surface, and the low thermal conductivity of the ice  reduces the loss of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere,  significantly affecting the climate of the Southern Ocean.  Information about how these processes work is needed in  order to develop appropriate and realistic sea ice models,  and to integrate these into general circulation and climate  change models.       Three topics will be investigated:  the distribution  and types of snow and ice cover and their reflectance in  the solar spectrum, the effect of clouds in transmitting  incident solar radiation, and the distribution and  absorption properties of organic material within the snow  and ice.       Calibrated downward and reflected upward irradiance  observations will be used to infer the radiation balance at  the surface and will be used to model the surface energy  forcing for the antarctic sea ice region.  The  concentration and distribution of major organic absorbers  will be determined from core samples within the ice, and  their effect on the transmittance of energy within the  visible and ultraviolet bands will be studied.  Algal  layers are frequently found within the antarctic sea ice,  and have been proposed as a likely mechanism for initiating  seasonal plankton blooms in the Southern Ocean.  ***",
