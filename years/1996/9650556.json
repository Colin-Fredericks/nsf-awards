 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to introduce the field of surface chemistry to undergraduate students using the technique of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). In order to accomplish this goal, faculty are developing a sequence of three experiments for the physical chemistry laboratory course that will introduce the students to surface structure and dynamics. Although a number of different experiments will be evaluated for use in the undergraduate laboratory, a possible set of experiments could be as follows:  1. Analyze the highly oriented pyrolitic graphite surface in air.  2. Compare the graphite surface in air and in water.  3. Analyze the electrochemical deposition of a metal on the graphite surface by correlating the rate or amount of deposition and the change in the surface structure.   Surface chemistry is an important branch of physical chemistry that is generally not included in undergraduate courses. Although most surface analytical equipment is expensive and difficult to use, the STM method is relatively simple. Most importantly, the capability of the STM method to image surfaces in air and liquids allows experiments on surfaces to be accomplished without the added complication of ultra-high vacuum equipment. Therefore, it is an ideal tool for an undergraduate teaching laboratory. The new equipment can also be used for undergraduate research projects.",
