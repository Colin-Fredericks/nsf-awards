 "awd_abstract_narration": "9633045  Jackson    There exist a multitude of theories which seek to answer the question:  Why do people commit crime?  The most prominent theories can be categorized under three headings: control theory, socialization/learning theory, and stress (anomie) theory.  This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement research seeks to conduct a secondary analysis of data to test Gottfredson and Hirschi's 1990 theory of criminal behavior.  In particular this research will test Gottfredson and Hirschi's assertions that (1) self-control, combined with opportunity, is the main independent cause of crime and delinquency, and (2) the major competing theories of crime--control, socialization/learning, and stress--have erroneously concluded that certain social variables (i.e., social bonds to family and school, association with delinquent peer groups, unemployment or social class, and dropping out of high school) are the independent causes of crime and delinquency when in fact they are actually the result of low self-control, and thus, are only correlated with crime.  This research will conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis of the Youth and Transition data set to test each of the three major theories of crime, introducing self-control as an independent variable.  If Gottfredson and Hirschi's prediction is correct, then the explanatory power of competing theoretical models should be reduced or eliminated entirely.  These results would suggest that self-control combined with opportunity is a significant predictor of crime and various other correlates of crime.  ***  ??",
