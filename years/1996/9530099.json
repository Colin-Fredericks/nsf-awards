The objectives to be achieved include establishing a research network among MERCOSUR participants in collaboration with North American scientists attempting to solve questions related to the effects of global change on temperate agricultural systems and its socioeconomic consequences; to promote a common systems research methodology; to define the capabilities of each country to develop the research program proposed; and to propose an integrated project employing a systems approach for studying global change and ENSO effects on temperate agricultural systems, for comparing these effects across hemispheres in the light of management and climate contrasts, for assessing the socioeconomic consequences and the feasibility of actions leading to adaptation or mitigation, and to promote the capabilities of the MERCOSUR Research Center to develop and/or generate models for solving regional issues.     To achieve the above mentioned objectives, the PI will hold two workshops and two meetings in order to complete the proposal's final product of an IAI Phase II proposal.  The IAI Phase II proposal is to create a project on the adaptation and mitigation of temperate agricultural systems to global change impacts within the contact of creating an IAI research center (RC) within the IAI research network.  Scientists from Argentina, Brazil, Canada, United States, and Uruguay will be involved in both Phase I and Phase II.     This workshop will facilitate the preparation of a proposal for the IAI Phase II proposal with the objective of coordinating projects on the adaptation and mitigation of temperate agricultural systems to global change impacts within the context of creating a research center within the IAI network at the Instituto Nacional de Te cnolog a Agopecuaria (INTA) and the National Research Center on Natural Resources (CIRN), both of which are located in Argentina.  INTA is an institution devoted to research and extension of technologies addressed to the agricultural sector. The CIRN's principal objective is the study of conservation, evolution and transformation of natural resources.  Scientists from Argentina, Brazil, Canada, United States, and Uruguay will be involved for the workshop of this proposal and for the project planned for the IAI Phase II.     This cooperative effort between North and South American scientists will allow improved insights into the functioning of temperate agroecosystems and the impact upon them of global change arising from comparative analyses.  The use of common methodologies will be promoted as well as exchange of soil, climate, experimental and satellite data between the cooperative countries in the Phase II project.  The results of Phase II will be made available in reports for policy makers.  The participating countries, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, United States, and Uruguay, are Member States of the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI), a U.S. initiative to stimulate cooperative research on global change issues among the scientific institutions of the Americas.  The National Science Foundation is the U.S. Government agency designated to carry out U.S. responsibilities within the IAI.    ***",
