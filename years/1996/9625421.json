 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues the development and implementation of new  powerful symbolic algorithms for testing the integrability and  the calculation of conservation laws.  The construction of closed-  form solutions for systems of nonlinear partial differential  equations (PDEs) will also be investigated.    In particular, for systems of nonlinear evolution equations, a  first symbolic software package will automatically generate  polynomial-type conservation laws. Based on scaling properties  (symmetries) of the equations, the proposed algorithm provides an  elegant way to construct conserved densities and their associated  fluxes.    Based on homogenization techniques, a second software package  will allow the user to compute the analytic form of particular  solutions for large classes of PDEs. For integrable equations,  the technique leads to soliton solutions. For non-integrable  equations, closed-form expressions of homoclinic and heteroclinic  orbits can be computed efficiently with the method.    The symbolic software to be developed will complement and build  on earlier algorithms for the computation of Lie-point and non-  classical symmetries, to find soliton solutions via Hirota's  direct method, and to test the integrability of differential  equations via the Painleve test.    The programs will be written in Macsyma and Mathematica syntax.  They will be entirely symbolic and produce analytical output.  The development of novel mathematical techniques, in addition to  the refinement and generalization of existing methods and  algorithms, is also a part of this research project.    The aim is to provide high-quality symbolic packages to  researchers working on soliton theory, dynamical systems,  mathematical physics; specifically nonlinear wave phenomena in  networks, elastic media, chemical kinetics, bio-sciences, fluid  dynamics, plasma physics,  and nonlinear optics.  ***",
