 "awd_abstract_narration": "A `Research Experiences for Undergraduates` Site will be  initiated at Oregon State University.  Through a national  recruitment process, 8 undergraduate students will be  selected to be involved in a 10-week summer research program  in physics.  Fields of physics to be emphasized include AMO,  computational, solid state, and nuclear.  Students will be  housed together in campus dormitories.  Each REU student  will work in a close mentoring relationship with one of the  faculty in their research labs.  In addition to the research  experience, the participants will complete a special short  summer course in interfacing computers to laboratory  devices, a skill that is essential in many research  programs, and they will also receive instruction in machine  shop techniques.  An informal `physics literary club` will  meet weekly and will feature discussion of works of  literature that have a significant physics content.  A final  `mini-conference` will give the students an opportunity to  describe their research to their colleagues and to the  faculty and students of the Physics Department.  The program  will be evaluated through written surveys as well as through  oral interviews.",
