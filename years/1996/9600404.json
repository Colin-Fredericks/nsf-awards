Dr. Richey  will work with Dr. Yoshito Ikada, Professor at the Research  Center of Biomedical  Engineering, on a research project  entitled, \"Prevention of Intimal Hyperplasia by Controlled  Release of Cyclosporine.\"    The proposed research will examine techniques to reduce  intimal hyperplasia in vein grafts using a controlled  release device containing cyclosporine, an immunosuppressant  drug.  A major chronic complication of vein grafts used for  heart bypass surgery involves the continued thickening of  the vessel wall, termed intimal hyperplasia, that decreases  blood flow and can eventually lead to graft occlusion.  The  specific causes of intimal hyperplasia are poorly  understood, but likely involve a combination of hemodynamic,  growth and immunological factors.  During the project, a  controlled release device will administer the required  amount of cyclosporine at the implant site, the intention  being to reduce or check the harmful side effects of  the  aformentioned factors.  As a further step, biodegradable  films will be prepared from polyesters using a solvent  casting technique, and the release rate and physical state  of the incorporated drugs will be determined.  Long term  improvement of bypass graft techniques using a controlled  release device would be immediately beneficial to patients  and the health care industry alike, with the facilities at  Kyoto University offering a unique combination of technology  and equipment required for this project.  ***",
