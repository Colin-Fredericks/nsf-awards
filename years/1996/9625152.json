 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research proposes to develop techniques for concurrent optimization of both  the circuit cell libraries and the fabrication process.  A key advantage of the  proposed approach is that it allows both the circuit designer and fabrication  process engineer to work towards the common goal of maximizing yield, which will  in turn reduce product cost.  A second advantage is that through concurrent  engineering, this approach can significantly reduce product development time.   Provisions have been made for validating proposed techniques in an industrial  setting.  The research component of this proposal is also complemented by an  extensive education plan for integrating studies in concurrent design into the  undergraduate curriculum.",
