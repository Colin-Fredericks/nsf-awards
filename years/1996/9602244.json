 "awd_abstract_narration": "9602244  This award renews support for a Research Training Group in  Ecological and Social Science Challenges of Conservation  first established at Cornell University in 1991.  During the  period of this renewal award, support by NSF will be phased  out as other sources of funding are secured.  The faculty  group is a mixture of 21 senior and junior investigators who  come from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds, but share a  common interest in the ecological, economic and social  aspects of conservation.  During the initial award, the  program developed new on-campus and field-based training  activities, including a graduate minor in conservation and  sustainable development.  These will continue during the  renewal period.  The funds awarded will provide stipends for  a postdoctoral student and for graduate students, will  defray part of the cost of  needed technical and  administrative assistance, and will help support an annual  field praticum in Central America that is a cornerstone of  the program.  One of the serious problems for conservation efforts is the  recurring cycle of poverty and environmental degradation  found in many regions of the world.  Common elements of the  cycle are population expansion which stimulates agricultural  expansion onto marginal lands, expanded fuelwood  requirements, and consequent soil degradation and species  extinction.  This training program will focus on two  contrasting socioecological settings in the Dominican  Republic and Costa Rica and will make use of existing  institutional arrangements and research activities.  These  activities examine demography and population growth, the  interaction of natural and agricultural systems, soil  conservation, education and management in biosphere  reserves, and related ecology studies.",
