 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622399    Compaction grouting is the injection under high pressure of  stiff  cement-based grout into soil.  There is existing and clear  evidence that  the technique works as a method to halt or reverse the  effects of ground  settlement, and to modify and improve characteristics of  existing soils and  in situ stress conditions.  The application is  overwhelmingly in the hands  of specialized consultants and contractors, but even among  them, questions  persist about the details of soil and grout mechanics.    This project will answer questions on the interrelationship  between  injection depth, grout pressure, grout mix, soil conditions  and in situ  stress, and the resulting effects on soil compaction, shear  deformation,  and soil displacement.  Preliminary centrifuge indicates  that this test  technique with small, 1-g models can demonstrate general  mechanisms of  behavior.  However, stress-correct centrifuge models are  necessary to  develop reliable representation of full-scale field  response.  There is a  commitment in this work for cooperative interaction with on-  going  NSF-sponsored research on FEM modeling and full-scale field  testing of  grout injection at North Carolina State University, and with  the U.S. Army  Corps' Waterways Experiment Station.  The centrifuge models  completed for  this award will be highly complimentary to address questions  relating to  the design of grout and injection schemes, including  variable parameters  such as injection depth, pressure, grout injection angle,  and surface  surcharge.  Commitment has also been made by grouting  contractors to advise  on this project, and plans are included for practical  training of  researcher teams.  ***",
