 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project As A Component Of A Comprehensive Plan:  The Comprehensive  Partnerships for Minority Student Achievement (CPMSA) Project has  been designed to complement the extensive reform efforts in place  throughout the school district and state.  It reflects the  objectives of federal and state Goals 2000 initiatives.  Through a  new restructuring plan within the school system that encompasses  \"clusters\" of school communities, direct services will be provided  that reflect the needs of each community and include parents and  school improvement teams as part of the decision-making process.      A Structure Designed To Deliver Excellence:  The new Superintendent  of Schools, Dr. Jerome Clark, has implemented a restructuring plan  that affects how the school system operates across every department  and division.  The new organization, \"Communities Committed to  Children,\" provides the infrastructure for a natural pipeline for  students in science and mathematics K-12, with a goal of  significantly increasing the number of African American students  graduating from the school district prepared to pursue careers or  advanced studies in science, mathematics, engineering, and  technology (SMET).  Communities Committed to Children consists of  20 school communities or clusters that take ownership for the  schooling of thousands of students enrolled in a feeder pattern of  elementary, middle, and high schools.  Each cluster is directed by  a Chief Educational Administrator (CEA) who is responsible for  ensuring the quality of programming, K-12. Each cluster also  includes a designated school, or Oasis Site, which provides  instructional and support services after school hours and during  weekends to students, parents, and the general community.  It is  within this framework, a framework designed for success, that the  components of the Comprehensive Partnerships for Minority Student  Achievement (CPMSA) proposal would be implemented.    A Program Designed To Achieve Excellence:  Communities Committed to   Children works to achieve its goals of increasing the number of  students from underrepresented populations who leave the school  district prepared to pursue careers or advanced studies in SMET  courses.  A number of coordinated, comprehensive, and innovative  strategies and partnerships are offered through this CPMSA project  to attain this goal.    Extent Of Need For The Project:  The Board of Education of Prince  George's County is a multiculturally diverse school system in  Maryland, located east of Washington, D.C., and serves 120,000  students.  This large school system mirrors many of its urban  counterparts in racial gender, and ethnic composition, as well as  size.  A number of initiatives have been implemented, and while the  performance gap in the school system between African American and  Caucasian students has been narrowed dramatically it has not been  eliminated.  The diversity of the school system reinforces the need  for attention to systemwide reform by: (1) increasing numbers of  students in science and math classes, (2) increasing student  academic performance, (3) improving career and technical education  training opportunities, and (4) enhancing staff development.  This  project strives to improve learning and teaching by providing a  framework for educational reform and accountability.  It promotes  research, consensus building, and systemic changes needed to ensure  equitable educational opportunities for all students, especially  students who are economically disadvantaged, limited English  proficient, and/or multiculturally diverse.  ***",
