The CD4 glycoprotein interacts with the same MHC class II molecule as the  antigen specific T cell receptor, and regulates intrathymic T cell  selection and activation of mature T cells.  The contribution of the  interaction between CD4 and MHC class II molecules to intracellular signal  transduction via the antigen specific T cell receptor (TCR) is not known,  however the engagement of CD4 by MHC class II molecules contributes  quantitatively and qualitatively to the activation of T cells.  This  project will test the hypothesis that antigen specific T cell receptor  mediated signal transduction depends on the structured and sequential  oligomerization of TCR, CD4 and MHC class II molecules.  The PI has  developed assays that measure adhesion of CD4+ T cells to MHC class II  cells and to purified MHC class II molecules.  Binding data will be  correlated with antigen induced T cell responses.  Mutations have been  introduced into MHC class II molecules to define regions that mediate the  interaction with CD4.  Mutant MHC class II molecules will be combined with  CD4 molecules having mutations in identified MHC class II binding regions  to define the interface formed by interacting CD4 and MHC class II molecules.  Results from these experiments will enhance our understanding of structure-  function relationships responsible for important immune regulatory mechanisms.    ***",
