 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS-9529455    This is a cooperative research effort between the University of California at Davis and the Ford Motor Company.  It is an investigation of a new class of supported metal catalyst consisting of a noble metal (platinum or palladium) bonded to an oxide support (magnesia, alumina, or silica) by means of a strong interaction with an oxophilic metal (chromium, molybdenum, or tungsten).  The intent is to maintain high dispersion in clusters smaller than one nanometer.  The catalysts are prepared from organmetallic clusters in which the noble and oxophilic metals are bonded to each other.  The supported bimetallic structures are characterized structurally and used to catalyze a series of test reactions including   n-hexane dehydrocyclization, 3-methyl-2-butenal hydrogenation, and selective nitric oxide reduction.  A practical goal is the establishment of stability limits for these catalysts with respect to temperature and composition of the reactant gas stream, and to ultimately lay down a foundation for the rational design of supported bimetallic catalysts.    Bimetallic catalysts are used in a number of very demanding industrial and environmental applications including liquid fuels production, synthesis gas conversion, and automotive exhaust control.  This effort lays the groundwork for a new generation of catalysts with better selectivity and longer life.",
