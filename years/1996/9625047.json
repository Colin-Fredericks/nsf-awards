 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625047  Katz  This is an award to support research to be conducted by this  investigator on factors that influence the movement and fate of  metal ion contaminants of surface and groundwaters.  The research  she will conduct addresses environmental problems associated with  energy and raw material production and past management practices  that require reliable quantitative prediction of the effect these  potential contaminants have on water resources.  Her research was  previously supported under a Research Initiation Award, NSF Grant  No. BCS 92-10869.  The expected results of this research include  formulation and evaluation of predictive models for contaminant  transport that can be used in engineering design of systems to  prevent, reduce or eliminate the pollutional effect metal ions have  on water resources.  The proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to NSF  95-118, Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program  Guidelines for Submission of Proposals.  As such, it not only  addressed the proposed research but related the investigator's  career development plan to the current state of knowledge in the  field and of the potential impact work supported under this award  would result in educational innovation to the current state of  knowledge on effective teaching and learning in the investigator's  discipline.",
