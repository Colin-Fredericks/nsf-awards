Nuclear genes that regulate translation of chloroplast mRNAs are being isolated and characterized.  These genes have been tagged by insertional mutagenesis in the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.  Nuclear genes and gene products required for the translation of the pbsA mRNA, which encodes the light regulated D1 protein of the photosystem II reaction center, are being identified.  These genes are being cloned and their protein products characterized.  From this analysis it should be possible to identify proteins that function in all aspects of translation of chloroplast mRNAs.  This would include translation initiation factors, elongation factors, and even signal transduction proteins.  The approach is a genetic one and makes no assumptions about what type of proteins might be identified.  It is expected that some of these genes may encode proteins that directly interact with the 5' untranslated region of the messenger RNA, which are being studied under another grant.  Formation of the chloroplast and its ability to photosynthesize is dependent upon developmental and environmental signals, and requires close cooperation of the genomes of the chloroplast and nucleus.  This research is expected to make an important contribution to our understanding of the regulation of the genes involved in photosynthesis, a process used by plants to utilize energy from light.  ***",
