 "awd_abstract_narration": "9555665  Sanders  The Teacher Education Equity Project is a collaboration of 61  teacher educators at 38  colleges and universities in 26 states working together to remedy  the lack of attention  to gender equity in the preparation of future mathematics, science  and technology  teachers. Each of seven major teacher preparation universities will  form a team  consisting of the education dean or department chair and  professors, and field  placement school principals and teachers. The teams will look at  the need for gender  equity instruction in their programs and develop action plans to  improve their  programs.  Professors who are knowledgeable about mathematics,  science and/or  technology education as well as gender equity will act as mentors  to the teams.  Teams will attend a seminar about institutional change to extend  their knowledge and  enable them to have gender equity impact on entire schools,  departments of  education, and field placement schools with which they work. An  electronic list will  permit project participants to exchange innovative ideas and  teaching practices.  Six  national professional associations will collaborate with the  mentors by providing them  with opportunities and venues to work with additional teacher  education programs  toward the end of the project and in the future.    Over 7,000 student teachers will learn about equity in mathematics,  science, and  technology teaching in new courses developed by university teams.   Advisors from  universities that have changed their teacher training courses will  help others modify  and improve the way they teach the teachers.  The benefit will  include an improved  classroom climate for all children and an increase in the number of  girls in science and  upper level math courses.  ***",
