 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500503  Rogers   Fungi, even those with conspicuous fruiting bodies (spore-producing structures), remain poorly known, especially from tropical parts of the world.  Dr. Jack Rogers of Washington State University continues to pursue studies of ascomycete fungi of the family Xylariaceae, a group of ca. 37 genera and hundreds of species distributed worldwide.  These include species of wood-rotting forms, some that are plant pathogens, and some that live internally in plants but without known destructive effects (known as fungal endophytes).  With the help of colleagues in Europe and in Latin America, Dr. Rogers is collecting new specimens of the fungi, and where possible culturing these in the laboratory in order to determine complete life cycle stages that link anamorphic (asexual, conidial) forms with teleomorphic (sexual) stages.  Mating tests in the laboratory also help to determine the boundaries between closely related species, and provide preliminary genetic data on incompatibility reactions.   The taxonomic revisionary and inventory research on Xylariaceae fungi represents a productive extension of Dr. Rogers' long-term studies of poorly known ascomycetes.  This early or \"alpha\" taxonomic stage of research focuses on the study of morphological characters and life histories, in order to determine reliable features that can be used to discriminate among closely similar species.  The foundational knowledge thus acquired will eventually permit analysis of phylogenetic or genealogical relationships among these taxa, and their biogeographical histories and ecological interactions.",
