 "awd_abstract_narration": "9508728  DeLaune  The objective of this project is to obtain a better understanding  than now exists of the conditions that result in the production  of volatile sulfur and phosphorus-containing compounds during  domestic wastewater treatment processes and in the processing of  sludges derived from the treatment of wastewaters.  Sulfurous  compounds that are produced during wastewater treatment include  hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl sulfide, methanethiol, dimethyl  sulfide and carbon disulfide.  Phosphorus compounds that are  produced during wastewater treatment may also include phosphine,  a substance of special pollutional significance because of its  toxicity, carcinogenicity and mutagenicity.    Results of this research are expected to provide knowledge that  can be applied in the operation of existing wastewater treatment  plants to reduce or eliminate the production of air pollutants.  The knowledge gained through this research is also expected to be  utilized in improving engineering design of treatment plants to  minimize or avoid the production of air pollutants of toxic  and/or nuisance significance.***",
