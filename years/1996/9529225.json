 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST  95-29225  PI:  Lev Kofman    Inflation and the Origin of Matter in the Universe         According to inflationary cosmology, all the elementary  particles which we see now were not present at the moment of  the Big Bang, but were created by the decaying scalar field  at the end of the inflationary stage. The process of  creation of matter during the decay of the scalar field and  the subsequent process of thermalization of the created  particles is called reheating. The theory of reheating is  still incomplete, and is interrelated with the dark matter  problem. Recent studies by the PI and his colleagues have  discovered more efficient methods of reheating which have  important implications for cosmological models. For example,  standard inflation theory results in a flat universe (Omega  = 1); with different reheating parameters, a different  distribution of density fluctuations may result, with a  different amount of dark matter. Since current observations  produce densities well below those of a flat universe, the  amount of dark matter can be critical in establishing  whether inflation theory does indeed hold. The PI intends to  investigate the production of elementary particles when the  new reheating methods are allowed for, and to examine the  influence of the cosmological constant on the models with  the new reheating methods, using an analytic approach.",
