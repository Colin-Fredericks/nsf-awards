 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funding to develop a series of experiments for a required undergraduate laboratory offered to students in the department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering at the University of Arizona. Specifically, these experiments will be of both a bench-scale and a \"unit          operations\" type, and will provide ChE students experience in dealing with environmental problems from a process orientation. These experiments will impact two undergraduate courses which are required for a BS ChE degree. Affected will be the Science Lab, ChEE 307 and the Unit Operations  Lab, ChEE 304.     The two basic areas in which new experiments are proposed are \"Bioremediation\" and \"Air Pollution Control\". Within the bioremediation area, we propose to purchase ancillary equipment for our current Bioprocessing Facility, as well as equipment to establish five fermentation lab-stations. With these experiments, we hope to emphasize the biological aspects of environmental engineering, while at the same time introducing students to basic principles of biotechnology. Within the Air Pollution Control area, we propose to purchase ancillary equipment for improving current gas absorption experiments in the ChEE 304 lab (directing this experiment towards an environmental application), and equipment to initiate a detailed combustion experiment, also for use in the ChE Unit Operations Labs.",
