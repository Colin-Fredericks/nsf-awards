 "awd_abstract_narration": "A monthly series of interactive satellite teleconferences is  delivered to faculty who teach undergraduate engineering students.  Each telecast features an innovative \"best practice\" which can be  adopted/adapted by participants. The 1996 DUE National Engineering  Faculty Forum builds on a successful first year of eight  teleconferences which focused on undergraduate engineering  education. A total of 1299 colleges and universities and 8,932  individuals participated in the first six of the 1995 series, the  average number of institutions was 157 with a reported average  attendance of 1,489 per seminar.      The use of the WWW and Internet to support the Faculty Forum Series  has grown significantly. The Web server now contains advance  information describing upcoming seminars as well as retrospective  data to enable faculty to order videotapes of prior seminars.  Presenters solicit input via e-mail prior to broadcast and  encourage electronic dialog after their presentation. In 1996, NTU  is building on this broad acceptance to provide for electronic  registration. FAX transmission and on-line evaluation. The campaign  to encourage attendance by instructors at transfer institutions and  community colleges is increasing.    NTU works with the NSF/DUE Program Directors to identify topics and  presenters.  NTU is producing, marketing, delivering and evaluating  seven one-hour, interactive teleconferences in 1996, which are  provided to faculty participants without charge. A license to copy  and reuse videotapes of the Teleconferences as well as the printed  material provided to each registered college/university is integral  to this cost-effective project.",
