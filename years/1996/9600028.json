Lackritz  Purdue University      Funds are requested for travel support of overseas and academic speakers in the symposium entitled \"Polymeric Thin Films for Photonic Applications\" to be held at the National ACS meeting, Orlando, Florida, August 25-30, 1996 under the Division of Polymer Chemistry (Poly) and the Division of Polymeric Materials:  Science & Engineering (PMSE), of the American Chemical Society (ACS).  The optical Society of America (OSA) is cosponsoring this symposium.    The principle objective in organizing this symposiums to promulgate the science of nonlinear optical polymers (NLOP) which has emerged as an important and exciting area for research.  This symposium is designed to bring together chemists and optical scientists to discuss polymer science capabilities and photonic device requirements so that their combined efforts will to lead to new advances.  We will have scheduled detailed tutorials on Sunday, August 25, to introduce NLO theory, optical characterization techniques, physics of glassy polymers, thin films waveguide fabrication, and promising applications, which will provide the researchers with a solid basis from which they may direct their research programs.",
