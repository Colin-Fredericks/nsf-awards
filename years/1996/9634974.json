 "awd_abstract_narration": "9634974  McCulloch  The heart is a complex three-dimensional muscular organ in which  electrical signals trigger coordinated muscle contraction to  produce the pumping action.  Not only does the electrical system  of the heart affect its mechanical pumping, but mechanics also  affect the electrical system.  The cause of these interactions  has been studied in great detail at the level of the individual  heart muscle cell.  But understanding how these cellular  properties affect the performance of the whole heart is made  extremely difficult by the complex anatomy and structure of the  heart wall.  Such an understanding is essential if the new  findings of cellular biological science are to be applied to the  prevention and diagnosis of cardiac disease and the treatment of  heart patients.  Therefore, the objective of this research is to  develop anatomically accurate computer models of the heart that  are based soundly on the underlying physics and biology of the  heart cells.  To test these models, accurate measurements in  careful experiments will be conducted.    Building on our work over the past five years, we will conduct  sophisticated new computer models of the heart using methods of  analysis similar to those used in the automotive and aerospace  industries.  Our methods have been specialized to handle the  unique complexities of cardiac biology.  The models vi II be  based on detailed new measurements of the shape and structure,  mechanical, electrical and cellular properties of the heart wall.  Because these models will be extremely demanding to even the  fastest computers, we will run them on supercomputers at the San  Diego Supercomputer Center.  The completed computer models will  be used to investigate unanswered questions about how the  electromechanical properties of individual heart cells affect the  performance of the whole heart.    To test the reliability and accuracy of the computer models, new  experimental methods will be developed for simultaneously  studying electrical  and mechanical properties in the heart.  These measurements will be used to improve the models, which can  then be extended to analyze interactions between mechanics and  other physiological processes in the heart such as bloodflow.  'These new computer models will have diverse applications in  cardiac physiology, in the bioengineering design of new cardiac  diagnostic and treatment methods (such as cardiac ultrasound, MRI  and pacemakers) and as simulation tools for education and  training of doctors and patients, scientists, students and  engineers.  ***",
