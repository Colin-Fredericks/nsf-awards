This research will resolve several questions concerning crustal magmatism by integrating experimental, analytical, and field study of three migmatite complexes that are inferred to have formed by partial melting of crustal rocks and that are spatially associated with silicic plutons. A new intermediate-level class for undergraduates will be created based in part on going and proposed research in Turkey. This new class (Geology, Environment and Civilization) will focus on giving students a basic understanding of earth systems and human interactions with the physical environment, emphasizing the role of geology in the development and evolution of ancient and modern civilizations. All stages of the research will be integrated with the undergraduate and graduate petrology curricula at UNC-CH.",
