 "awd_abstract_narration": "9513184  White  Yeast ribosomal protein L32, RPL32, binds to its own transcript and prevents splicing.  The RNA binding target can be reduced to as few at 24 nucleotides folded into a stem-internal loop-stem motif where the loop  is purine-rich and is closed by a potential G:U pair.  Previous experiments have localized the site of protein contact to the loop and some preliminary work to explore the sequence requirements for protein binding has been completed.  The experiments proposed herein directly address the question of hydrogen bonding within the internal loop.  Chemical modification of the hydrogen bonding faces of those bases not involved in pairing will be detected by primer extension methods.  NMR  spectra will be collected to detect imino protons protected from exchange with water.  Imino and amino resonances which are visible are probably involved in hydrogen bonds.  Probing the protein structure and its interface with RNA  makes up the second part of the proposal.  At present, only the primary structure of the protein in known and there are no obvious regions related to RNA  binding domains of other proteins.  At the outset, the purification protocol will be improved and the purified protein will be subjected to analysis of the protein, the CD spectrum of the complex will be compared to that of the RNA to determine whether protein binding changes the helicity of the RNA.  To determine which protein residues contact the RNA, crosslinking experiments will be carried out using native and modified RNA.  As a complement to these experiments, a type of \"footprinting\" experiment will be done on the protein to see what portions of the protein may be protected from hydrolysis on RNA binding.  These experiments will require some work to develop practical, general techniques which work for all RNA protein complexes.  In the third and final portion of the proposal, the mechanism of repression is examined.  Evidence from  one laboratory suggests that the U1 snRNP binds to the L32RNA/RPL32 complex  to form a termolecular complex incapable of splicing. The initial hypothesis is that the U1 RNA strengthens the binding of  L32 RNA to RPL32 and that the dissociation of RPL32 is slowed or prevented by complexation with the two RNAs. The Education Plan is based on the first three years of teaching at Bryn Mawr College. The overriding curricular philosophy is to devise genuine chemistry courses which convey the current excitement in biochemistry.  Every attempt is made to challenge  the students to become active, critical learners who see themselves as participants in the scientific enterprise.  Given Bryn Mawr's mission to  educate young women, it is particularly important to encourage its students to realize their scientific ambitions.  For undergraduates, a full year of  research is often the culmination of their liberal arts education and is frequently their first truly independent research experience.  It is a challenge to design projects where students can do successful experiments while contributing to the progress of the laboratory. Problem solving, visualizing molecules, moles, equilibria, and kinetics are still vital parts of  General Chemistry which students must master.  The challenge of teaching at the introductory level is thus to simultaneously hold the students' interest and insist that they develop the skills needed for future work in science.  %%%  This research involves the study of the structure of an RNA involved in regulating the production of a protein.  Unlike DNA, which forms a symmetric, elongated double helix, RNA forms a complex, convoluted shape.  While all of DNA's bases are involved in either G-C or A-T pairs, in RNA some bases are paired but others are not.  The first portion of the research involves determining which bases pair.  Due to its complicated structure, RNA presents a variety of features which could be recognized by a protein.  In the system under study, a small protein binds to a portion of an RNA which has both non-standard base pairs and unpaired bas es.  Experiments will be done to define how the RNA and protein features contribute to this molecular recognition event.  When the protein is bound to the RNA, its biological function is blocked.  Model experiments will be designed to test mechanisms for this repression of protein production. The teaching of biological chemistry to advanced students and introductory chemistry is discussed in the education plan.  The common theme is to challenge the students to learn a rigorous experimental science while sharing in the excitement of current developments in biochemistry.  ***",
