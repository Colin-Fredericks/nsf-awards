 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9312581  Yacout     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to extend and refine a photon backscatter technique for detecting corrosion that is hidden from direct external observation. The technique involves scanning a collimated source photon beam (and its associated collimated detector) over limited ranges near an external surface, offering rapid nondestructive examination. Phase II will be concerned with demonstrating operation and optimizing design of laboratory prototype equipment to inspect systems that have both thin (< 4 mm) and thick (> 4 mm) external layers (covers) in both planar and cylindrical geometries. A simulation code developed during the Phase I study will be upgraded to incorporate polyenergetic source emission, both slab and general cylindrical geometries, photon detection over distributed energies (allowing spectral analysis of simulation results), and an expanded material library that will allow a variety of conditions to be simulated. The code will be used to identify promising design conditions for experimental investigation. Laboratory bench-top prototype equipment will be designed, constructed, and tested over a range of both design and sample variables. Design variables will be optimized for both thin- and thick-cover conditions.    The methodology has direct application to detection of hidden and inaccessible corrosion in various man-made systems including aircraft, ships, pipes, storage and processing tanks, buildings and bridges. Damage to such structures due to corrosion costs many millions of dollars per year and compromises safety.  ***",
