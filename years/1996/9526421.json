 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for support for the recovery of a 1000-meter ice  core from Siple Dome, Antarctica and the coordination of a  science management office for the scientific program.  The  proposed project is part of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS)  program, which seeks to understand the current behavior of the  West Antarctic ice sheet and to decipher its past climate  history.  Siple Dome is located between ice streams C and D and  is well-situated to investigate coastal climate conditions and  the dynamics of the Siple Coast ice streams which drain the West  Antarctic ice sheet.  The annual accumulation at the site is 7 to  11 cm of ice per year and it is anticipated that annual layers  will be identifiable to an age of at least 6,000 years before  present.  The length of the usable climate record will extend to  at least 80,000 years before present.  This proposal provides the  background for the Siple Dome drilling program and develops the  opportunity for individual scientists (who have submitted  separate proposals) to work on the ice core .  This proposal  would establish a Science Coordination Office that would  coordinate the activities of the various organizations involved  in the project, including the National Science Foundation (NSF),  the Polar Ice Coring Office (PICO), Antarctic Support Associates  (ASA), and the National Ice Core Laboratory (NICL).",
