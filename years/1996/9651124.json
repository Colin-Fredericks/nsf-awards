 "awd_abstract_narration": "A computer laboratory is being developed for interactive pre- and post-chemistry laboratory assessment and instruction of students in general and organic chemistry, and to provide computer laboratory teaching experiences for preservice high school chemistry teachers. The computer laboratory enables teachers to reinforce learning by showing students how \"wet\" laboratory experiences can be integrated with lecture ideas in terms of concepts being covered and laboratory skills being practiced. Quicktime movies allow presentation of, and questioning about, reactions that are too dangerous to have students do in the laboratory. Students view, and are quizzed on, Quicktime video clips on safe use of laboratory equipment. For prelaboratory instruction, the computer environment provides an opportunity for students to take part in interactive questioning to determine whether they have the knowledge needed to complete the laboratory successfully.    The \"wet\" laboratory environment is an important part of chemistry that is not to be replaced by computer facilities. Students are using calculator interfaced laboratory methods of acquiring and analyzing data from \"wet\" lab experiments as a part of this project. The postlaboratory computer lab can be a place for students to be assessed on their learning of the laboratory material, to extend their learning, and to be guided by further work if deficiencies are revealed. The facility also provides preservice teachers an avenue for developing and using instructional and assessment materials to facilitate chemistry learning. The 2-year implementation period includes both formative and summative evaluations that enhance instruction and quizzing practices used in the project.  Materials from the project are being made available to others through computers (World Wide Web), workshops, and print.",
