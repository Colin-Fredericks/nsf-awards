 "awd_abstract_narration": "9601958  Bernard  This Academic Research Infrastructure Award provides funds for a Silicon Graphics Inc. Power Challenge with 16 MIPS R10000 processors with 2 Gigabytes of 8-way interleaved RAM, a 4-node HiPPI network switch, and a 21.3 Gigabyte RAID disk. This high performance computing engine will be integrated with existing immersive environments and dedicated to the support of numerically demanding real-time simulations controlled from synthetic environments for engineering problem solving.     The equipment provided by this grant will make possible the development of an integrated environment with computational and immersive visualization capabilities to support research in intelligence amplification for engineering. Intelligence amplification enables engineers to immerse themselves in the problem or phenomena under study using haptic, visual and audio cues to support real-time communications between the user of the   environment and the numerical simulations. This will be a paradigm shift for engineering design and manufacturing. Engineers will be able to cost-effectively perform \"what if\" studies while obtaining immediate feedback. This environment also will have a significant impact on the engineers of the next century by providing graduate and undergraduate students of today with a unique research environment that will prepare them for leadership positions in a variety of careers involving the application   of these new technologies.  ***",
