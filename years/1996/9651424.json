 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern methods of analysis in chemistry and biology involve molecular separations of complicated mixtures. Often separations on large numbers of samples are necessary in order to reveal important trends. This problem is particularly evident in behavioral and ecological studies where the need to determine kinship among large numbers of individual plants and insects using DNA fingerprinting methods is critical. The final step in these analyses is a separation of pieces of DNA. However, the traditional electrophoresis methods of separation are labor intensive and slow.   Capillary electrophoresis represents a powerful technique that provides rapid separation of charged molecules such as proteins and DNA. This project incorporates the use of a capillary electrophoresis instrument into several biology and chemistry courses. The instrument can be used by undergraduate students in biology courses to separate fragments of DNA as a means of fingerprinting individual plants and insects in behavioral and ecological studies. It can also be used by chemistry undergraduates to study the ionic speciation of acids and bases and mechanisms of separation. Environmental chemistry students look at ionic pollutants in rain and run-off waters, and biochemistry students use the instrument to separate proteins, DNA, and small molecules in projects of their own design. The efficiency of the instrument permits the analysis of large numbers of samples, which increases the probability of observing statistically significant trends. Since the experimental preparations are simpler than older methods, the use of capillary electrophoresis also frees up laboratory time for additional focus on the scientific principles of the study.   Innovative applications, advantages, and limitations of using capillary electrophoresis in student labs will be disseminated through two workshops, publications, and the World Wide Web.",
