A unique thread in our theoretical  approach is the use of classical analytic function interpolation  and convex optimization techniques which appear to be extremely  useful but are yet to be exploited for system identification.   The proposed research, with a unifying theme on model and  computational complexity, focuses on several most imminent issues  that are yet to be addressed but are critical to the advance and  application of robust control-oriented identification techniques,  and it aims at developing accurate, computationally efficient and  practically feasible identification algorithms not previously  available.  Numerical simulation and experimental validation  involving flexible structures, turbo-machines, and active  magnetic bearings will be performed in laboratory, and in  collaboration with government and industrial organizations.       Education and human resource development constitutes an  integrable part in this proposed research.  The principal  education objective in this research is to provide students  opportunities to participate in advanced research projects.   Through this rigorous, innovative, and closely guided research  program, the students will acquire and develop knowledge, skills,  and methods of scientific inquiry and technological discovery,  hence adequately preparing them for an engineering career in the  future.  A carefully coordinated, balanced,and systematic  educational approach through a combination of activities in  student advising, curriculum development, laboratory development,  and public services will be employed to achieve this goal. While  graduate students at the Doctoral and the Masters levels will  participate directly in this research, the project will  also  benefit Senior undergraduate students through summer research and  Senior design projects generated from this research.  ***",
