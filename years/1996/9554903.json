 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important difficulty faced by undergraduate Earth Science  students is learning how to identify minerals in thin sections of  rocks under a microscope. We will develop computer software  (PetroDisc) to help students understand minerals and textures in  thin sections of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. The  application will be an interactive tutorial that draws  photomicrographs from a CD-ROM or laser disk. Multiple images  (plane and cross polarized light, stage rotation, reflected light,  interference figures, cathodoluminescence, etc.) of the same thin  section will simulate a petrographic microscope and illustrate the  fundamental properties of minerals in thin sections. Each mineral  grain on the image will be keyed to a database of mineral names,  optical, compositional, and x-ray properties. Students will be  able to interactively explore a series of thin sections,  amplifying a laboratory instructor's effectiveness. Extended work  with this program should increase their ability to identify  minerals and manipulate various kinds of petrographic data  (including x-ray maps, back scattered electron images, modal  abundances, and crystal size distributions). PetroDisc will be  constructed by a small team of geologists and an instructional  programmer. Early versions of the program will be evaluated in  laboratory classes, by other petrologists, and by making a  prototype available for use and comment on the Internet before it  is released. PetroDisc will be supplied by BYU to Earth Science  departments at colleges and universities for minimal cost.",
